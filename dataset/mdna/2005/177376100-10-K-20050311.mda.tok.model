acquisitions net on december   we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of net  inc or net  a leader in providing secure access gateways 
the acquisition extends our ability to provide easy and secure access to virtually any resource  both data and voice  on demand 
the results of operations of net are included in our results of operations beginning after december  as part of our americas geographic segment 
the consideration for this transaction was approximately million paid in cash 
in addition to the purchase price  there were direct transaction costs associated with the acquisition of approximately million 
the sources of funds for consideration paid in this transaction consisted of available cash and investments 
expertcity on february   we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of expertcity 
com  inc or expertcity  a market leader in web based desktop access as well as a leader in web based training and customer assistance products 
the results of operations of expertcity are included in our results of operations beginning after february  the consideration for this transaction was approximately million  comprised of approximately million in cash  approximately million shares of our common stock valued at approximately million and direct transaction costs of approximately million 
these amounts include additional common stock earned by expertcity upon the achievement of certain revenue and other financial milestones during pursuant to the merger agreement  which will be issued during the fair value of the common stock earned as additional purchase price consideration was recorded as goodwill on the date earned 
the sources of funds for consideration paid in this transaction consisted of available cash and investments and our authorized common stock 
there is no further contingent consideration related to the transaction 
purchase accounting for our acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting  the purchase price was allocated to expertcity s and net s respective net tangible and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values 
independent valuation specialists assisted us in determining the fair values of a significant portion of the net assets associated with these transactions 
the allocation of the purchase price is summarized below in thousands expertcity net purchase price allocation asset life purchase price allocation asset life current assets property and equipment  various various in process research and development intangible assets  years  years goodwill  indefinite  indefinite assets acquired current liabilities deferred tax liability total liabilities assumed net assets acquired  including direct transaction costs 
table of contents net assets acquired from expertcity consisted mainly of cash and investments  accounts receivable  deferred revenues and other current liabilities 
net liabilities acquired from net consisted mainly of cash  accounts receivable  deferred revenues and other current and long term liabilities 
intangible assets acquired in the expertcity acquisition are comprised of core and product technologies  trade names  covenants not to compete and customer relationships 
intangible assets acquired in the net acquisition are comprised of core and product technologies  customer relationships and covenants not to compete 
the goodwill recorded in relation to these acquisitions is not deductible for tax purposes 
the valuation of the trade names for expertcity was determined based on assigning a royalty rate to the revenue stream that was expected from the services using the trade name 
the pre tax royalty rate was applied to the product revenue and discounted to a present value 
the valuation of core and product technology was based on the estimated discounted future cash flows associated with expertcity s and net s existing products 
the value of customer relationships was determined based on expertcity s and net s estimated future discounted cash flows of the relationships in place after considering historical attrition rates 
we expensed purchased in process research and development of approximately million related to the expertcity acquisition and million related to the net acquisition immediately upon the closing of the mergers 
for more information regarding the in process research and development acquired from expertcity  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations and note to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
we base these estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and these estimates form the basis for our judgments concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we periodically evaluate these estimates and judgments based on available information and experience 
actual results could differ from our estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
if actual results significantly differ from our estimates  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted 
we believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business  results of operations and financial condition because they involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the development  selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
other significant accounting policies  primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below  are also critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to our accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this discussion 
revenue recognition 
the accounting related to revenue recognition in the software industry is complex and affected by interpretations of the rules and an understanding of industry practices  both of which are subject to change 
as a result  revenue recognition accounting rules require us to make significant judgments 
in addition  our judgment is required in assessing the probability of collection  which is generally based on evaluation of customer specific information  historical collection experience and economic market conditions 
we sell most of our metaframe access suite products bundled with an initial subscription for software license updates that provide the end user with free enhancements and upgrades to the licensed product on a when and if available basis 
customers may also elect to purchase technical support  product training or consulting services 
we allocate revenue to software license updates and any other undelivered elements of the arrangement based on vendor specific objective 
table of contents evidence  or vsoe  of fair value of each element and such amounts are deferred until the applicable delivery criteria and other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
the balance of the revenue  net of any discounts inherent in the arrangement  is allocated to the delivered software product using the residual method and recognized at the outset of the arrangement as the software licenses are delivered 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of each undelivered element based on vsoe  we defer revenue recognition until all elements are delivered  all services have been performed  or until fair value can be objectively determined 
we must apply judgment in determining all elements of the arrangement and in determining the vsoe of fair value for each element  considering the price charged for each product or applicable renewal rates for software license updates 
in the normal course of business  we do not permit product returns  but we do provide most of our distributors and value added resellers with stock balancing and price protection rights 
stock balancing rights permit distributors to return products to us up to the forty fifth day of the fiscal quarter  subject to ordering an equal dollar amount of our other products prior to the last day of the same fiscal quarter 
price protection rights require that we grant retroactive price adjustments for inventories of our products held by distributors or resellers if we lower our prices for such products 
we establish provisions for estimated returns for stock balancing and price protection rights  as well as other sales allowances  concurrently with the recognition of revenue 
the provisions are established based upon consideration of a variety of factors  including  among other things  recent and historical return rates for both specific products and distributors  estimated distributor inventory levels by product  the impact of any new product releases and projected economic conditions 
actual product returns for stock balancing and price protection provisions incurred are  however  dependent upon future events  including the amount of stock balancing activity by our distributors and the level of distributor inventories at the time of any price adjustments 
we continually monitor the factors that influence the pricing of our products and distributor inventory levels and make adjustments to these provisions when we believe actual returns and other allowances could differ from established reserves 
our ability to recognize revenue upon shipment to our distributors is predicated on our ability to reliably estimate future stock balancing returns 
if actual experience or changes in market condition impairs our ability to estimate returns  we would be required to defer the recognition of revenue until the delivery of the product to the end user 
allowances for estimated product returns amounted to approximately million at december  and million at december  the decrease in allowances for estimated product returns is a reflection of the decrease in stock rotation experience primarily due to a reduction in packaged product inventory held by our distributors resulting from an increase in enterprise customer license arrangements  which are typically delivered electronically 
we have not reduced and have no current plans to reduce our prices for inventory currently held by distributors or resellers 
accordingly  there were no reserves required for price protection at december  or december  we also record reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including volume based incentives  at the time the sale is recorded 
if market conditions were to decline  we could take actions to increase our customer incentive offerings  which could result in an incremental reduction to our revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
core and product technology assets 
we review acquired core and product technology assets for impairment on a periodic basis by comparing the estimated net realizable value to the unamortized cost of the technology 
we have acquired our core and product technology assets primarily from our net  expertcity and sequoia acquisitions as well as under other third party agreements 
the core and product technology assets acquired in our net acquisition will extend our ability to provide easy and secure access through our metaframe access suite of products 
the core and product technology assets acquired in our expertcity acquisition form the basis of our citrix online division and the assets acquired in our sequoia acquisition  as well as under other third party agreements  form the basis for our metaframe secure access manager product 
the recoverability of these technologies is primarily dependent upon our ability to commercialize these products 
the estimated net realizable value of the purchased sequoia and other technology is based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with our metaframe secure access manager 
the estimated net realizable value of the purchased expertcity technology is based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with our citrix online services 
our revenues are forecasted based on historical sales  data received from rate projections on our subscribing customer base and estimates from our sales channels and end customer sales force 
our assumptions about future revenues and expenses require significant judgment associated with the forecast of metaframe secure access manager and our citrix online products 
actual revenues and costs could vary significantly from these forecasted amounts 
as of december   the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from core and product technology assets from these acquisitions is sufficient to recover their carrying value 
if these products are not ultimately accepted by our customers  and there is no alternative future use for this technology  we could determine that some or all of their remaining million carrying value is impaired 
in the event of impairment  we would record an impairment charge to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents on december   we acquired net  which resulted in additional core and product technology of million  net of amortization  at december  for more information concerning our acquisition of net  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations acquisitions 
goodwill 
at december   we had million in goodwill primarily related to our acquisitions of net  expertcity and sequoia 
the goodwill recorded in relation to these acquisitions is not deductible for tax purposes 
we operate in a single market consisting of the design  development  marketing and support of access infrastructure software  hardware and services for enterprise applications 
our revenues are derived from sales in the americas  europe  the middle east and africa  or emea  and asia pacific regions and from our citrix online division 
these three geographic regions and the citrix online division constitute our reportable segments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our reportable segments 
we evaluate goodwill along these segments  which represent our reporting units 
substantially all of our goodwill at december  was associated with our americas and citrix online reportable segments 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard or sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
 our goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to an annual impairment test 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we ceased amortizing goodwill with a net book value at january  of million  including million of acquired workforce previously classified as purchased intangible assets 
excluding goodwill  we have no intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives 
we use judgment in assessing goodwill for impairment 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually  or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount could exceed fair value 
fair values are based on discounted cash flows using a discount rate determined by our management to be consistent with industry discount rates and the risks inherent in our current business model 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we completed the required impairment tests of goodwill at the date of adoption and annually as required 
there were no impairment charges recorded as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
or annual impairment tests 
due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy and product portfolio  it is possible that the forecasts we use to support our goodwill could change in the future  which could result in non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
current and deferred tax assets 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company has million in net deferred tax assets 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if  based on the weight of the evidence  it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
management reviews deferred tax assets periodically for recoverability and makes estimates and judgments regarding the expected geographic sources of taxable income  gains from investments  as well as tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
at december   we determined that a valuation allowance of approximately million relating to foreign tax credit carryovers was necessary to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized 
if the estimates and assumptions used in our determination change in the future  we could be required to revise our estimates of the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and adjust our provisions for additional income taxes 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain  thus judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes 
we provide for income taxes on transactions based on our estimate of the probable liability 
we adjust our provision as appropriate for changes that impact our underlying judgments 
changes that impact provision estimates include such items as jurisdictional interpretations on tax filing positions based on the results of tax audits and general tax authority rulings 
due to the evolving nature of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate  it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability and the realizability of our deferred tax assets could change in the future  which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
stock based compensation disclosures our stock option program is a broad based  long term retention program that is intended to attract and reward talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests 
the number and frequency of stock option grants are based on competitive practices  our operating results  the number of options available for grant under our shareholder approved plans  and other factors 
all employees are eligible to participate in the stock option program

net revenues 
our operations consist of the design  development  marketing and support of access infrastructure software and services that enable effective and efficient enterprise wide deployment and management of applications and information 
net revenues include the following categories software licenses  software license updates  services  and other 
software licenses primarily represents fees related to the licensing of our metaframe access suite products 
these revenues are reflected net of sales allowances and provisions for stock balancing return rights 
the metaframe presentation server product accounted for approximately of our software license revenue for the year ended december   of our software license revenue for the year ended december  and of our software license revenue for the year ended december  software license updates consists of fees related to our subscription advantage program our terminology for post contract support that are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is typically to months 
subscription advantage is an annual renewable program that provides subscribers with automatic delivery of software upgrades  enhancements and maintenance releases when and if they become available during the term of the subscription 
services consist primarily of technical support services and web based desktop access services revenue recognized ratably over the contract term  revenue from product training and certification  and consulting services revenue related to implementation of our software products  which are recognized as the services are provided 
in may  we entered into a five year joint license  development and marketing agreement with the microsoft corporation or the microsoft development agreement  which expired in may other revenues in represents the royalty fees recognized in connection with the microsoft development agreement 
net revenues increased million during compared to software license revenue decreased million during primarily due to a weakness in our packaged product sales which are typically purchased by medium and small sized businesses 
software license updates revenue increased million during primarily due to a larger base of subscribers and increasing renewal rates related to our subscription advantage program 
services revenue increased 
table of contents million during primarily due to the addition of the citrix online division resulting from our february expertcity acquisition 
we currently expect subscription advantage to continue to be of strategic importance to our business in because it fosters long term customer relationships and gives us improved visibility and predictability due to the recurring nature of this revenue stream 
in january  we launched our advisor rewards program which gives sales incentives to resellers for the sale of certain license types 
in the third quarter of  we extended our advisor rewards program to a broader range of license types  which we anticipate will continue to stimulate demand for our metaframe products from smaller customers and projects 
revenues associated with our advisor rewards program is partially offset by the associated incentives to our resellers 
net revenues increased million during compared to software license revenue increased million during primarily due to an increase in software licenses  revenue from the sale of citrix metaframe presentation server  under enterprise customer license arrangements 
also  the increase over was partially due to weakness during in packaged product sales to our distributors and resellers  associated with a reduction in packaged product inventory held by our distributors and overall weakness in it spending during software license updates revenue increased million during compared to primarily due to the continued acceptance of our renewable subscription advantage program 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in other revenue of million during associated with the expiration of the microsoft development agreement in may deferred revenues  primarily related to citrix subscription advantage and services revenues  increased approximately million compared to december  the significant increase was due primarily to increased renewals of citrix subscription advantage  and the services sold by our citrix online division  which were acquired from expertcity 
we expect deferred revenue to increase in due primarily to currently expected increases in both annual contract adoptions for citrix online services and subscription advantage renewals 
international and segment revenues 
international revenues sales outside of the united states accounted for approximately of our net revenues for the year ended december   of our net revenues for the year ended december   and of our net revenues for the year ended december  an analysis of our reportable segment net revenue is presented below year ended december  revenue growth to revenue growth to americas emea asia pacific citrix online division other consolidated net revenues our americas segment is comprised of the united states  canada and latin america

the increase in net revenues during as compared to was due primarily to the factors mentioned above across all geographic segments 
for additional information on international revenues  please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of the compensation costs and other personnel related costs of providing services and amortization of core and product technology  as well as costs of product media and duplication  manuals  packaging materials and shipping expense service capacity costs and royalties 
cost of software licenses revenues decreased million in as compared to due primarily to a decrease in royalties due to the expiration of certain 
table of contents license agreements 
cost of services revenues increased million in compared to primarily due to the addition of our citrix online division resulting from the february expertcity acquisition 
amortization of core and product technology decreased million in as compared to primarily due to the reclassification of certain intangible tax assets related to a acquisition from a product technology intangible asset to goodwill resulting in an approximately million reduction in amortization expense partially offset due to an increase in amortization expense related to core and product technology intangible assets acquired in the expertcity acquisition 
cost of revenues for software licenses revenues  cost of services revenues and amortization of core and product technology for remained relatively unchanged compared to gross margin 
gross margin as a percent of revenue was for  for and for the increase in gross margin as a percentage of net revenue in compared to was primarily due to the decrease in cost of revenues as discussed above 
we currently anticipate that in the next twelve months  gross margin as a percentage of net revenues will remain relatively unchanged as compared with current levels 
gross margin  however  will fluctuate from time to time based on a number of factors attributable to the cost of revenues as discussed above 
operating expenses 
as further discussed below  during we reduced our worldwide workforce by approximately approximately employees and consolidated certain functions from our salt lake city  utah and columbia  maryland facilities into our fort lauderdale  florida facility 
as a result of such actions  we incurred expenses of approximately million  primarily for severance and related facility expenses  of which approximately million were included in research and development expenses  million were included in sales  marketing and support expenses and million were included in general and administrative expenses 
our results of operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to minimize the impact on our operating results  we generally initiate our hedging of currency exchange risks one year in advance of anticipated foreign currency expenses 
as a result of this policy  foreign currency denominated expenses will be higher or lower in the current year depending on the weakness or strength of the dollar in the prior year 
since the us dollar was generally weak in  we currently expect that operating expenses will be higher in but further dollar weakness in will not have a further material adverse impact on our operating expenses until as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  we currently account for share based payments to employees using the apb opinion no 
intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires companies to expense the value of employee stock options and similar awards 
sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no

r for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date

research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel related costs 
we expense substantially all development costs included in the research and development of software products and enhancements to existing products as incurred except for certain core technologies with alternative future use 
research and development expenses increased approximately million during as compared to primarily due to increased headcount and related personnel costs  as well as an increase in staffing and associated personnel costs related to the expertcity acquisition 
during  we expect research and development expenses to increase as we continue to make investments in our business and hire personnel to achieve our product development goals 

table of contents research and development expenses decreased approximately million during as compared to  primarily due to severance  relocation and reduced headcount costs and related facility charges associated with the consolidation of our salt lake city  utah and columbia  maryland development teams into our remaining engineering facilities in fort lauderdale  florida during these decreases were partially offset by an increase in costs for external consultants and developers 
sales  marketing and support expenses 
sales  marketing and support expenses increased approximately million during as compared to  primarily due to the hiring of additional sales personnel and related personnel costs and increases in commissions and other variable compensation costs due to the achievement of targeted sales goals and an increase in staffing and associated personnel costs related to the expertcity acquisition 
in addition  there was an increase in marketing program costs resulting from our worldwide brand awareness and advertising campaign and from the marketing of services related to our citrix online division  which were introduced in the first quarter of these increases were partially offset by an increase in the allocation of certain revenue generating services expenses from operating expense to cost of services revenues 
during  we currently expect sales  marketing and support expenses to increase as we continue to make investments in our business to achieve our strategic goals 
sales  marketing and support expenses increased approximately million during as compared to primarily due to increases in commissions and other variable compensation costs due to the achievement of targeted sales goals 
in addition and to a lesser extent  the increase in marketing program costs resulted primarily from our launch of a worldwide brand awareness and advertising campaign and increases in product training costs and reseller commissions associated with the increase in our software license updates 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately million during as compared to primarily due to an increase in external consulting and services associated with regulatory compliance requirements and information systems  an increase in headcount and related personnel costs as well as an increase in staffing and associated personnel costs related to the expertcity acquisition 
general and administrative expenses decreased approximately million during as compared to due primarily to a decrease in depreciation expense resulting from asset maturities and the abandonment of certain leasehold improvements during and a decrease in our provision for doubtful accounts 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation resulting from the achievement of our financial targets and an increase in insurance costs 
amortization of other intangible assets 
amortization of other intangible assets increased approximately million in as compared to primarily due to an increase in amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in the expertcity acquisition 
as of december   we had unamortized other identified intangible assets with estimable useful lives in the net amount of million 
amortization of intangible assets remained relatively unchanged in compared to amortization expense totaled million during  million during and million in we currently expect amortization expense to increase during as a result of our acquisitions 
for more information regarding the net and expertcity acquisitions see  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations acquisitions and note to our consolidated financial statements 
in process research and development 
during  we acquired expertcity and net and an aggregate of approximately million of the respective purchase prices were allocated to in process research and development  or ipr d 
the amounts allocated to ipr d had not yet reached technological feasibility  had no alternative future use and were written off at the date of the acquisitions in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 applicability of fasb statement no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method 
there were no write offs of ipr d during and for more information regarding the acquisitions  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations acquisitions and note to our consolidated financial statements 
our efforts with respect to the acquired technologies currently consist of design and development that may be required to support the release of the technologies into updated versions of existing service offerings and potentially new product and service offerings by our citrix online division 
we currently expect that we will successfully develop new products or services utilizing the acquired in process technology  but there can be no assurance that commercial viability of future product or service offerings will be achieved 
furthermore  future developments in the software industry  changes in 
table of contents technology  changes in other products and offerings or other developments may cause us to alter or abandon product plans 
failure to complete the development of projects in their entirety  or in a timely manner  could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the fair value assigned to ipr d was based on valuations prepared using methodologies and valuation techniques consistent with those used by independent appraisers 
all fair values were determined using the income approach  which includes estimating the revenue and expenses associated with a project s sales cycle and by estimating the amount of after tax cash flows attributable to the projects 
the future cash flows were discounted to present value utilizing an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return  which ranged from to

other income expense  net remained relatively constant during compared to the million increase in other income expense  net during compared to was due primarily to a decline in remeasurement and foreign currency transaction losses  as well as  realized gains on the sale of certain of our available for sale investments in income taxes 
on october   the american jobs creation act  or the ajca  was signed into law 
the ajca includes a deduction for of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated  as defined in the ajca 
we may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in we have started an evaluation of the repatriation provision  however  we do not expect to be able to complete this evaluation until after congress or the treasury department provides guidance concerning key elements of the provision 
we expect to complete our evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision within a reasonable period of time following the publication of the anticipated guidance 
based on the provisions of the ajca  the range of possible amounts that we are eligible to repatriate under this provision is between zero and million 
as such  the related potential range of income tax is between zero and million 
we maintain certain operational and administrative processes in overseas subsidiaries and our foreign earnings are taxed at lower foreign tax rates 
other than through the one time repatriation provision within the ajca  we do not expect to remit earnings from our foreign subsidiaries 
accordingly  since we have not provided for deferred taxes on foreign earnings 
in  our effective tax rate decreased to from in  primarily due to an increase in annual taxable income in our geographic locations that are taxed at a lower rate 
in  our effective tax rate increased to from in primarily due to an increase in annual taxable income in our geographic locations that are taxed at a higher rate 
our effective tax rate may fluctuate throughout based on a number of factors including variations in estimated taxable

cash and investments as of december   we had million in cash and investments compared to million at december  additionally  at december   we had million of restricted cash equivalents and investments  see restricted cash equivalents and investments below 
the million decrease in cash and investments as compared to december   was due primarily to the redemption of our convertible subordinated debentures and expenditures related to our expertcity and net acquisitions partially offset by positive cash flow from operations and stock option exercises 
we generally invest our cash and cash equivalents in investment grade  highly liquid securities to allow for flexibility in the event of immediate cash needs 
our short and long term investments primarily consist of interest bearing securities 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources convertible subordinated debentures and notes and to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
included in short term investments in were million in aaa rated zero coupon corporate securities classified as held to maturity investments that matured on march  at december   we had no investments classified as held to maturity 
restricted cash equivalents and investments as of december   we had million in restricted cash equivalents and investments 
approximately million in investment securities and cash equivalents were pledged as collateral for specified obligations under our synthetic lease and approximately million in investment securities were pledged as collateral for certain of our credit default contracts and interest rate swaps 
the million increase in restricted cash and investments compared to december  is primarily due to an increase in the liability position of the interest rate swaps associated with the contracts being 
table of contents collateralized 
restricted cash at december  is comprised of cash equivalents  short term and long term investments 
we maintain the ability to manage the composition of the restricted cash equivalents and investments within certain limits to withdraw and use excess investment earnings from the pledged collateral for operating purposes 
for further information regarding our synthetic lease  credit default contracts and interest rate swaps  see notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable  net at december   we had approximately million in accounts receivable  net of allowances 
the increase of million in accounts receivable as compared to was primarily due to an increase in sales  particularly in the last month of the year 
our allowance for returns is million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease of million is comprised of million in credits issued for stock balancing rights during partially offset by million of provisions for returns recorded during the overall decrease in our allowance for returns is primarily due to a reduction in packaged product inventory held by our distributors 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease of million is comprised of million of uncollectible accounts written off  net of recoveries  partially offset by million of provisions for doubtful accounts recorded during the year and million of provisions for doubtful accounts associated with accounts receivable acquired in our expertcity and net acquisitions 
from time to time  we could maintain individually significant accounts receivable balances from our distributors or customers  which are comprised of large business enterprises  governments and small and medium sized businesses 
if the financial condition of our distributors or customers deteriorates  our operating results could be adversely affected 
at december  and  no distributor or customer accounted for more than of our accounts receivable 
for more information regarding significant customers see note to our consolidated financial statements 
convertible subordinated debentures in march  we sold million principal amount at maturity of our zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures  or the debentures  due march   in a private placement 
the debentures were priced with a yield to maturity of and resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million  net of original issue discount and net of debt issuance costs of approximately million 
in october  the board of directors approved a program authorizing us to repurchase up to million of the debentures in open market purchases 
additionally  in april  the board of directors granted additional authority of million to us to repurchase debentures through private transactions  bringing the total repurchase authority to million 
the board of directors authorization to repurchase the debentures allowed us to repurchase debentures when market conditions were favorable 
as of december    units of our debentures representing million in principal amount at maturity  had been repurchased under these programs for million 
on march   we redeemed all of the outstanding debentures for an aggregate redemption price of approximately million 
we used the proceeds from our held to maturity investments that matured on march  and cash on hand to fund the redemption 
at the date of redemption  we incurred a charge for the associated deferred debt issuance costs of approximately million 
stock repurchase program as of december   our board of directors authorized an ongoing stock repurchase program with a total repurchase authority granted to us of million 
in february  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional million  increasing the total authority to billion 
the objective of our stock repurchase program is to manage actual and anticipated dilution and to improve shareholders return 
at december   approximately million was available to repurchase common stock pursuant to the stock repurchase program 
all shares repurchased are recorded as treasury stock 
we are authorized to make open market purchases of our common stock using general corporate funds 
additionally  from time to time  we have entered into structured stock repurchase arrangements with large financial institutions using general corporate funds as part of our stock repurchase program in order to lower our average cost to acquire shares 
these programs include terms that require us to make up front payments to a counterparty financial institution and result in the receipt of stock during or at the end of the period of the agreement or the receipt of either stock or cash at the maturity of the agreement 
delivery of stock under certain programs may be dependent on market conditions 
prior to june  we sold 
table of contents put warrants that entitled the holder of each warrant to sell to us  generally by physical delivery  one share of our common stock at a specified price 
at december  there were no put warrants outstanding 
we expended an aggregate of million and million during and  respectively  net of premiums received  under all stock repurchase transactions 
during  we took delivery of a total of  shares of outstanding common stock with an average per share price of  and during  we took delivery of a total of  shares of outstanding common stock with an average per share price of 
some of these shares were received pursuant to prepaid programs 
since inception of our stock repurchase programs  the average cost of shares acquired was per share compared to an average close price during open trading windows of per share 
in addition  a significant portion of the funds used to repurchase stock was funded by proceeds from employee stock option exercises and the related tax benefit 
we remain committed to our ongoing stock repurchase program 
as of december   we have remaining prepaid notional amounts of approximately million under our stock repurchase agreements 
as the total shares to be received for the open repurchase agreements at december  is not determinable until the contracts mature in  the above price per share amounts exclude the remaining shares to be received subject to the agreements 
historically  significant portions of our cash inflows were generated by our operations 
we currently expect this trend to continue throughout we believe that our existing cash and investments together with cash flows expected from operations will be sufficient to meet expected operating and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
we continue to search for suitable acquisition candidates and could acquire or make investments in companies we believe are related to our strategic objectives 
we could from time to time seek to raise additional funds through the issuance of debt or equity securities for larger acquisitions 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangement contractual obligations we have certain contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
other items  such as operating lease obligations  are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  but are required to be disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations synthetic lease obligations total contractual obligations total contractual obligations do not include agreements where our commitment is variable in nature or where cancellation without payment provisions exist 
as of december   we did not have any individually material long term debt obligations  capital lease obligations  purchase obligations  or other material long term commitments reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
off balance sheet arrangement during  we became a party to a synthetic lease arrangement totaling approximately million for our corporate headquarters office space in fort lauderdale  florida 
the synthetic lease represents a form of off balance sheet financing under which an unrelated third party lessor funded of the costs of acquiring the property and leases the asset to us 
the synthetic lease qualifies as an operating lease for accounting purposes and as a financing lease for tax purposes 
we do 
table of contents not include the property or the lease debt as an asset or a liability on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
consequently  payments made pursuant to the lease are recorded as operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income 
we entered into the synthetic lease in order to lease our headquarters properties under more favorable terms than under our previous lease arrangements 
we do not materially rely on off balance sheet arrangements for our liquidity or as capital resources 
for information regarding cash outflows associated with our lease payments see contractual obligations 
the initial term of the synthetic lease is seven years 
upon approval by the lessor  we can renew the lease twice for additional two year periods 
the lease payments vary based on the london interbank offered rate  or libor  plus a margin 
at any time during the lease term  we have the option to sublease the property and upon thirty days written notice  we have the option to purchase the property for an amount representing the original property cost and transaction fees of approximately million plus any lease breakage costs and outstanding amounts owed 
upon at least days notice prior to the termination of the initial lease term  we have the option to remarket the property for sale to a third party 
if we choose not to purchase the property at the end of the lease term  we have guaranteed a residual value to the lessor of approximately million and possession of the buildings will be returned to the lessor 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate the property for indications of permanent impairment 
if an evaluation were to indicate that the fair value of the property were to decline below million  we would be responsible for the difference under our residual value guarantee  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the synthetic lease includes certain financial covenants including a requirement for us to maintain a restricted balance of approximately million as collateral  which is classified as restricted cash equivalents and investments in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we maintain the ability to manage the composition of restricted investments within certain limits and to withdraw and use excess investment earnings from the pledged collateral for operating purposes 
additionally  we must maintain a minimum net cash and investment balance  collateralized investments and equity investments  of million  as of the end of each fiscal quarter 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and investments in excess of this required level 
the synthetic lease includes non financial covenants  including the maintenance of the property and adequate insurance  prompt delivery of financial statements to the administrative agent of the lessor and prompt payment of taxes associated with the property 
as of december   we were in compliance with all material provisions of the arrangement 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation  or fin  no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interests in the entity 
in december  the fasb issued fin no 
revised  which replaced fin no 
fin no 
revised was effective immediately for certain disclosure requirements and variable interest entities referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december  and for other types of entities for financial statements for periods ending after march  we determined that we are not required to consolidate the lessor  the leased facility or the related debt associated with our synthetic lease in accordance with fin no 
revised 
accordingly  there was no impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows from adoption 
however  if the lessor were to change its ownership of the property or significantly change its ownership of other properties that it currently holds  we could be required to consolidate the entity  the leased facility and the debt in a future period 
commitments capital expenditures were million during  million during and million during during  capital expenditures were primarily related to computer equipment purchases associated with our research and development activities and leasehold improvements 
the increase of million in capital expenditures during compared to is due to expenditures in for purchases of computer equipment related to existing and new research and development projects and leasehold improvements on renovations to currently occupied buildings 
in the normal course of business  we enter into commitments related to capital expenditures  however  we currently have no material contractual commitments for capital expenditures over the next months 
during and  we took actions to consolidate certain of our offices  including the exit of certain leased office space and the abandonment of certain leasehold improvements 
lease obligations related to these existing operating leases continue to with a total remaining obligation at december  of approximately million  of which million was accrued for as of december   and is reflected in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our 
table of contents consolidated financial statements 
in calculating this accrual  we made estimates  based on market information  including the estimated vacancy periods and sublease rates and opportunities 
we periodically re evaluate our estimates  and if actual circumstances prove to be materially worse than management has estimated  the total charges for these vacant facilities could be significantly higher 
certain factors which may affect future results our operating results and financial condition have varied in the past and could in the future vary significantly depending on a number of factors 
from time to time  information provided by us or statements made by our employees contain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
in particular  statements contained in this form k  and in the documents incorporated by reference into this form k  that are not historical facts  including  but not limited to statements concerning new products  product development and offerings  subscription advantage  product and price competition  citrix online division  competition and strategy  product price and inventory  contingent consideration payments  deferred revenues  economic and market conditions  revenue recognition  profits  growth of revenues  cost of revenues  operating expenses  sales  marketing and support expenses  research and development expenses valuations of investments and derivative instruments  technology relationships  reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings  gross margins  amortization expense and intangible assets  interest income  interest expense  impairment charges  anticipated operating and capital expenditure requirements  cash inflows  contractual obligations in process research and development  advertising campaigns  tax rates  leasing and subleasing activities  acquisitions  stock repurchases  investment transactions  liquidity  litigation matters  intellectual property matters  distribution channels  stock price  advisor rewards program  third party licenses and potential debt or equity financings constitute forward looking statements and are made under the safe harbor provisions of the section of the securities act of as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these statements are neither promises nor guarantees 
our actual results of operations and financial condition have varied and could in the future vary significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this form k  in the documents incorporated by reference into this form k or presented elsewhere by our management from time to time 
such factors  among others  could have a material adverse effect upon our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our long sales cycle for enterprise wide sales could cause significant variability in our revenue and operating results for any particular period 
in recent quarters  a growing number of our large and medium sized customers have decided to implement our enterprise customer license arrangements on a department or enterprise wide basis 
our long sales cycle for these large scale deployments makes it difficult to predict when these sales will occur  and we may not be able to sustain these sales on a predictable basis 
we have a long sales cycle for these enterprise wide sales because our sales force generally needs to explain and demonstrate the benefits of a large scale deployment of our product to potential and existing customers prior to sale  our service personnel typically spend a significant amount of time assisting potential customers in their testing and evaluation of our products and services  our customers are typically large and medium size organizations that carefully research their technology needs and the many potential projects prior to making capital expenditures for software infrastructure  and before making a purchase  our potential customers usually must get approvals from various levels of decision makers within their organizations  and this process can be lengthy 
the continued long sales cycle for these large scale deployment sales could make it difficult to predict the quarter in which sales will occur 
delays in sales could cause significant variability in our revenue and operating results for any particular period 

table of contents we face intense competition  which could result in fewer customer orders and reduced revenues and margins 
we compete in intensely competitive markets 
some of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  sales and marketing and other resources than we do 
for example  our ability to market the citrix metaframe product line  and its individual products including citrix metaframe presentation server  citrix metaframe secure access manager  citrix metaframe conferencing manager and citrix metaframe password manager  and other future product offerings could be affected by microsoft s licensing and pricing scheme for client devices  servers and applications 
further  the announcement of the release  and the actual release  of new windows based server operating systems or products incorporating similar features to our products could cause our existing and potential customers to postpone or cancel plans to license certain of our existing and future product and service offerings 
in addition  alternative products for secure  remote access in the internet software and hardware markets directly and indirectly compete with our current citrix metaframe product line and our web based desk top access products and services  including gotoassist  gotomypc and gotomeeting and anticipated future product and service offerings 
existing or new products and services that extend internet software and hardware to provide web based information and application access or interactive computing can materially impact our ability to sell our products and services in this market 
our current competitors in this market include microsoft  oracle corporation  sun microsystems  inc  cisco systems  inc  webex communications  inc  symantec corporation  and other makers of secure remote access solutions 
as the markets for our products and services continue to develop  additional companies  including companies with significant market presence in the computer hardware  software and networking industries could enter the markets in which we compete and further intensify competition 
in addition  we believe price competition could become a more significant competitive factor in the future 
as a result  we may not be able to maintain our historic prices and margins  which could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
sales of products within our metaframe product line constitute a substantial majority of our revenue 
we anticipate that sales of products within our metaframe product line and related enhancements will constitute a substantial majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
our ability to continue to generate revenue from our metaframe product line will depend on market acceptance of windows server operating systems and or unix operating systems 
declines in demand for our metaframe products could occur as a result of new competitive product releases and updates to existing products  price competition  technological change  decreasing or stagnant information technology spending levels  general economic conditions  or lack of success of entities with which we have a strategic or technology relationship 
if our customers do not continue to purchase our metaframe products as a result of these or other factors  our revenue would decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 

table of contents if we do not develop new products and services or enhancements to our existing products and services  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the markets for our products and services are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  fluctuations in customer demand  changes in customer requirements  and frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements 
our future success depends on our ability to continually enhance our current products and services and develop and introduce new products and services that our customers choose to buy 
if we are unable to keep pace with technological developments and customer demands by introducing new products and services and enhancements to our existing products and services  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our future success could be hindered by delays in our introduction of new products and services  delays in market acceptance of new products and services or new releases of our current products and services  and our  or a competitor s  announcement of new product or service enhancements or technologies that could replace or shorten the life cycle of our existing product and service offerings 
for example  we cannot guarantee that our access infrastructure software will achieve the broad market acceptance by our channel and entities with which we have a strategic or technology relationship  customers and prospective customers necessary to generate significant revenue 
in addition  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to respond effectively to technological changes or new product announcements by others 
if we experience material delays or sales shortfalls with respect to our new products and services or new releases of our current products and services  those delays or shortfalls could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our business could be adversely impacted by the failure to renew our agreements with microsoft for source code access 
in december  we entered into a five year technology collaboration and licensing agreement with microsoft corporation or microsoft 
the arrangement includes a new technology initiative for closer collaboration on terminal server functionality in future server operating systems  continued access to source code for key components of microsoft s current and future server operating systems  and a patent cross licensing agreement 
this technology collaboration and licensing agreement replaces the agreement we signed with microsoft in may  that provided us access to microsoft windows server source code for current and future microsoft server operating systems  including access to windows server and terminal services source code 
there can be no assurances that our current agreements with microsoft will be extended or renewed by microsoft after their respective expirations 
in addition  microsoft could terminate the current agreements before the expiration of the term for breach or upon a change in our control 
the early termination or the failure to renew certain terms of these agreements with microsoft in a manner favorable to us could negatively impact the timing of our release of future products and enhancements 
our business could be adversely impacted by conditions affecting the information technology market 
the demand for our products and services depends substantially upon the general demand for business related computer hardware and software  which fluctuates based on numerous factors  including capital spending levels  the spending levels and growth of our current and prospective customers and general economic conditions 
fluctuations in the demand for our products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in the past  adverse economic conditions decreased demand for our products and negatively impacted our financial results 

table of contents future economic projections for the it sector are uncertain 
if an uncertain it spending environment persists  it could negatively impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the anticipated benefits to us of acquiring expertcity may not be realized 
we acquired expertcity  now known as citrix online in february  with the expectation that the acquisition would result in various benefits including  among other things  enhanced revenue and profits  greater market presence and development  and enhancements to our product portfolio and customer base 
we expect that the acquisition will enhance our position in the access infrastructure market through the combination of our technologies  products  services  distribution channels and customer contacts with those of citrix online  and will enable us to broaden our customer base to include individuals  professionals and small office home office customers as well as extend our presence in the enterprise access infrastructure market 
we may not fully realize some of these benefits and the acquisition may result in the deterioration or loss of significant business 
for example  if our business or citrix online s business fails to meet the demands of the marketplace  customer acceptance of the products and services of the combined companies could decline  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
costs incurred and potential liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition also could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
achieving the expected benefits of the acquisition will depend in part on the integration of citrix online s and our businesses in a timely and efficient manner 
the challenges involved in this integration include difficulties integrating citrix online s operations  technologies and products as well as coordinating the efforts of citrix online s sales organization with our larger and more widely dispersed sales organization 
although the integration of the two businesses is ongoing  it is still complex  time consuming and expensive  disruptive to our business and may result in the loss of customers or key employees or the diversion of the attention of management which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
acquisitions present many risks  and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals we anticipate at the time of an acquisition 
our growth is dependent upon market growth  our ability to enhance existing products and services  and our ability to introduce new products and services on a timely basis 
we intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and services and enhance existing products and services through acquisitions of other companies  product lines and or technologies 
acquisitions  including those of high technology companies  are inherently risky 
we cannot assure anyone that our previous acquisitions or any future acquisitions will be successful in helping us reach our financial and strategic goals either for that acquisition or for us generally 
the risks we commonly encounter are difficulties integrating the operations  technologies  and products of the acquired companies  undetected errors or unauthorized use of a third party s code in products of the acquired companies  the risk of diverting management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  potential difficulties in completing products associated with purchased in process research and development  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors have stronger market positions  the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company  and an uncertain sales and earnings stream from the acquired company  which could unexpectedly dilute our earnings 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we cannot guarantee that the combined company resulting from any acquisition can continue to support the growth achieved by 
table of contents the companies separately 
we must also focus on our ability to manage and integrate any acquisition 
our failure to manage growth effectively and successfully integrate acquired companies could adversely affect our business and operating results 
if we determine that any of our goodwill or intangible assets  including technology purchased in acquisitions  are impaired  we would be required to take a charge to earnings  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets  such as product and core technology  related to our acquisition of sequoia software corporation in and expertcity and net in we do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite lives 
however  we do amortize certain product and core technologies  trademarks  patents and other intangibles 
we periodically evaluate our intangible assets  including goodwill  for impairment 
as of december  we had million of goodwill 
we review for impairment annually  or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount could exceed fair value 
fair values are based on discounted cash flows using a discount rate determined by our management to be consistent with industry discount rates and the risks inherent in our current business model 
due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy and product portfolio  it is possible that the forecasts we use to support our goodwill could change in the future  which could result in non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
at december   we had million  net  of unamortized identified intangibles with estimable useful lives  of which million consists of core technology we purchased in the acquisition of sequoia  million relates to product and core technology purchased in the expertcity acquisition  million relates to product and core technology purchased in the net acquisition and million represents core technology purchased under third party licenses 
we have commercialized and currently market the sequoia and other licensed technology through our secure access infrastructure software  which includes citrix metaframe secure access manager and citrix metaframe password manager 
we currently market the technologies acquired in the expertcity and net acquisitions through our citrix online and citrix gateway divisions 
however  our channel distributors and entities with which we have technology relationships  customers or prospective customers may not purchase or widely accept our new line of products and services 
if we fail to complete the development of our anticipated future product offerings  if we fail to complete them in a timely manner  or if we are unsuccessful in selling these new products and services  we could determine that the value of the purchased technology is impaired in whole or in part and take a charge to earnings 
we could also incur additional charges in later periods to reflect costs associated with completing those projects that could not be completed in a timely manner 
if the actual revenues and operating profit attributable to acquired product and core technologies are less than the projections we used to initially value product and core technologies when we acquired it  such intangible assets may be deemed to be impaired 
if we determine that any of our intangible assets are impaired  we would be required to take a related charge to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we recorded approximately million of goodwill and intangible assets in connection with our acquisition of expertcity and million of goodwill and intangible assets in connection with our acquisition of net if the actual revenues and operating profit attributable to acquired intangible assets are less than the projections we used to initially value these intangible assets when we acquired them  then these intangible assets may be deemed to be impaired 
if we determine that any of the goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquisitions of expertcity or net are impaired  then we would be required to reduce the value of those assets or to write them off completely by taking a related charge to earnings 
if we are required to write down or write off all or a portion of those assets  or if financial analysts or investors believe we may need to take such action in the future  our stock price and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
if we fail to manage our operations and grow revenue or fail to continue to effectively control expenses  our future operating results could be adversely affected 
historically  the scope of our operations  the number of our employees and the geographic area of our operations and our revenue have grown rapidly 
in addition  we have acquired both domestic and international companies 
this growth and the assimilation of acquired operations and their employees could continue to place a significant strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources 
to manage our growth  if any  effectively  we need to continue to implement and improve additional management and financial systems and controls 
we may not be able to manage the current scope of our operations or future growth effectively and still exploit market opportunities for our products and services in a timely and cost effective way 
our future operating results could also depend on our ability to manage 
table of contents our expanding product line  our marketing and sales organizations  and our client support organization as installations of our products increase 
in addition  to the extent our revenue grows  if at all  we believe that our cost of revenues and certain operating expenses could also increase 
we believe that we could incur additional costs and royalties as we develop  license or buy new technologies or enhancements to our existing products and services 
these added costs and royalties could increase our cost of revenues and operating expenses 
however  we cannot currently quantify the costs for such transactions that have not yet occurred 
in addition  we may need to use a substantial portion of our cash and investments or issue additional shares of our common stock to fund these additional costs 
we attribute most of our growth during recent years to the introduction of the metaframe software for windows operating systems in mid we cannot assure you that the access infrastructure software market  in which we operate  will grow 
we cannot assure you that the release of our access infrastructure software suite of products or other new products will increase our revenue growth rate 
we cannot assure you that our operating expenses will be lower than our estimated or actual revenues in any given quarter 
if we experience a shortfall in revenue in any given quarter  we likely will not be able to further reduce operating expenses quickly in response 
any significant shortfall in revenue could immediately and adversely affect our results of operations for that quarter 
also  due to the fixed nature of many of our expenses and our current expectation for revenue growth  our income from operations and cash flows from operating and investing activities could be lower than in recent years 
we could change our licensing programs  which could negatively impact the timing of our recognition of revenue 
we continually re evaluate our licensing programs  including specific license models  delivery methods  and terms and conditions  to market our current and future products and services 
we could implement different licensing models in certain circumstances  for which we would recognize licensing fees over a longer period 
changes to our licensing programs  including the timing of the release of enhancements  discounts and other factors  could impact the timing of the recognition of revenue for our products  related enhancements and services and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
as our international sales and operations grow  we could become increasingly subject to additional risks that could harm our business 
we conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries outside of the united states 
during  we derived approximately of our revenues from sales outside the united states 
our continued growth and profitability could require us to further expand our international operations 
to successfully expand international sales  we must establish additional foreign operations  hire additional personnel and recruit additional international resellers 
our international operations are subject to a variety of risks  which could cause fluctuations in the results of our international operations 
these risks include compliance with foreign regulatory and market requirements  variability of foreign economic  political and labor conditions  changing restrictions imposed by regulatory requirements  tariffs or other trade barriers or by united states export laws  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  potentially adverse tax consequences  difficulties in protecting intellectual property  and 
table of contents burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
as we generate cash flow in non us jurisdictions  if necessary  we may experience difficulty transferring such funds to the us in a tax efficient manner 
our results of operations are also subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to minimize the impacts on our operating results  we generally initiate our hedging of currency exchange risks one year in advance of anticipated foreign currency expenses 
as a result of this practice  foreign currency denominated expenses will be higher or lower in the current year depending on the weakness or strength of the dollar in the prior year 
there is a risk that there will be fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates beyond the one year timeframe for which we hedge our risk 
because the dollar was generally weak in  operating expenses are higher in  but further dollar weakness in will not have an additional material impact on our operating expenses until our success depends  in part  on our ability to anticipate and address these risks 
we cannot guarantee that these or other factors will not adversely affect our business or operating results 
our proprietary rights could offer only limited protection 
our products could infringe third party intellectual property rights  which could result in material costs 
our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not be successful 
we rely primarily on a combination of copyright  trademark  patent and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions  to protect our proprietary rights 
the loss of any material trade secret  trademark  trade name  patent or copyright could have a material adverse effect on our business 
despite our precautions  it could be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy or reverse engineer certain portions of our products or to otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information 
if we cannot protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use  we may not remain competitive 
any patents owned by us could be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
any of our pending or future patent applications  whether or not being currently challenged  may not be issued with the scope we seek  if at all  and if issued  may not provide any meaningful protection or competitive advantage 
in addition  our ability to protect our proprietary rights could be affected by differences in international law  enforceability of licenses 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and canada 
for example  we derive a significant portion of our sales from licensing our packaged products under shrink wrap or click to accept license agreements that are not signed by licensees and electronic enterprise customer licensing arrangements that are delivered electronically  all of which could be unenforceable under the laws of many foreign jurisdictions in which we license our products 
third party infringement claims 
as we expand our product lines  the number of products and competitors in our industry segments increase and the functionality of these products overlap  we could become increasingly subject to infringement claims and claims to the unauthorized use of a third party s code in our products 
companies and inventors are more frequently seeking to patent software and business methods because of developments in the law that could extend the ability to obtain such patents 
as a result  we could receive more patent infringement claims 
responding to any infringement claim  regardless of its validity  could result in costly litigation  injunctive relief or require us to obtain a license to intellectual property rights of those third parties 
licenses may not be available on reasonable terms  on terms compatible with the protection of our proprietary rights  or at all 
in addition  attention to these claims could divert our management s time and attention from developing our business 
if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology  our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
we are subject to risks associated with our strategic and technology relationships 
our business depends on strategic and technology relationships 
we cannot assure you that those relationships will continue in the future 
in addition to our relationship with microsoft  we rely on strategic or technology relationships with such companies as sap  international business machines corporation  hewlett packard company  dell inc and others 
we depend on the entities with which we have strategic or technology relationships to successfully test our products  to 
table of contents incorporate our technology into their products and to market and sell those products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current strategic and technology relationships or to develop additional strategic and technology relationships 
if any entities in which we have a strategic or technology relationship are unable to incorporate our technology into their products or to market or sell those products  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
if we lose access to third party licenses  releases of our products could be delayed 
we believe that we will continue to rely  in part  on third party licenses to enhance and differentiate our products 
third party licensing arrangements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including undetected errors or unauthorized use of another person s code in the third party s software  disagreement over the scope of the license and other key terms  such as royalties payable  and infringement actions brought by third party licensees  termination or expiration of the license 
if we lose or are unable to maintain any of these third party licenses or are required to modify software obtained under third party licenses  it could delay the release of our products 
any delays could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the market for our web based training and customer assistance products is volatile  and if it does not develop or develops more slowly than we expect  our citrix online division will be harmed 
the market for our web based training and customer assistance products is new and unproven  and it is uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance 
our success with our citrix online division will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of enterprises  large and small  to increase their use of application services in general and for gotomypc  gotomeeting and gotoassist  in particular 
many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses  and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to application services 
furthermore  some enterprises may be reluctant or unwilling to use application services because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with security capabilities  among other things  of the technology delivery model associated with these services 
if enterprises do not perceive the benefits of application services  then the market for these services may not further develop at all  or it may develop more slowly than we expect  either of which would significantly adversely affect our financial condition and the operating results for our citrix online division 
our success depends on our ability to attract and retain and further penetrate large enterprise customers 
we must retain and continue to expand our ability to reach and penetrate large enterprise customers by adding effective channel distributors and expanding our consulting services 
our inability to attract and retain large enterprise customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
large enterprise customers usually request special pricing and generally have longer sales cycles  which could negatively impact our revenues 
by granting special pricing  such as bundled pricing or discounts  to these large customers  we may have to defer recognition of some portion of the revenue from such sales 
this deferral could reduce our revenues and operating profits for a given reporting period 
additionally  as we attempt to attract and penetrate large enterprise customers  we may need to increase corporate branding and marketing activities  which could increase our operating expenses 
these efforts may not proportionally increase our operating revenues and could reduce our profits 
our success may depend on our ability to attract and retain small sized customers 
in order to successfully attract new customer segments to our metaframe products and expand our existing relationships with enterprise customers  we must reach and retain small sized customers and small project initiatives within our larger enterprise customers 
we have begun a marketing initiative to reach these customers that includes extending our advisor rewards program to include a broader range of license types 
we cannot guarantee that our small sized customer marketing 
table of contents initiative will be successful 
our failure to attract and retain small sized customers and small project initiatives within our larger enterprise customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  as we attempt to attract and retain small sized customers and small project initiatives within our larger enterprise customers  we may need to increase corporate branding and broaden our marketing activities  which could increase our operating expenses 
these efforts may not proportionally increase our operating revenues and could reduce our profits 
our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to expand and diversify our distribution channels 
we currently intend to continue to expand our distribution channels by leveraging our relationships with independent hardware and software vendors and system integrators to encourage them to recommend or distribute our products 
in addition  an integral part of our strategy is to diversify our base of channel relationships by adding more channel members with abilities to reach larger enterprise customers 
this will require additional resources  as we will need to expand our internal sales and service coverage of these customers 
if we fail in these efforts and cannot expand or diversify our distribution channels  our business could be adversely affected 
in addition to this diversification of our base  we will need to maintain a healthy mix of channel members who cater to smaller customers 
we may need to add and remove distribution members to maintain customer satisfaction and a steady adoption rate of our products  which could increase our operating expenses 
through our accesspartner network  citrix authorized learning centers and other programs  we are currently investing  and intend to continue to invest  significant resources to develop these channels  which could reduce our profits 
we rely on indirect distribution channels and major distributors that we do not control 
we rely significantly on independent distributors and resellers to market and distribute our products 
we do not control our distributors and resellers 
additionally  our distributors and resellers are not obligated to buy our products and could also represent other lines of products 
some of our distributors and resellers maintain inventories of our packaged products for resale to smaller end users 
if distributors and resellers reduce their inventory of our packaged products  our business could be adversely affected 
further  we could maintain individually significant accounts receivable balances with certain distributors 
the financial condition of our distributors could deteriorate and distributors could significantly delay or default on their payment obligations 
any significant delays or defaults could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our products could contain errors that could delay the release of new products and may not be detected until after our products are shipped 
despite significant testing by us and by current and potential customers  our products  especially new products or releases  could contain errors 
in some cases  these errors may not be discovered until after commercial shipments have been made 
errors in our products could delay the development or release of new products and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products 
additionally  our products depend on third party products  which could contain defects and could reduce the performance of our products or render them useless 
because our products are often used in mission critical applications  errors in our products or the products of third parties upon which our products rely could give rise to warranty or other claims by our customers 
our synthetic lease is an off balance sheet arrangement that could negatively affect our financial condition and results 
in april  we entered into a seven year synthetic lease with a lessor for our headquarters office buildings in fort lauderdale  florida 
the synthetic lease qualifies for operating lease accounting treatment under sfas no 
 accounting for leases  so we do not include the property or the associated lease debt on our consolidated balance sheet 
in december  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities revised  which was effective immediately for certain disclosure requirements and variable interest entities referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december  and for other types of entities for financial statements for periods ending after march  we have determined that we were not required to consolidate the lessor entity  the leased facility or the related debt upon adopting of fin no 
revised 
accordingly  there was no impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows from adoption 
however  if the lessor were to change its ownership of our property or significantly change its ownership of other properties that it currently holds  we could be required to consolidate the entity  the leased facility and the debt at that time 

table of contents if we elect not to purchase the property at the end of the lease term  we have guaranteed a minimum residual value of approximately million to the lessor 
therefore  if the fair value of the property declines below million  our residual value guarantee would require us to pay the difference to the lessor  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our citrix online division customers data  our services may be perceived as not being secure and customers may curtail or stop using our service 
use of our gotomypc  gotomeeting or gotoassist services involves the storage and transmission of customers proprietary information  and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information  litigation and possible liability 
if our security measures are breached as a result of third party action  employee error  malfeasance or otherwise  and  as a result  someone obtains unauthorized access to one of our online customers data  our reputation will be damaged  our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability 
because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 
if any compromises of security were to occur  it could have the effect of substantially reducing the use of the web for commerce and communications 
anyone who circumvents our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services or operations 
the internet is a public network  and data is sent over this network from many sources 
in the past  computer viruses  software programs that disable or impair computers  have been distributed and have rapidly spread over the internet 
computer viruses could be introduced into our systems or those of our customers or suppliers  which could disrupt our network or make it inaccessible to our citrix online division customers 
if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs  the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and customers for our citrix online division  which would significantly adversely affect our financial condition and the operating results for our citrix online division 
evolving regulation of the web may adversely affect our citrix online division 
as web commerce continues to evolve  increasing regulation by federal  state or foreign agencies becomes more likely 
for example  we believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy  and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation  collection  processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our online customers ability to use and share data and restricting our ability to store  process and share data with these customers 
in addition  taxation of services provided over the web or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the web may also be imposed 
any regulation imposing greater fees for web use or restricting information exchange over the web could result in a decline in the use of the web and the viability of web based services  which would significantly adversely affect our financial condition and the operating results for our citrix online division 
if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future  we may not be able to fund our operations and fulfill our future obligations 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our operations and product development  including the payment of cash consideration in acquisitions and the payment of our other obligations  depends on a range of economic  competitive and business factors  many of which are outside our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  or that we will be able to liquidate our investments  repatriate cash and investments held in our overseas subsidiaries  sell assets or raise equity or debt financings when needed or desirable 
an inability to fund our operations or fulfill outstanding obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for further information  please refer to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
if we lose key personnel or cannot hire enough qualified employees  our ability to manage our business could be adversely affected 
our success depends  in large part  upon the services of a number of key employees 
except for certain key employees of acquired businesses  we do not have long term employment agreements with any of our key personnel 
any officer or employee can terminate his or her relationship with us at any time 
the effective management of our growth  if any  could depend upon our ability to retain our highly skilled technical  managerial  finance and marketing personnel 
if any of those employees leave  we will need to attract and retain replacements for them 
we also need to add key personnel in the future 

table of contents the market for these qualified employees is competitive 
we could find it difficult to successfully attract  assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel in sufficient numbers 
furthermore  we may hire key personnel in connection with our future acquisitions  however  any of these employees will be able to terminate his or her relationship with us at any time 
if we cannot retain and add the necessary staff and resources for these acquired businesses  our ability to develop acquired products  markets and customers could be adversely affected 
also  we may need to hire additional personnel to develop new products  product enhancements and technologies 
if we cannot add the necessary staff and resources  our ability to develop future enhancements and features to our existing or future products could be delayed 
any delays could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
failure to obtain approval from our shareholders of new stock plans could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees 
several of our stock plans terminate in accordingly  our board of directors has recommend to our shareholders the approval of new stock plans for the issuance of stock options and other forms of equity based compensation to our employees  officers and directors 
we may not be able to secure approval for these new stock plans from our shareholders 
if we do not get such approvals  we will be forced to curtail our stock option issuances  which will adversely impact our ability to retain existing employees and attract qualified candidates 
if stock balancing returns or price adjustments exceed our reserves  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we provide most of our distributors with stock balancing return rights  which generally permit our distributors to return products to us by the forty fifth day of a fiscal quarter  subject to ordering an equal dollar amount of our products prior to the last day of the same fiscal quarter 
we also provide price protection rights to most of our distributors 
price protection rights require that we grant retroactive price adjustments for inventories of our products held by distributors if we lower our prices for those products within a specified time period 
to cover our exposure to these product returns and price adjustments  we establish reserves based on our evaluation of historical product trends and current marketing plans 
however  we cannot assure you that our reserves will be sufficient to cover our future product returns and price adjustments 
if we inadequately forecast reserves  our operating results could be adversely affected 
our stock price could be volatile  and you could lose the value of your investment 
our stock price has been volatile and has fluctuated significantly to date 
the trading price of our stock is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
your investment in our stock could lose value 
some of the factors that could significantly affect the market price of our stock include actual or anticipated variations in operating and financial results  analyst reports or recommendations  changes in interest rates  and other events or factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the stock market in general  the nasdaq national market and the market for software companies and technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these broad market and industry factors could materially and adversely affect the market price of our stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
our business and investments could be adversely impacted by unfavorable economic political and social conditions 
general economic and market conditions  and other factors outside our control including terrorist and military actions  could adversely affect our business and impair the value of our investments 
any further downturn in general economic conditions could result in a reduction in demand for our products and services and could harm our business 
these conditions make it difficult for us  and our customers  to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  an economic downturn could result in an impairment in the value of our investments requiring us to record losses related to such investments 
impairment in the value of these investments may disrupt our ongoing business and distract management 
as 
table of contents of december   we had million of short and long term investments  including restricted investments  with various issuers and financial institutions 
in many cases we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these investments and could incur losses related to the impairment of these investments 
fluctuations in economic and market conditions could adversely affect the value of our investments  and we could lose some of our investment portfolio 
a total loss of an investment could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
for further information on these investments  please refer to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the analysis methods we used to assess and mitigate risk discussed below should not be considered projections of future events  gains or losses 
we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
to mitigate foreign currency and interest rate risk  we utilize derivative financial instruments 
the counter parties to our derivative instruments are major financial institutions 
all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of december  actual results could differ materially 
discussions of our accounting policies for derivatives and hedging activities are included in notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
exposure to exchange rates a substantial majority of our overseas expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in local currencies  including euros  british pounds sterling  swiss francs  australian dollars and japanese yen 
to reduce exposure to reduction in us dollar value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates  we have established a hedging program 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency expenditures 
our hedging program significantly reduces  but does not entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements 
at december  and  we had in place foreign currency forward sale contracts with a notional amount of million and million  respectively  and foreign currency forward purchase contracts with a notional amount of million and million  respectively 
at december  and  these contracts had an aggregate fair value of million and million  respectively 
based on a hypothetical appreciation of the us dollar from december  market rates the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts would decrease by million 
conversely  a hypothetical depreciation of the us dollar from december  market rates would increase the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts by million 
foreign operating costs in these hypothetical movements would move in the opposite direction 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates quantified above  changes in exchange rates could also change the dollar value of sales and affect the volume of sales as competitors products become more or less attractive 
we do not anticipate any material adverse impact to our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows as a result of these forward foreign exchange contracts 
exposure to interest rates we have interest rate exposures resulting from our interest based available for sale securities 
in order to better manage our exposure to interest rate risk  we are a party to interest rate swap agreements 
the swap agreements  with an aggregate notional amount of million convert the fixed rate return on certain of our available for sale securities  to a floating rate 
the aggregate fair value of the interest rate swaps at december  was an asset of million 
based upon a hypothetical increase in the market interest rate as of december   the fair value of these aggregated assets would have increased by approximately million 
based on a hypothetical decrease in the market interest rate as of december   the fair value of these aggregated liabilities would have increased by approximately million 
the underlying assets would experience offsetting gains and losses 
we also maintain available for sale and held to maturity investments in debt securities  which limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer  or type of instrument 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged 
the securities classified as available for sale are subject to interest rate risk 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes that ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest and reinvestment income 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points from december  and levels  the fair value of the available for sale portfolio would decline by approximately million and million  respectively 
this sensitivity analysis on our available for sale portfolio excludes the underlying investments to our interest rate swaps 
table of contents discussed above  as the interest rate risk related to those investments has been effectively hedged 
for more information see note to our consolidated financial statements 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate movements on our interest rate swap agreements and available for sale and held to maturity investment portfolios 
this analysis does not consider the effect of credit risk as a result of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
in april  we entered into a synthetic lease with a substantive lessor totaling approximately million related to office space utilized for our corporate headquarters 
payments under this synthetic lease are indexed to a variable interest rate libor plus a margin 
based upon our interest rate exposure under this synthetic lease at december   a basis point change in the current interest rate would have an immaterial effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in addition to interest rate exposure  if the fair value of our headquarters building in fort lauderdale  florida were to significantly decline  there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition
