fiscal performance priorities 
one of the performance priorities of the company in fiscal is to regain a premium return on equity as compared with its competitors by focusing on areas of business with strong potential for growth and leveraging the strengths and capabilities of the company s business segments 
each of the company s businesses segments will also focus on key initiatives in fiscal institutional securities will continue to focus on enhancing client relationships  maintaining or improving market share and increasing profitability through investing in growth markets and improving capital and risk efficiency

one of the group s top priorities is margin improvement over the next two years 
investment management s primary objective will be to improve operating leverage through revenue growth 
investment management will focus on building key growth areas where it is currently underrepresented  including separately managed accounts  multi discipline accounts and alternative investment products  capturing logo 
table of contents more flows  primarily as a result of improved fund performance and standings  and continuing to concentrate assets under the best performing managers 
in fiscal  investment management may experience slower growth in fee revenues due to fee reductions across certain products and because a large percentage of product sales in fiscal were in institutional fixed income and liquidity fund products  which generally generate lower fees than equity products 
in addition  lower principal investment gains are expected going forward as the company reduces its private equity business 
credit services will continue to focus on growing both profitability and customer receivable balances and creating a competitive advantage with its proprietary network 
the company believes there is potential to capitalize on the recent us supreme court decision  rejecting an appeal by visa and mastercard in us v 
visa mastercard  which allows financial institutions to issue credit and debit cards on the discover network 
in january  the company announced that it had signed its first third party issuance with ge consumer finance to issue the wal mart discover card on the discover network

at the end of fiscal  the backlog of equity and fixed income underwriting transactions was higher as compared with the end of the prior fiscal year  generally reflecting improved global market and economic conditions 
although the merger  acquisition and restructuring transactions backlog was slightly lower at the end of fiscal as compared with the end of fiscal  the calendar year over year comparison improved during the month of december  as a result of the company s role advising on a number of significant transactions announced during the month

the company incurs interest expense at fixed and floating rates 
interest expense also includes the effects of any interest rate contracts entered into by the company as part of its interest rate risk management program 
this program is designed to reduce the volatility of earnings resulting from changes in interest rates by having a financing portfolio that reflects the existing repricing schedules of consumer loans as well as the company s right  with notice to cardmembers  to reprice certain fixed rate consumer loans to a new interest rate in the future

provision for consumer loan losses 
the provision for consumer loan losses is the amount necessary to establish the allowance for consumer loan losses at a level that the company believes is adequate to absorb estimated losses in its consumer loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
the allowance for consumer loan losses is a significant estimate that represents management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the consumer loan portfolio 
the allowance for consumer loan losses is primarily applicable to the owned homogeneous consumer credit card loan portfolio that is evaluated quarterly for adequacy and is established through a charge to the provision for consumer loan losses 
in calculating the allowance for consumer loan losses  the company uses a systematic and consistently applied approach 
the company regularly performs a migration analysis a technique used to estimate the likelihood that a consumer loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately charge off of delinquent and current consumer credit card accounts in order to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for consumer loan losses 
the migration analysis considers uncollectible principal  interest and fees reflected in consumer loans 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for consumer loan losses  management also considers factors that may impact future credit loss experience  including current economic conditions  recent trends in delinquencies and bankruptcy filings  account collection management  policy changes  account seasoning  loan volume and amounts  payment rates and forecasting uncertainties 
the company s provision for consumer loan losses was million and  million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the company s allowance for consumer loan losses was million at november  and  million at november  the provision for consumer loan losses decreased in fiscal  primarily due to lower net principal charge offs resulting from an improvement in credit quality  including lower bankruptcy charge offs driven by a decline in us personal bankruptcy filings 
the decrease was also due to a lower level of average general purpose credit card loans 
the company reduced the allowance for consumer loan losses by approximately logo 
table of contents million in fiscal due to improvement in credit quality  including lower delinquency rates and dollars 
in fiscal  the provision for consumer loan losses decreased  primarily due to a lower level of average general purpose credit card loans 
in response to unfavorable trends in us consumer bankruptcy filings and relatively high unemployment levels  the company recorded a provision for consumer loan losses that exceeded the amount of net consumer loans charged off by approximately million in fiscal delinquencies and charge offs 
general purpose credit card loans are considered delinquent when interest or principal payments become days past due 
general purpose credit card loans are charged off at the end of the month during which an account becomes days past due  except in the case of bankruptcies  deceased cardmembers and fraudulent transactions  where loans are charged off earlier 
loan delinquencies and charge offs are affected by changes in economic conditions  account collection management and policy changes and may vary throughout the year due to seasonal consumer spending and payment behaviors 
in fiscal  net principal charge off rates decreased in both the owned and managed portfolios as compared with fiscal  reflecting improvements in portfolio credit quality and a lower level of bankruptcy filings see managed general purpose credit card loan data herein 
delinquency rates in both the over and over day categories were lower in both the owned and managed portfolios at november  as compared with november   also reflecting improvements in portfolio credit quality 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company changed its policy related to deceased cardmember accounts to charge off days after notification as compared with charging off days past due 
this change accelerated charge offs beginning in the third quarter of fiscal and increased charge offs in the second half of fiscal during the second half of fiscal and the first half of fiscal  the company changed its re age policy in response to industry wide regulatory guidelines 
a re age is intended to assist delinquent cardmembers who have experienced financial difficulties by returning the account to current status 
this change in the re age policy  along with the economic challenges as evidenced by high levels of unemployment and us bankruptcy filings  resulted in a significant decrease in the number of cardmembers eligible for re age vs 
comparable periods in fiscal during fiscal  the company s re age volume decreased by approximately from fiscal the reduction in re age volume was a contributing factor to the higher delinquencies and charge off levels experienced in fiscal as compared with fiscal in fiscal  net principal charge off rates increased in the managed portfolio as compared with fiscal  reflecting the impact of lower re age volume and the change in the company s deceased cardmember policy discussed above see managed general purpose credit card loan data herein 
in the us  high levels of unemployment  the seasoning of the company s general purpose credit card loan portfolio  a high level of bankruptcy filings and policy changes contributed to the higher net principal charge off rate in the managed portfolio during fiscal in addition  these conditions impacted the company s delinquency rates in both the over and over day categories  which were higher in both the owned and managed portfolio at november  as compared with november  a lower level of general purpose credit card loan balances also negatively impacted delinquency and net principal charge off rates in fiscal the company s future charge off rates and credit quality are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what has been discussed above 
factors that influence the provision for consumer loan losses include the level and direction of general purpose credit card loan delinquencies and charge offs  changes in consumer spending and payment behaviors  bankruptcy trends  the seasoning of the company s general purpose credit card loan portfolio  interest rate movements and their impact on consumer behavior  and the rate and magnitude of changes in the company s general purpose credit card loan portfolio  including the overall mix of accounts  products and loan balances within the portfolio

seasonal factors 
the credit card lending activities of credit services are affected by seasonal patterns of retail purchasing 
historically  a substantial percentage of general purpose credit card loan growth occurs in the fourth calendar quarter  followed by a flattening or decline of these loans in the following calendar quarter 
merchant fees  therefore  historically have tended to increase in the first fiscal quarter  reflecting higher sales activity in the month of december 
additionally  higher cardmember rewards incentives historically have been accrued for as a reduction of merchant and cardmember fee revenues in the first fiscal quarter  reflecting seasonal growth in retail sales volume 
managed general purpose credit card loan data 
the company analyzes its financial performance on both a managed loan basis and as reported under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap owned loan basis 
managed loan data assume that the company s securitized loan receivables have not been sold and present the results of the securitized loan receivables in the same manner as the company s owned loans 
the company operates its credit services business and analyzes its financial performance on a managed basis 
accordingly  underwriting and servicing standards are comparable for both owned and securitized loans 
the company believes that managed loan information is useful to investors because it provides information regarding the quality of loan origination and credit performance of the entire managed portfolio and allows investors to understand the related credit risks inherent in owned loans and retained interests in securitizations 
in addition  investors often request information on a managed basis  which provides a more meaningful comparison with industry competitors

in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company changed its method of accounting for such fees to properly recognize such fees and related expenses over the relevant contract period  generally quarterly or annually 
as a result of the change  the company s results in the fourth quarter of fiscal included an adjustment to reflect the cumulative impact of the deferral of certain management fees  account fees and related compensation expense paid to representatives 
the impact of this change reduced net revenues by million  non interest expenses by million and income before taxes by million  at both the company and the individual investor group segment in the fourth quarter of fiscal such adjustment reduced net income by approximately million and basic and diluted earnings per share by 
if the above referenced fees and expenses had been recognized over the relevant contract period in the past  pre tax income for the company and the individual investor group segment would have been lower by the following amounts decrease in pre tax income dollars in millions quarter ended february  may  august  november  fiscal total february  may  august  november  fiscal total february  may  august  investments in unconsolidated investees

the company accounts for these investments under the equity method of accounting 
the company s share of the operating logo 
table of contents losses generated by these investments is recorded within losses from unconsolidated investees  and the tax credits and the tax benefits associated with these operating losses are recorded within the company s provision for income taxes 
in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  the losses from unconsolidated investees were more than offset by the respective tax credits and tax benefits on the losses 
the table below provides information regarding the losses from unconsolidated investees  tax credits and tax benefits on the losses fiscal year dollars in millions losses from unconsolidated investees tax credits tax benefits on losses irs field auditors are contesting the placed in service date of several synthetic fuel facilities owned by one of the company s unconsolidated investees the llc 
to qualify for the tax credits under section of the internal revenue code  the production facility must have been placed in service before july  the llc is vigorously contesting the irs proposed position 
if the irs ultimately prevails  it could have an adverse effect on the company s tax liability or results of operations 
the company has recognized cumulative tax credits of approximately million associated with the llc s synthetic fuel facilities 
pension plans 
the company made contributions of million and million to its defined benefit pension plans us and us in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these contributions were funded with cash from operations and were recorded as a component of prepaid pension benefit cost in the company s consolidated statements of financial condition 
in addition  the company  in consultation with its independent actuaries  lowered its expected long term rate of return on us plan assets from to for fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the impact of this change was not material to the company s consolidated results of operations in fiscal the company determines the amount of its pension contributions by considering the interaction of several factors 
such factors include the range of potential contributions ie  the employee retirement income security act of erisa minimum required contribution up to the maximum tax deductible amount  the level of plan assets relative to plan liabilities  expected plan liquidity needs and expected future contribution requirements 
at november   there were no minimum required erisa contributions for the company s pension plan that is qualified under section a of the internal revenue code the qualified plan 
for its non us plans  the company s policy is to fund at least the amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements under applicable employee benefit and tax regulations 
liabilities for benefits payable under its unfunded supplementary plans the supplemental plans are accrued by the company and are funded when paid to the beneficiaries 
in accordance with us gaap  the company recognizes pension expense before the payment of benefits to retirees occurs 
this process involves making certain estimates and assumptions  including the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the assumed discount rate  which reflects the rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled  is used to measure the projected and accumulated benefit obligations and to calculate the service cost and interest cost 
the assumed discount rate reflects the rates of return on available high quality fixed income investments that reflect the timing and amount of expected benefit payments 
for its qualified plan  which comprised approximately of the total assets of the company s pension plans at november   the company logo 
table of contents estimates its discount rate based on both the absolute levels of and year to year changes in various high quality bond indices  including the moody s aa long term rate bond yield 
the company uses the expected long term rate of return on plan assets to compute the expected return on assets 
for its qualified plan  the company annually reviews the expected long term return based on changes in the target investment mix and economic environment from the previous year 
it then compares its initial estimate and adjusts  if necessary with a portfolio return calculator model the portfolio model that produces a range of expected returns for the portfolio 
return assumptions are forward looking gross returns that are not developed solely by an examination of historical returns 
the portfolio model begins with the current us treasury yield curve  recognizing that expected returns on bonds are heavily influenced by the current level of yields 
corporate bond spreads and equity risk premiums  based on current market conditions  are then added to develop the return expectations for each asset class 
expenses that are expected to be paid from the investment return are reflected in the portfolio model as a percentage of plan assets 
this includes investment and transaction fees that typically are paid from plan assets  added to the cost basis or subtracted from sale proceeds  as well as administrative expenses paid from the qualified plan 
the company s expected long term rate of return on assets for its qualified plan for fiscal was based on the following expected asset allocation target investment mix expected annual return domestic equity large capitalization small capitalization international equity fixed income intermediate government corporate long term government corporate these amounts do not include the impact of diversification on the overall expected portfolio return 
for its qualified plan  expected returns are computed using a market related value of assets 
for the market related value of assets  a smoothed actuarial value of assets is used  equal to a moving average of market values in which investment income is recognized over a five year period 
investment income equal to the expected return on the prior year s market related value of plan assets is recognized immediately 
any difference between the actual investment income on a market value basis and the expected return is recognized over a five year period in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
in addition  the market related value of assets must be no greater than and no less than of the market value of assets 
the company amortizes as a component of pension expense unrecognized net gains and losses over the average future service generally to years of active participants in each plan to the extent that the gain loss exceeds of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets 
the loss amortization component of fiscal pension expense was approximately million  and future amortization is not expected to have a material impact on the company s pension expense 
insurance recovery 
on september   the u 
s experienced terrorist attacks targeted against new york city and washington  dc the attacks in new york resulted in the destruction of the world trade center complex  where approximately  of the company s employees were located  and the temporary closing of the debt and equity financial markets in the us through the implementation of its business recovery plans  the company relocated its displaced employees to other facilities 
logo 
table of contents the company has recognized costs related to the terrorist attacks pertaining to write offs of leasehold improvements and destroyed technology and telecommunications equipment in the world trade center complex  employee relocation and certain other employee related expenditures  and other business recovery costs 
the costs were offset by estimated insurance recoveries 
the company continues to be in negotiations with its insurance carriers related to the events of september  at the conclusion of these negotiations  the company currently believes that the amounts it will recover under its insurance policies will be in excess of costs recognized for accounting purposes related to the terrorist attacks 
as of november   the company had not recorded a gain for the anticipated excess recovery 
internal control over financial reporting 
sox requires that the company make an assertion as to the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting beginning with its fiscal annual report on form k 
the company s independent registered public accounting firm must attest to management s assertion 
in order to make its assertion  the company was required to identify material financial and operational processes  document internal controls supporting the financial reporting process and evaluate the design and effectiveness of these controls 
see management s report on internal control over financial reporting and report of independent registered public accounting firm in part i  item a 
the company began preparing for its sox initiative prior to fiscal the company formed a project management office to facilitate ongoing internal control reviews  coordinate the process for these reviews  provide direction to the business and control groups involved in the initiative and assist in the assessment of internal control over financial reporting 
the company also formed a steering committee  comprised of senior personnel from its control groups  to set uniform guiding principles and policies  review the progress of the initiative  direct the efforts of the project management office and update the audit committee of the board of directors on an ongoing basis 
the company also retained an accounting firm other than its independent registered public accounting firm to assist in its compliance with sox the sox effort involved many of the company s employees around the world  including participation by the business areas and control groups 
the company viewed this evaluation of its internal control over financial reporting as more than a regulatory exercise it was an opportunity to assess critically the financial control environment and make it even stronger 
the company incurred initial costs associated with its sox initiative in fiscal and expects to incur costs in the future  particularly as it coordinates the sox evaluation with other regulatory requirements to review and evaluate the control environment

table of contents critical accounting policies 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies see note to the consolidated financial statements  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
fair value 
financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold  not yet purchased  which include cash and derivative products  are recorded at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial condition  and gains and losses are reflected in principal trading revenues in the consolidated statements of income 
fair value is the amount at which financial instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties  other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
the fair value of the company s financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold  not yet purchased are generally based on observable market prices  observable market parameters or derived from such prices or parameters based on bid prices or parameters for financial instruments owned and ask prices or parameters for financial instruments sold  not yet purchased 
in the case of financial instruments transacted on recognized exchanges  the observable prices represent quotations for completed transactions from the exchange on which the financial instrument is principally traded 
bid prices represent the highest price a buyer is willing to pay for a financial instrument at a particular time 
ask prices represent the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for a financial instrument at a particular time 
a substantial percentage of the fair value of the company s financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold  not yet purchased is based on observable market prices  observable market parameters  or is derived from such prices or parameters 
the availability of observable market prices and pricing parameters can vary from product to product 
where available  observable market prices and pricing parameters in a product or a related product may be used to derive a price without requiring significant judgment 
in certain markets  observable market prices or market parameters are not available for all products  and fair value is determined using techniques appropriate for each particular product 
these techniques involve some degree of judgment 
the price transparency of the particular product will determine the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of the company s financial instruments 
price transparency is affected by a wide variety of factors  including  for example  the type of product  whether it is a new product and not yet established in the marketplace  and the characteristics particular to the transaction 
products for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available or for which fair value is derived from actively quoted prices or pricing parameters will generally have a higher degree of price transparency 
by contrast  products that are thinly traded or not quoted will generally have reduced to no price transparency 
even in normally active markets  the price transparency for actively quoted instruments may be reduced for periods of time during periods of market dislocation 
alternatively  in thinly quoted markets  the participation of market makers willing to purchase and sell a product provides a source of transparency for products that otherwise are not actively quoted or during periods of market dislocation 
the company s cash products include securities issued by the us government and its agencies and instrumentalities  other sovereign debt obligations  corporate and other debt securities  corporate equity securities  exchange traded funds and physical commodities 
the fair value of these products is based principally on observable market prices or is derived using observable market parameters 
these products generally do not entail a significant degree of judgment in determining fair value 
examples of products for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available or for which fair value is derived from actively quoted prices or pricing parameters include securities issued by the us government and its agencies and instrumentalities  exchange traded corporate equity securities  most municipal debt securities  most corporate debt securities  most high yield debt securities  physical commodities  certain tradable loan products and most mortgage backed securities 
in certain circumstances  principally involving loan products and other financial instruments held for securitization transactions  the company determines fair value from within the range of bid and ask prices such logo 
table of contents that fair value indicates the value likely to be realized in a current market transaction 
bid prices reflect the price that the company and others pay  or stand ready to pay  to originators of such assets 
ask prices represent the prices that the company and others require to sell such assets to the entities that acquire the financial instruments for purposes of completing the securitization transactions 
generally  the fair value of such acquired assets is based upon the bid price in the market for the instrument or similar instruments 
in general  the loans and similar assets are valued at bid pricing levels until structuring of the related securitization is substantially complete and such that the value likely to be realized in a current transaction is consistent with the price that a securitization entity will pay to acquire the financial instruments 
factors affecting securitized value and investor demand relating specifically to loan products include  but are not limited to  loan type  underlying property type and geographic location  loan interest rate  loan to value ratios  debt service coverage ratio  investor demand and credit enhancement levels 
in addition  some cash products exhibit little or no price transparency  and the determination of the fair value requires more judgment 
examples of cash products with little or no price transparency include certain high yield debt  certain collateralized mortgage obligations  certain tradable loan products  distressed debt securities ie  securities of issuers encountering financial difficulties  including bankruptcy or insolvency and equity securities that are not publicly traded 
generally  the fair value of these types of cash products is determined using one of several valuation techniques appropriate for the product  which can include cash flow analysis  revenue or net income analysis  default recovery analysis ie  analysis of the likelihood of default and the potential for recovery and other analyses applied consistently 
the following table presents the valuation of the company s cash products by level of price transparency dollars in millions at november  at november  assets liabilities assets liabilities observable market prices  parameters or derived from observable prices or parameters reduced or no price transparency total the company s derivative products include exchange traded and otc derivatives 
exchange traded derivatives have valuation attributes similar to the cash products valued using observable market prices or market parameters described above 
otc derivatives  whose fair value is derived using pricing models  include a wide variety of instruments  such as interest rate swap and option contracts  foreign currency option contracts  credit and equity swap and option contracts  and commodity swap and option contracts 
the following table presents the fair value of the company s exchange traded and otc derivative assets and liabilities dollars in millions at november  at november  assets liabilities assets liabilities exchange traded otc total the fair value of otc derivative contracts is derived primarily using pricing models  which may require multiple market input parameters 
where appropriate  valuation adjustments are made to account for credit quality and market liquidity 
these adjustments are applied on a consistent basis and are based upon observable market data where available 
in the absence of observable market prices or parameters in an active market  observable prices logo 
table of contents or parameters of other comparable current market transactions  or other observable data supporting a fair value based on a pricing model at the inception of a contract  fair value is based on the transaction price 
the company also uses pricing models to manage the risks introduced by otc derivatives 
depending on the product and the terms of the transaction  the fair value of otc derivative products can be modeled using a series of techniques  including closed form analytic formulae  such as the black scholes option pricing model  simulation models or a combination thereof  applied consistently 
in the case of more established derivative products  the pricing models used by the company are widely accepted by the financial services industry 
pricing models take into account the contract terms  including the maturity  as well as market parameters such as interest rates  volatility and the creditworthiness of the counterparty 
many pricing models do not entail material subjectivity because the methodologies employed do not necessitate significant judgment  and the pricing inputs are observed from actively quoted markets  as is the case for generic interest rate swap and option contracts 
a substantial majority of otc derivative products valued by the company using pricing models fall into this category 
other derivative products  typically the newest and most complex products  will require more judgment in the implementation of the modeling technique applied due to the complexity of the modeling assumptions and the reduced price transparency surrounding the model s market parameters 
the company manages its market exposure for otc derivative products primarily by entering into offsetting derivative contracts or other related financial instruments 
the company s trading divisions  the financial control department and the market risk department continuously monitor the price changes of the otc derivatives in relation to the hedges 
for a further discussion of the price transparency of the company s otc derivative products  see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management credit risk in part ii  item a 
the company employs control processes to validate the fair value of its financial instruments  including those derived from pricing models 
these control processes are designed to assure that the values used for financial reporting are based on observable market prices or market based parameters wherever possible 
in the event that market prices or parameters are not available  the control processes are designed to assure that the valuation approach utilized is appropriate and consistently applied and the assumptions are reasonable 
these control processes include reviews of the pricing model s theoretical soundness and appropriateness by company personnel with relevant expertise who are independent from the trading desks 
additionally  groups independent from the trading divisions within the financial control and market risk departments participate in the review and validation of the fair values generated from pricing models  as appropriate 
where a pricing model is used to determine fair value  recently executed comparable transactions and other observable market data are considered for purposes of validating assumptions underlying the model 
consistent with market practice  the company has individually negotiated agreements with certain counterparties to exchange collateral margining based on the level of fair values of the derivative contracts they have executed 
through this margining process  one party or both parties to a derivative contract provides the other party with information about the fair value of the derivative contract to calculate the amount of collateral required 
this sharing of fair value information provides additional support of the company s recorded fair value for the relevant otc derivative products 
for certain otc derivative products  the company  along with other market participants  contributes derivative pricing information to aggregation services that synthesize the data and make it accessible to subscribers 
this information is then used to evaluate the fair value of these otc derivative products

transfers of financial assets 
the company engages in securitization activities in connection with certain of its businesses 
gains and losses from securitizations are recognized in the consolidated statements of income when the company relinquishes control of the transferred financial assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement no 
 and other related pronouncements 
the gain or loss on the sale of financial assets depends  in part  on the previous carrying amount of the assets involved in the transfer  allocated between the assets sold and the retained interests based upon their respective fair values at the date of sale 
logo 
table of contents in connection with its institutional securities business  the company engages in securitization transactions to facilitate client needs and as a means of selling financial assets 
the company recognizes any interests in the transferred assets and any liabilities incurred in securitization transactions in its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value 
subsequently  changes in the fair value of such interests are recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
in connection with its credit services business  the company periodically sells consumer loans through asset securitizations and continues to service these loans 
the present value of the future net servicing revenues that the company estimates it will receive over the term of the securitized loans is recognized in income as the loans are securitized 
a corresponding asset also is recorded and then amortized as a charge to income over the term of the securitized loans 
the securitization gain or loss involves the company s best estimates of key assumptions  including forecasted credit losses  payment rates  forward yield curves and appropriate discount rates 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different financial results 
allowance for consumer loan losses 
the allowance for consumer loan losses in the company s credit services business is established through a charge to the provision for consumer loan losses 
provisions are made to reserve for estimated losses in outstanding loan balances 
the allowance for consumer loan losses is a significant estimate that represents management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the consumer loan portfolio 
the allowance for consumer loan losses is primarily applicable to the owned homogeneous consumer credit card loan portfolio that is evaluated quarterly for adequacy 
in calculating the allowance for consumer loan losses  the company uses a systematic and consistently applied approach 
the company regularly performs a migration analysis a technique used to estimate the likelihood that a consumer loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately charge off of delinquent and current consumer credit card accounts in order to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for consumer loan losses 
the migration analysis considers uncollectible principal  interest and fees reflected in consumer loans 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for consumer loan losses  management also considers factors that may impact future credit loss experience  including current economic conditions  recent trends in delinquencies and bankruptcy filings  account collection management  policy changes  account seasoning  loan volume and amounts  payment rates and forecasting uncertainties 
a provision for consumer loan losses is charged against earnings to maintain the allowance for consumer loan losses at an appropriate level 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different provisions for consumer loan losses see credit services provision for consumer loan losses herein 
aircraft under operating leases 
the company s aircraft portfolio consists of aircraft to be held and used and aircraft that are to be disposed of by sale held for sale 
aircraft under operating leases that are to be held and used are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges 
depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the aircraft asset  which is generally years from the date of manufacture 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company s aircraft that are to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the aircraft may not be recoverable 
under sfas no 
 the carrying value of an aircraft may not be recoverable if its projected undiscounted cash flows are less than its carrying value 
if an aircraft s projected undiscounted cash flows are less than its carrying value  the company will recognize an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the aircraft 
the fair value of the company s impaired aircraft is based upon the average market appraisal values obtained from independent appraisal companies 
estimates of future cash flows associated with the aircraft assets as well as the appraisals of fair value are critical to the determination of whether an impairment exists and the amount of the impairment charge  if any see note to the consolidated financial statements 
aircraft under operating leases that fulfill the criteria to be classified as held for sale in accordance with sfas no 
are stated at the lower of carrying value ie  cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment logo 
table of contents charges or fair value less estimated cost to sell 
depreciation expense is not recorded for aircraft that are classified as held for sale 
the company will recognize a charge for any initial or subsequent write down to fair value less estimated cost to sell see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
a gain would be recognized for any subsequent increase in fair value less cost to sell  but not in excess of the cumulative loss previously recognized for a write down to fair value less cost to sell 
certain factors affecting results of operations 
the company s results of operations may be materially affected by market fluctuations and by economic factors 
in addition  results of operations in the past have been  and in the future may continue to be  materially affected by many factors of a global nature  including political  economic and market conditions  the availability and cost of capital  the level and volatility of equity prices  commodity prices and interest rates  currency values and other market indices  technological changes and events  the availability and cost of credit  inflation  and investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets 
in addition  there has been a heightened level of legislative  legal and regulatory developments related to the financial services industry that potentially could increase costs  thereby affecting future results of operations 
such factors also may have an impact on the company s ability to achieve its strategic objectives on a global basis 
the company s institutional securities business  particularly its involvement in primary and secondary markets for all types of financial products  including derivatives  is subject to substantial positive and negative fluctuations due to a variety of factors that the company cannot control or predict with great certainty  including variations in the fair value of securities and other financial products and the volatility and liquidity of global trading markets 
fluctuations also occur due to the level of global market activity  which  among other things  affects the size  number  and timing of investment banking client assignments and transactions and the realization of returns from the company s principal investments 
such factors also affect the level of individual investor participation in the financial markets  which impacts the results of the individual investor group 
the level of global market activity also could impact the flow of investment capital into or from assets under management and supervision and the way in which such capital is allocated among money market  equity  fixed income or other investment alternatives  which could cause fluctuations to occur in the company s investment management business 
in the company s credit services business  changes in economic variables  such as the number and size of personal bankruptcy filings  the rate of unemployment  and the level of consumer confidence and consumer debt  may substantially affect consumer loan levels and credit quality  which  in turn  could impact the results of credit services 
the company s results of operations also may be materially affected by competitive factors 
included among the principal competitive factors affecting the institutional securities and individual investor group businesses are the company s reputation  the quality of its personnel  its products  services and advice  capital commitments  relative pricing and innovation 
competition in the company s investment management business is affected by a number of factors  including the company s reputation  investment objectives  quality of investment professionals  relative performance of investment products  advertising and sales promotion efforts  fee levels  distribution channels  and types and quality of services offered 
in the credit services business  competition centers on merchant acceptance of credit and debit cards  account acquisition and customer utilization of credit and debit cards  all of which are impacted by the types of fees  interest rates and other features offered 
the company strives to increase market share in all of its businesses and evaluates the competitive position of its businesses by  among other things  monitoring various market share data 
for example  in the institutional securities investment banking business  the company monitors its market share in key areas such as announced and completed worldwide mergers and acquisitions  worldwide equity underwritings and worldwide debt underwritings 
in the institutional securities sales and trading business  the company monitors its market share via independent client surveys as well as its market share of global exchange and non exchange volumes 
in the individual investor group business  the company monitors its market share of client assets and the number of representatives 
in the logo 
table of contents investment management business  the company monitors its market share of assets under management or supervision and mutual fund flows among mutual fund managers 
it also monitors the relative performance of its funds as determined by organizations such as morningstar and lipper 
in the credit services business  the company monitors its ranking in the number of merchant and cash access locations  the level of general purpose credit card loan balances outstanding  transaction volume and the credit quality of its loan portfolio 
the company competes with commercial banks  insurance companies  sponsors of mutual funds  hedge funds  energy companies and other companies offering financial services in the us  globally and through the internet 
the company competes with some of its competitors globally and with others on a regional or product basis 
certain sectors of the financial services industry have become considerably more concentrated  as financial institutions involved in a broad range of financial services industries have been acquired by or merged into other firms 
such convergence could result in the company s competitors gaining greater capital and other resources  such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity 
it is possible that competition may become even more intense as the company continues to compete with financial institutions that may be larger  or better capitalized  or may have a stronger local presence in certain areas 
in addition  the company has experienced competition for qualified employees 
the company s ability to sustain or improve its competitive position will substantially depend on its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees while managing compensation costs 
as a result of the above economic and competitive factors  net income and revenues in any particular period may not be representative of full year results and may vary significantly from year to year and from quarter to quarter 
the company intends to manage its business for the long term and to mitigate the potential effects of market downturns by strengthening its competitive position in the global financial services industry through diversification of its revenue sources  enhancement of its global franchise  and management of costs and its capital structure 
the company s overall financial results will continue to be affected by its ability and success in addressing client goals  maintaining high levels of profitable business activities  emphasizing fee based products that are designed to generate a continuing stream of revenues  evaluating product pricing  managing risks  costs and its capital position  and maintaining its strong reputation and franchise 
in addition  the complementary trends in the financial services industry of consolidation and globalization present  among other things  technological  risk management and other infrastructure challenges that will require effective resource allocation in order for the company to remain competitive

table of contents liquidity and capital resources 
the company s senior management establishes the overall liquidity and capital policies of the company 
through various risk and control committees  the company s senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies  monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing  and oversees the liquidity and interest rate and currency sensitivity of the company s asset and liability position 
these committees  along with the company s treasury department and other control groups  also assist in evaluating  monitoring and controlling the impact that the company s business activities have on its consolidated balance sheet  liquidity and capital structure  thereby helping to ensure that its business activities are integrated with the company s liquidity and capital policies 
for a description of the company s other principal risks and how they are monitored and managed  see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management in part ii  item a 
the company s liquidity and funding risk management policies are designed to mitigate the potential risk that the company may be unable to access adequate financing to service its financial obligations when they come due without material  adverse franchise or business impact 
the key objectives of the liquidity and funding risk management framework are to support the successful execution of the company s business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity through the business cycle and during periods of financial distress 
the principal elements of the company s liquidity framework are the cash capital policy  the liquidity reserve and stress testing through the contingency funding plan 
comprehensive financing guidelines collateralized funding  long term funding strategy  surplus capacity  diversification  staggered maturities  committed credit facilities support the company s target liquidity profile 
the balance sheet 
the company monitors and evaluates the composition and size of its balance sheet 
given the nature of the company s market making and customer financing activities  the overall size of the balance sheet fluctuates from time to time 
a substantial portion of the company s total assets consists of highly liquid marketable securities and short term receivables arising principally from its institutional securities sales and trading activities 
the highly liquid nature of these assets provides the company with flexibility in financing and managing its business 
the company s total assets increased to billion at november  from billion at november  the increase was primarily due to increases in securities borrowed  securities purchased under agreements to resell  financial instruments owned largely driven by derivative contracts  receivables from customers and cash and securities segregated under federal and other regulations 
the increase in securities borrowed  securities purchased under agreements to resell and receivables from customers was largely due to growth in the company s equity financing related activities 
the increase in derivative contracts was associated with interest rate  currency  equity and commodity derivative products due to increased customer flow and market activity 
cash and securities segregated under federal and other regulations increased due to increased levels of customer activity 
balance sheet leverage ratios are one indicator of capital adequacy when viewed in the context of a company s overall liquidity and capital policies 
the company views the adjusted leverage ratio as a more relevant measure of financial risk when comparing financial services firms and evaluating leverage trends 
the company has adopted a definition of adjusted assets that excludes certain self funded assets considered to have minimal market  credit and or liquidity risk 
these low risk assets generally are attributable to the company s matched book and securities lending businesses 
adjusted assets are calculated by reducing gross assets by aggregate resale agreements and securities borrowed less non derivative short positions and assets recorded under certain provisions of sfas no 
and fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  as revised 
the adjusted leverage ratio reflects the deduction from shareholders equity of the amount of equity used to support goodwill and intangible assets as the company does not view this amount of equity as available to support its risk capital needs 
in addition  the company views junior subordinated debt issued to capital trusts as a component of its capital base given the inherent characteristics of the securities 
these logo 
table of contents characteristics include the long dated nature final maturity at issuance of years extendible at the company s option by a further years  the company s ability to defer coupon interest for up to consecutive quarters and the subordinated nature of the obligations in the capital structure

in this regard  the company actively manages its consolidated equity capital position based upon  among other things  business opportunities  capital availability and rates of return together with internal capital policies  regulatory requirements and rating agency guidelines and  therefore  in the future may expand or contract its equity capital base to address the changing needs of its businesses 
the company attempts to maintain total equity  on a consolidated basis  at least equal to the sum of its operating subsidiaries equity 
the company uses an economic capital model to determine the amount of equity capital needed to support the risk of the company s business activities and to ensure that the company remains adequately capitalized 
economic capital is defined as the amount of capital needed to run the business through the business cycle and satisfy the requirements of the market  regulators and rating agencies 
the company assigns economic capital to each business unit based primarily on regulatory capital usage and potential stress losses across various dimensions of market  credit  business and operational risks 
additional capital is assigned for goodwill  intangible assets  principal investment risk  and balance sheet usage as required to meet the company s leverage ratio targets 
the company s framework for allocating economic capital is intended to align equity capital with the risks in each business  provide business managers with tools for measuring and managing risk  and allow senior management to evaluate risk adjusted returns to facilitate resource allocation decisions

table of contents liquidity management policies 
the primary goal of the company s liquidity and funding activities is to ensure adequate financing over a wide range of potential credit ratings and market environments 
given the highly liquid nature of the company s balance sheet  day to day funding requirements are largely fulfilled through the use of stable collateralized financing 
the company has centralized management of credit sensitive unsecured funding sources in the treasury department 
in order to meet target liquidity requirements and withstand an unforeseen contraction in credit availability  the company has designed a liquidity management framework 
liquidity management framework designed to contingency funding plan ascertain the company s ability to manage a prolonged liquidity contraction and provide a course of action over a one year time period to ensure orderly functioning of the businesses 
the contingency funding plan sets forth the process and the internal and external communication flows necessary to ensure effective management of the contingency event 
analytical processes exist to periodically evaluate and report the liquidity risk exposures of the organization under management defined scenarios 
cash capital ensure that the company can fund its balance sheet while repaying its financial obligations maturing within one year without issuing new unsecured debt 
the company attempts to achieve this by maintaining sufficient cash capital long term debt and equity capital to finance illiquid assets and the portion of its securities inventory that is not expected to be financed on a secured basis in a credit stressed environment 
liquidity reserve maintain  at all times  a liquidity reserve composed of immediately available cash and cash equivalents and a pool of unencumbered securities that can be sold or pledged to provide same day liquidity to the company 
the reserve is periodically assessed and determined based on day to day funding requirements and strategic liquidity targets 
the liquidity reserve averaged approximately billion during fiscal contingency funding plan 
the company s contingency funding plan cfp model incorporates a wide range of potential cash outflows during a liquidity stress event  including  but not limited to  the following i repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within one year  ii maturity roll off of outstanding letters of credit with no further issuance  and replacement with cash collateral  iii return of unsecured securities borrowed and any cash raised against these securities  iv additional collateral that would be required by counterparties in the event of a ratings downgrade  v higher haircuts on or lower availability of secured funding  vi client cash withdrawals  vii drawdowns on unfunded commitments provided to third parties  and viii discretionary unsecured debt buybacks 
the company s cfp is developed at the legal entity level in order to capture specific cash requirements and availability for the parent company and each of its major operating subsidiaries 
the cfp assumes that the parent company does not have access to cash that may be trapped at subsidiaries due to regulatory  legal or tax constraints 
in addition  the cfp assumes that the parent company does not draw down on its committed credit facilities 
bank subsidiaries that operate in a deposit protected environment are not expected to be impacted by a company specific credit event and are expected to continue to provide reliable funding for assets held in these entities 
these entities include discover bank  which primarily funds credit card receivables  and morgan stanley bank  which funds senior loans and certain mortgage assets 
discover bank also accesses the asset backed financing market for a significant portion of its funding requirements

table of contents cash capital 
the company maintains a cash capital model that measures long term funding sources against requirements 
sources of cash capital include the parent company s equity and the non current portion of certain long term borrowings 
uses of cash capital include the following i illiquid assets such as buildings  aircraft  equipment  goodwill and intangible assets  exchange memberships  deferred tax assets and principal investments  ii a portion of securities inventory that is not expected to be financed on a secured basis in a credit stressed environment  ie  stressed haircuts  and iii expected drawdowns on unfunded commitments 
the company seeks to maintain a surplus cash capital position 
the company s equity capital of billion including junior subordinated debt issued to capital trusts  long term borrowings debt obligations scheduled to mature in more than months of billion and capital units of million comprised the company s total capital of billion as of november   which substantially exceeded cash capital requirements 
liquidity reserve 
the company seeks to maintain a target liquidity reserve which is sized to cover daily funding needs and to meet strategic liquidity targets  including coverage of a significant portion of expected cash outflows over a short term horizon in a potential liquidity crisis 
prior to fiscal  this liquidity reserve was held in the form of cash deposited with banks 
beginning in late fiscal  this liquidity reserve was increased and separated into a cash component and a pool of unencumbered securities 
the pool of unencumbered securities  against which funding can be raised  is managed on a global basis  and securities for the pool are chosen accordingly 
the us held component consists largely of us government bonds and at november  totaled billion 
the non us component consists of european government bonds and other high quality collateral 
the company believes that diversifying the form in which its liquidity reserve cash and securities is maintained enhances its ability to quickly and efficiently source funding in a stressed environment 
the company s funding requirements and target liquidity reserve may vary based on changes in the level and composition of its balance sheet  timing of specific transactions  client financing activity  market conditions and seasonal factors 
committed credit facilities 
the maintenance of committed credit facilities serves to further diversify the company s funding sources 
the company values committed credit as a secondary component of its liquidity management framework 
the company maintains a senior revolving credit agreement with a group of banks to support general liquidity needs  including the issuance of commercial paper  which consists of two separate tranches a us dollar tranche with the company as borrower and a japanese yen tranche with morgan stanley japan limited msjl as borrower and the company as guarantor 
under this combined facility the ms msjl facility  the banks are committed to provide up to billion under the us dollar tranche and billion japanese yen under the japanese yen tranche 
at november   the company had a billion surplus shareholders equity as compared with the ms msjl facility s covenant requirement 
the company maintains a master collateral facility that enables morgan stanley co 
incorporated ms co  one of the company s us broker dealer subsidiaries  to pledge certain collateral to secure loan arrangements  letters of credit and other financial accommodations the ms co 
facility

at november   ms co 
had a billion surplus consolidated stockholder s equity and a billion surplus net capital  each as defined in the ms co 
facility and as compared with the ms co 
facility s covenant requirements 
the company also maintains a revolving credit facility that enables morgan stanley co 
international limited msil  the company s london based broker dealer subsidiary  to obtain committed funding from a syndicate logo 
table of contents of banks the msil facility by providing a broad range of collateral under repurchase agreements for a secured repo facility and a company guarantee for an unsecured facility 
the syndicate of banks is committed to provide up to an aggregate of billion  available in six major currencies 
at november   msil had a billion surplus shareholder s equity and a billion surplus financial resources  each as defined in the msil facility and as compared with the msil facility s covenant requirements 
the company anticipates that it may utilize the ms msjl facility  the ms co 
facility or the msil facility the credit facilities for short term funding from time to time see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not believe that any of the covenant requirements in any of its credit facilities will impair its ability to obtain funding under the credit facilities  to pay its current level of dividends  or to secure loan arrangements  letters of credit or other financial accommodations 
at november   no borrowings were outstanding under any of the credit facilities 
the company and its subsidiaries also maintain a series of committed bilateral credit facilities to support general liquidity needs 
these facilities are expected to be drawn from time to time to cover short term funding needs 
the committed credit facilities demonstrate the diversity of lenders to the company covering geographic regions  including north america  europe and asia 
on a yearly basis  the company s committed credit strategy is reviewed and approved by its senior management 
this strategy takes the company s total liquidity sources into consideration when determining the appropriate size and mix of committed credit 
the company  through one of its subsidiaries  maintains several funded committed credit facilities to support the collateralized commercial and residential mortgage whole loan business 
lenders to these facilities provided an aggregate of billion in financing at november  funding management policies 
the company funds its balance sheet on a global basis through diverse sources 
these sources include the company s equity capital  long term debt  repurchase agreements  us  canadian  euro  japanese and australian commercial paper  asset backed securitizations  letters of credit  unsecured bond borrowings  securities lending  buy sell agreements  municipal reinvestments  promissory notes  master notes  and committed and uncommitted lines of credit 
repurchase agreement transactions  securities lending and a portion of the company s bank borrowings are made on a collateralized basis and  therefore  provide a more stable source of funding than short term unsecured borrowings 
the company has active financing programs for both standard and structured products in the us  european and asian markets  targeting global investors and currencies such as the us dollar  euro  british pound  australian dollar and japanese yen 
the company s bank subsidiaries solicit deposits from consumers  purchase federal funds  issue short term institutional certificates of deposits and issue bank notes 
interest bearing deposits are classified by type as savings  brokered and other time deposits 
savings deposits consist primarily of money market deposit accounts sold nationally and savings deposits from individual securities clients 
brokered deposits consist primarily of certificates of deposits issued by the company s bank subsidiaries 
other time deposits include individual and institutional certificates of deposits 
the company s funding management policies are designed to provide for financings that are executed in a manner that reduces the risk of disruption to the company s operations that would result from an interruption in the availability of the company s funding sources 
the company pursues a strategy of diversification of funding sources by product  by investor and by region and attempts to ensure that the tenor of the company s liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed 
maturities of financings are designed to manage exposure to refinancing risk in any one period 
the company maintains a surplus of unused short term funding sources at all times to withstand any unforeseen contraction in credit capacity 
in addition  the company attempts to maintain cash and unhypothecated marketable securities equal to at least of its logo 
table of contents outstanding short term unsecured borrowings 
the company also maintains committed credit facilities described above to support its ongoing borrowing programs 
secured financing 
a substantial portion of the company s total assets consists of highly liquid marketable securities and short term receivables arising principally from its institutional securities sales and trading activities 
the highly liquid nature of these assets provides the company with flexibility in financing these assets with stable collateralized borrowing  while the securitization market allows for the securitization of the credit card receivables arising from the company s credit services business 
the company s goal is to maximize funding through less credit sensitive collateralized borrowings and asset securitizations in order to reduce reliance on unsecured financing 
the institutional securities business emphasizes the use of collateralized short term borrowings to limit the growth of short term unsecured funding which is more typically subject to disruption during periods of financial stress 
as part of this effort  the institutional securities business continually seeks to expand its global secured borrowing capacity 
similarly  credit services  through its use of the securitization market  reduces the need for other unsecured parent company financing 
unsecured financing 
the company views long term debt as a stable source of funding for core inventories  consumer loans and illiquid assets 
in general  securities inventories not financed by secured funding sources and the majority of current assets are financed with a combination of short term funding  floating rate long term debt or fixed rate long term debt swapped to a floating rate 
fixed assets are financed with fixed rate long term debt 
both fixed rate and floating rate long term debt in addition to sources of funds accessed directly by the company s credit services business are used to finance the company s consumer loan portfolio 
consumer loan financing is targeted to match the repricing and duration characteristics of the loans financed 
the company uses derivative products primarily interest rate  currency and equity swaps to assist in asset and liability management  reduce borrowing costs and hedge interest rate risk see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company issues long term debt in excess of the amount necessary to meet the needs of its securities inventory and less liquid assets as determined by its cash capital policy 
in addition to these needs  long term debt funding is employed to enhance the company s liquidity position by reducing reliance on short term credit sensitive instruments eg  commercial paper and other unsecured short term borrowings 
availability and cost of financing to the company can vary depending on market conditions  the volume of certain trading and lending activities  the company s credit ratings and the overall availability of credit 
the company has a portfolio approach for managing the unsecured debt issued by the parent company 
this approach gives the company flexibility to manage the unsecured debt portfolio across maturities  currencies  investors  and regions  taking into account market capacity and pricing 
down lending to subsidiaries is managed to ensure that inter company borrowings mature before those of the parent company 
liquidity and funding policies recognize potential constraints on the company s ability to transfer funds between regulated entities and the parent company 
during fiscal  the company s long term financing strategy was driven  in part  by its continued focus on improved balance sheet strength evaluated through enhanced capital and liquidity positions  a significant factor in the maintenance of strong credit ratings 
as a result  for fiscal  billion of unsecured debt was issued excluding certain equity and credit linked products not considered to be a component of the company s cash capital 
financing transactions were structured to ensure staggered maturities  thereby mitigating refinancing risk  and a diversified investor base was targeted through sales to domestic as well as international institutional and retail clients 
unsecured debt issuance activity resulted in a net increase in the long term debt component of the cash capital portfolio of approximately billion 
logo 
table of contents credit ratings 
the company s reliance on external sources to finance a significant portion of its day to day operations makes access to global sources of financing important 
the cost and availability of unsecured financing generally are dependent on the company s short term and long term credit ratings 
factors that are significant to the determination of the company s credit ratings or otherwise affect the ability of the company to raise short term and long term financing include its level and volatility of earnings  relative positions in the markets in which it operates  geographic and product diversification  risk management policies  cash liquidity  capital structure  corporate lending credit risk  and legal and regulatory developments 
a deterioration in any of the previously mentioned factors or combination of these factors may lead rating agencies to downgrade the credit ratings of the company  thereby increasing the cost to the company in obtaining unsecured funding 
in addition  the company s debt ratings can have a significant impact on certain trading revenues  particularly in those businesses where longer term counterparty performance is critical  such as otc derivative transactions  including credit derivatives and interest rate swaps 
in connection with certain otc trading agreements and certain other agreements associated with the institutional securities business  the company would be required to provide additional collateral to certain counterparties in the event of a downgrade by either moody s investors service or standard poor s 
at november   the amount of additional collateral that would be required in the event of a one notch downgrade of the company s senior debt credit rating was approximately million 
of this amount  million approximately relates to bilateral arrangements between the company and other parties where upon the downgrade of one party  the downgraded party must deliver incremental collateral to the other 
these bilateral downgrade arrangements are a risk management tool used extensively by the company as credit exposures are reduced if counterparties are downgraded 
as of january   the company s credit ratings were as follows commercial paper senior debt dominion bond rating service limited r middle aa low fitch ratings f aa moody s investors service p aa rating and investment information  inc a aa standard poor s a a on september   standard poor s placed the company s senior debt ratings on positive outlook 
off balance sheet arrangements 
the company enters into various arrangements with unconsolidated entities  including variable interest entities  primarily in connection with its institutional securities and credit services businesses 
institutional securities activities 
the company utilizes special purpose entities spe primarily in connection with securitization activities 
the company engages in securitization activities related to commercial and residential mortgage loans  us agency collateralized mortgage obligations  corporate bonds and loans  municipal bonds and other types of financial assets 
the company may retain interests in the securitized financial assets as one or more tranches of the securitization 
these retained interests are included in the consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value 
any changes in the fair value of such retained interests are recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
retained interests in securitized financial assets associated with the company s institutional securities business were approximately billion at november   the majority of which were related to residential mortgage loan  us agency collateralized mortgage obligation and commercial mortgage loan securitization transactions 
for further information about the company s institutional securities securitization activities  see notes and to the consolidated financial logo 
table of contents statements 
in addition  see note to the consolidated financial statements for information about variable interest entities  the company s arrangements with these entities and its adoption of fin  as revised 
the company has entered into liquidity facilities with spes and other counterparties  whereby the company is required to make certain payments if losses or defaults occur 
the company often may have recourse to the underlying assets held by the spes in the event payments are required under such liquidity facilities see note to the consolidated financial statements 
credit services activities 
the asset securitization market is a significant source of funding for the company s credit services business 
by utilizing this market  the company further diversifies its funding sources  realizes cost effective funding and reduces reliance on the company s other funding sources  including unsecured debt 
the securitization transaction structures utilized for the credit services business are accounted for as sales  ie  off balance sheet transactions in accordance with ie gaap see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in connection with its credit card securitization program  the company transfers credit card receivables  on a revolving basis  to the trusts  which issue asset backed securities that are registered with the securities and exchange commission the sec  are used to support the issuance of publicly listed notes or are privately placed 
this structure includes certain features designed to protect the investors that could result in earlier than expected amortization of the transactions  potentially resulting in the need for the company to obtain alternative funding arrangements 
the primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements economic early amortization 
economic early amortization risk reflects the possibility of negative net securitization cash flows which would occur if the coupon  contractual servicing fee and net charge offs exceeded the collections of finance charges and cardmember fees on securitized credit card receivables and is driven primarily by the trusts credit card receivables performance in particular  receivables yield  cardmember fees and credit losses incurred as well as the contractual rate of return of the asset backed securities 
in the event of an economic early amortization  receivables that otherwise would have been subsequently purchased by the trusts from the company would instead continue to be recognized on the company s consolidated statements of financial condition since the cash flows generated in the trusts would instead be used to repay investors in the asset backed securities 
these recognized receivables would require the company to obtain alternative funding 
although the company believes that the combination of factors that would result in an economic early amortization event is remote  the company also believes its access to alternative funding sources would mitigate this potential liquidity risk 
a group of banks is committed to provide up to billion under a credit facility that supports the short term extendible asset backed certificate program issued by the discover card master trust i 
such credit facility was renewed in the first quarter of fiscal guarantees

high yield instruments 
in connection with the company s fixed income securities activities  the company underwrites  trades  invests and makes markets in non investment grade instruments high yield instruments 
for purposes of this discussion  high yield instruments are defined as fixed income  emerging market  preferred equity securities and distressed debt rated bb or lower or equivalent ratings by recognized credit rating agencies as well as non rated securities which  in the opinion of the company  contain credit risks associated with non investment grade instruments 
for purposes of this discussion  positions associated with the company s credit derivatives business are not included because reporting gross market value exposures would not accurately reflect the risks associated with these positions due to the manner in which they are risk managed 
high yield instruments generally involve greater risk than investment grade securities due to the lower credit ratings of the issuers  which typically have relatively high levels of indebtedness and  therefore  are more sensitive to adverse economic conditions 
in addition  the market for high yield instruments can be characterized as having periods of higher volatility and reduced liquidity

regulatory developments 
in april  the sec approved the cse rule that establishes a voluntary framework for comprehensive  group wide risk management procedures and consolidated supervision of certain financial services holding companies by the sec 
the framework is designed to minimize the duplicative regulatory requirements on us securities firms resulting from the european union eu directive ec concerning the supplementary supervision of financial conglomerates active in the eu 
the cse rule also would allow ms co  one of the company s us broker dealers  to use an alternative method  based on mathematical models  to calculate net capital charges for market and derivatives related credit risk 
under the cse rule  the sec will regulate the holding company and any unregulated affiliate of a registered broker dealer  including subjecting the holding company to capital requirements generally consistent with the standards of the basel committee on banking supervision basel ii 
in december  the company applied to the sec for permission to operate under the cse rule and expects to be approved in fiscal the company continues to work with its regulators to understand and assess the impact of the cse rule and basel ii capital standards 
the company cannot fully predict the impact that these changes will have on its businesses  however  compliance with consolidated supervision and the imposition of revised capital standards are likely to impose additional costs and may affect capital raising and allocation decisions

effects of inflation and changes in foreign exchange rates 
the company s assets to a large extent are liquid in nature  and  therefore  not significantly affected by inflation  although inflation may result in increases in the company s expenses  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered 
to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets  upon the value of financial instruments and upon the markets for consumer credit services  it may adversely affect the company s financial position and profitability 
a significant portion of the company s business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar  and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar can therefore affect the value of us dollar net assets  revenues and expenses 
potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored  and  where cost justified  strategies are adopted that are designed to reduce the impact of these fluctuations on the company s financial performance 
these strategies may include the financing of non us dollar assets with direct or swap based borrowings in the same currency and the use of currency forward contracts or the spot market in various hedging transactions related to net assets  revenues  expenses or cash flows

the american jobs creation act of the act  signed into law on october   provides for a special one time tax deduction  or dividend received deduction drd  of of qualifying foreign earnings that are repatriated in either a company s last tax year that began before the enactment date or the first tax year that begins during the one year period beginning on the enactment date 
fsp provides entities additional time to assess the effect of repatriating foreign earnings under the act for purposes of applying sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which typically requires the effect of a new tax law to be recorded in the period of enactment 
the company will elect  if applicable  to apply the drd to qualifying dividends of foreign earnings repatriated in its fiscal year ending november  the company is awaiting further clarifying guidance from the us treasury department on certain provisions of the act 
once this guidance is received  the company expects to complete its evaluation of the effects of the act during fiscal under the limitations on the amount of dividends qualifying for the drd of the act  the maximum repatriation of the company s foreign earnings that may qualify for the special one time drd is approximately billion 
therefore  the range of possible amounts of qualifying dividends of foreign earnings is between zero and approximately billion 
because the evaluation is ongoing  it is not yet practical to estimate a range of possible income tax effects of potential repatriations 
stock based compensation 
effective december   the company adopted sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 using the prospective adoption method 
the company currently records compensation expense based upon the fair value of stock based awards both deferred stock and stock options in accordance with sfas no 
prior to fiscal  the company accounted for its stock based awards under the intrinsic value approach in accordance with apb see equity based compensation program herein and notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r eliminates the intrinsic value method under apb as an alternative method of accounting for stock based awards 
sfas no 
r also revises the fair value based method of accounting for share based payment liabilities  forfeitures and modifications of stock based awards and clarifies sfas no 
s guidance in several areas  including measuring fair value  classifying an award as equity or as a liability and attributing compensation cost to reporting periods 
in addition  sfas no 
r amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows  to require that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid  which is included within operating cash flows 
the company is required to adopt sfas no 
r for the interim period beginning september  using a modified version of prospective application or may elect to apply a modified version of retrospective application 
logo 
table of contents the company currently expects to early adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method with an effective date of december  the company s past practice for recognizing compensation expense for equity based awards included the recognition of a portion of the award in the year of grant 
based upon the terms of the company s equity based compensation program  the company will no longer be able to recognize a portion of the award in the grant year under sfas no 
r 
this will have the effect of reducing compensation expense in fiscal as a result  fiscal compensation expense will include the amortization of fiscal and fiscal awards but will not include any amortization for fiscal awards 
if sfas no 
r was not in effect  fiscal s compensation expense would have included three years of amortization ie  for awards granted in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal 
in addition  the fiscal awards  which will begin to be amortized in fiscal  will be amortized over a shorter period and years as compared with awards granted in fiscal and fiscal and years

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management 
risk management policy and control structure 
risk is an inherent part of the company s business and activities 
the extent to which the company properly and effectively identifies  assesses  monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its activities is critical to its soundness and profitability 
the company s broad based portfolio of business activities helps reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its net revenues as a whole 
the company seeks to identify  assess  monitor and manage  in accordance with defined policies and procedures  the following principal risks involved in the company s business activities market  credit  operational  legal  and liquidity and funding risk 
liquidity and funding risk is discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources in part ii  item the company s currency exposure relating to its net monetary investments in non us dollar functional currency subsidiaries is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the cornerstone of the company s risk management philosophy is protection of the company s franchise and reputation 
guardianship is based on three key principles accountability  transparency and independent oversight 
given the importance of effective risk management to the company s reputation  senior management requires thorough and frequent communication and appropriate escalation of risk matters 
risk management at the company requires independent company level oversight  accountability of the company s business segments  constant communication  judgment  and knowledge of specialized products and markets 
the company s senior management takes an active role in the identification  assessment and management of various risks at both the company and business segment level 
in recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the global financial services business  the company s risk management philosophy  with its attendant policies  procedures and methodologies  is evolutionary in nature and subject to ongoing review and modification 
the nature of the company s risks  coupled with this risk management philosophy  informs the company s risk governance structure 
the company s risk governance structure includes the firm risk committee and the capital committee  the chief administrative and risk officer  the internal audit department  independent control groups and various risk control managers  committees and groups located within the business segments 
the firm risk committee  composed of the company s most senior officers  oversees the company s risk management structure 
the firm risk committee s responsibilities include comprehensive oversight of the company s risk management principles  procedures and limits  and monitoring of material financial  operational and franchise risks 
the firm risk committee is overseen by the audit committee of the board of directors the audit committee 
the capital committee oversees alignment of the company s resource allocation with strategic priorities 
the capital committee s responsibilities include approving acquisitions and divestitures and making recommendations to the board of directors when appropriate  directing capital to the business segments  approving technical capital recommendations  approving capital exceptions  and approving methodologies for capital allocation for the company and the business segments 
the chief administrative and risk officer  a member of the firm risk committee  oversees compliance with company risk limits  approves certain excessions of company risk limits  reviews material market  credit  and liquidity and funding risks  and reviews results of risk management processes with the audit committee 
the internal audit department provides independent risk and control assessment and reports to the audit committee and administratively to the chief legal officer 
the internal audit department periodically examines the company s operational and control environment and conducts audits designed to cover all major risk categories 
logo 
table of contents the market risk  credit  financial control  treasury and law departments collectively  the company control groups  which are all independent of the company s business units  assist senior management and the firm risk committee in monitoring and controlling the company s risk through a number of control processes 
the company is committed to employing qualified personnel with appropriate expertise in each of its various administrative and business areas to implement effectively the company s risk management and monitoring systems and processes 
each business segment has a risk committee that is responsible for ensuring that the business segment  as applicable adheres to established limits for market  credit and other risks  implements risk measurement  monitoring  and management policies and procedures that are consistent with the risk framework established by the firm risk committee  and reviews  on a periodic basis  its aggregate risk exposures  risk exception experience  and the efficacy of its risk identification  measurement  monitoring  and management policies and procedures  and related controls 
each of the company s business segments also has designated risk managers  committees and groups  including operations and information technology groups collectively  segment control groups and  together with the company control groups  the control groups to manage and monitor specific risks and report to the business segment risk committee 
the control groups work together to review the risk monitoring and risk management policies and procedures relating to  among other things  the segment s market and credit risk profile  sales practices  pricing of consumer loans and reserve adequacy  reputation  legal enforceability  and operational and technological risks 
participation by the senior officers of the control groups helps ensure that risk policies and procedures  exceptions to risk limits  new products and business ventures  and transactions with risk elements undergo a thorough review that is overseen by the business segment risk committees and ultimately by the firm risk committee 
the following is a discussion of the company s risk management policies and procedures for its principal risks other than liquidity and funding risk 
the discussion focuses on the company s securities activities primarily its institutional trading activities and consumer lending and related activities 
the company believes that these activities generate a substantial portion of its principal risks 
this discussion and the estimated amounts of the company s market risk exposure generated by the company s statistical analyses are forward looking statements 
however  the analyses used to assess such risks are not predictions of future events  and actual results may vary significantly from such analyses due to events in the markets in which the company operates and certain other factors described below 
market risk 
market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices  rates  indices  implied volatilities the price volatility of the underlying instrument imputed from option prices  correlations or other market factors  such as liquidity  will result in losses for a position or portfolio 
generally  the company incurs market risk as a result of trading and client facilitation activities  principally within the institutional securities business where the substantial majority of the company s value at risk var for market risk exposures is generated 
in addition  the company incurs trading related market risk within the individual investor group and investment management businesses 
the company also incurs non trading related market risk principally through its consumer lending activities within the credit services business 
sound market risk management is an integral part of the company s culture 
the various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are well managed and prudent 
the control groups help ensure that these risks are measured and closely monitored and are made transparent to senior management 
the market risk department is responsible for ensuring transparency of material market risks  monitoring compliance with established limits  and escalating risk concentrations to appropriate senior management 
to execute these responsibilities  the market risk department monitors the company s risk against limits on aggregate risk exposures  performs a variety of risk analyses  routinely reports risk summaries logo 
table of contents and maintains the company s var system 
a variety of limits are designed to control price and liquidity risk 
market risk is monitored through various measures statistically using var and related analytical measures  by measures of position sensitivity  and through routine stress testing and scenario analyses conducted by the market risk department in collaboration with the business units 
the material risks identified by these processes are summarized in reports produced by the market risk department that are circulated to  and discussed with  senior management 
sales and trading and related activities 
primary market risk exposures and market risk management 
during fiscal  the company had exposures to a wide range of interest rates  equity prices  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices and the associated implied volatilities and spreads related to the global markets in which it conducts its trading activities 
the company is exposed to interest rate and credit spread risk as a result of its market making activities and proprietary trading in interest rate sensitive financial instruments eg  risk arising from changes in the level or implied volatility of interest rates  the timing of mortgage prepayments  the shape of the yield curve and credit spreads 
the company is exposed to equity price and implied volatility risk as a result of making markets in equity securities and derivatives and maintaining proprietary positions 
the company is exposed to foreign exchange rate and implied volatility risk as a result of making markets in foreign currencies and foreign currency options and from maintaining foreign exchange positions 
the company is exposed to commodity price and implied volatility risk as a result of market making activities and maintaining positions in physical commodities such as crude and refined oil products  natural gas  electricity  and precious and base metals and related derivatives 
the company manages its trading positions by employing a variety of risk mitigation strategies 
these strategies include diversification of risk exposures and hedging 
hedging activities consist of the purchase or sale of positions in related securities and financial instruments  including a variety of derivative products eg  futures  forwards  swaps and options 
the company manages the market risk associated with its trading activities on a company wide basis  on a worldwide trading division level and on an individual product basis 
the company manages and monitors its market risk exposures in such a way as to maintain a portfolio that the company believes is well diversified in the aggregate with respect to market risk factors and that reflects the company s aggregate risk tolerance as established by the company s senior management 
aggregate market risk limits have been approved for the company and for its major trading divisions worldwide equity and fixed income  which includes interest rate products  credit products  foreign exchange and commodities 
additional market risk limits are assigned to trading desks and  as appropriate  products and regions 
trading division risk managers  desk risk managers  traders and the market risk department monitor market risk measures against limits in accordance with policies set by senior management 
the market risk department independently reviews the company s trading portfolios on a regular basis from a market risk perspective utilizing var and other quantitative and qualitative risk measures and analyses 
the company s trading businesses and the market risk department also use  as appropriate  measures such as sensitivity to changes in interest rates  prices  implied volatilities and time decay to monitor and report market risk exposures 
stress testing  which measures the impact on the value of existing portfolios of specified changes in market factors for certain products  is performed periodically and is reviewed by trading division risk managers  desk risk managers and the market risk department 
the market risk department also conducts scenario analyses  which estimate the company s revenue sensitivity to a set of specific  predefined market and geopolitical events 
value at risk var 
the company uses the statistical technique known as var as one of the tools used to measure  monitor and review the market risk exposures of its trading portfolios 
the market risk department calculates and distributes daily var based risk measures to various levels of management 
logo 
table of contents var methodology  assumptions and limitations 
the company estimates var using a model based on historical simulation for major market risk factors and monte carlo simulation for name specific risk in certain equity and fixed income exposures 
historical simulation involves constructing a distribution of hypothetical daily changes in the value of trading portfolios based on two sets of inputs historical observation of daily changes in key market indices or other market factors market risk factors  and information on the sensitivity of the portfolio values to these market risk factor changes 
the company s var model uses approximately four years of historical data to characterize potential changes in market risk factors 
the company s one day var corresponds to the unrealized loss in portfolio value that  based on historically observed market risk factor movements  would have been exceeded with a frequency of  or once in every trading days  if the portfolio were held constant for one day 
the company s var model generally takes into account linear and non linear exposures to price risk and linear exposures to implied volatility risks 
market risks that are incorporated in the var model include equity and commodity prices  interest rates  foreign exchange rates and associated implied volatilities 
as a supplement to the use of historical simulation for major market risk factors  the company s var model uses monte carlo simulation to capture name specific risk in equities and credit products ie  corporate bonds and credit derivatives 
the company s var models evolve over time in response to changes in the composition of trading portfolios and to improvements in modeling techniques and systems capabilities 
as part of regular process improvement  additional systematic and name specific risk factors may be added to improve the var model s ability to more accurately estimate risks to specific asset classes or industry sectors 
among their benefits  var models permit estimation of a portfolio s aggregate market risk exposure  incorporating a range of varied market risks  reflect risk reduction due to portfolio diversification or hedging activities  and can cover a wide range of portfolio assets 
however  var risk measures should be interpreted carefully in light of the methodology s limitations  which include the following past changes in market risk factors may not always yield accurate predictions of the distributions and correlations of future market movements  changes in portfolio value in response to market movements especially for complex derivative portfolios may differ from the responses calculated by a var model  var using a one day time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or hedged within one day  the historical market risk factor data used for var estimation may provide only limited insight into losses that could be incurred under market conditions that are unusual relative to the historical period used in estimating the var  and published var results reflect past trading positions while future risk depends on future positions 
the company is aware of these and other limitations and  therefore  uses var as only one component in its risk management oversight process 
as explained above  this process also incorporates stress testing and scenario analyses and extensive risk monitoring  analysis  and control at the trading desk  division and company levels 
var for fiscal the table below presents the company s var for each of the company s primary market risk exposures and on an aggregate basis at november  and november   incorporating substantially all financial instruments generating market risk that are managed by the company s trading businesses 
this measure of var incorporates most of the company s trading related market risks 
however  a small proportion of trading positions generating market risk is not included in var eg  certain credit default baskets  and the modeling of the risk characteristics of some positions relies upon approximations that  under certain circumstances  could produce significantly different var results from those produced using more precise measures 
for example  risks associated with residential mortgage backed securities have been approximated as it is difficult to capture precisely these risks within a var context 
aggregate trading and non trading var also incorporates a the funding liabilities related to institutional trading positions and b public company equity positions recorded as principal investments by the company 
principal investments made by the company that are not publicly traded are not reflected in the var results reported below 
as of november   the aggregate carrying value of such investments was approximately million 
logo 
table of contents since the var statistics reported below are estimates based on historical position and market data  var should not be viewed as predictive of the company s future revenues or financial performance or its ability to monitor and manage risk 
there can be no assurance that the company s actual losses on a particular day will not exceed the var amounts indicated below or that such losses will not occur more than once in trading days 
the table below presents var for each of the company s primary risk exposures and on an aggregate basis at november  and november  trading and non trading trading table aggregate var one day var at november  one day var at november  primary market risk category dollars in millions interest rate and credit spread equity price foreign exchange rate commodity price subtotal less diversification benefit aggregate var diversification benefit equals the difference between aggregate var and the sum of the vars for the four risk categories 
this benefit arises because the simulated one day losses for each of the four primary market risk categories occur on different days  similar diversification benefits also are taken into account within each category 
the company s aggregate trading and non trading var  and aggregate trading var at november  were million and million  respectively 
the company views average var over the fiscal year as more representative of trends in the business than var at any single point in time 
table below  which presents the high  low and average one day aggregate trading var over the course of fiscal and fiscal  represents substantially all of the company s trading activities 
certain market risks included in the year end aggregate trading and non trading var discussed above are excluded from these measures eg  equity price risk in public company equity positions recorded as principal investments by the company and certain funding liabilities related to trading positions 
average aggregate trading var for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal  reflecting an increase in all primary risk categories except foreign exchange 
the increase in interest rate and credit spread var was predominantly driven by increased exposures to credit sensitive instruments eg  corporate debt securities and to interest rate levels 
the increase in equity price var was predominantly driven by increased directional exposure to global equity markets 
the increase in commodity price var was predominantly driven by increased exposures to oil products

table of contents var statistics for comparisons with other global financial services firms var statistics are not readily comparable across firms because firms differ in the statistical assumptions they make when simulating changes in market factors as well as in the methods they use to approximate the portfolio revaluations under the simulations 
these differences can result in materially different var estimates for similar portfolios 
as a result  var statistics are more reliable and relevant when used as indicators of trends in risk taking within a firm rather than as a basis for inferring differences in risk taking across firms 
table below presents the var statistics that would result if the company were to adopt alternative parameters for its calculations  such as the reported confidence level vs 
for the var statistic or a shorter historical time series four years vs 
one year for market data upon which it bases its simulations table average and trading var with four year one year historical time series average one day var average one day var for fiscal for fiscal primary market risk category four year factor history one year factor history four year factor history one year factor history dollars in millions interest rate and credit spread equity price foreign exchange rate commodity price aggregate trading var in addition  if the company were to report trading var using a four year historical time series with respect to a day holding period  the company s and average aggregate trading var for fiscal would have been million and million  respectively 
logo 
table of contents distribution of var statistics and net revenues for as shown in table above  the company s average one day aggregate trading var for fiscal was million 
around this average  the company s aggregate trading var varied from day to day 
the histogram below presents the distribution of the company s daily one day aggregate trading var and illustrates that for more than of fiscal trading days  aggregate trading var ranged between million and million 
logo one method of evaluating the reasonableness of the company s var model as a measure of the company s potential volatility of net revenue is to compare the var with actual trading revenue 
assuming no intra day trading  for a one day var  the expected number of times that trading losses should exceed var during the fiscal year is three  and  in general  if trading losses were to exceed var more than five times in a year  the accuracy of the var model could be questioned 
accordingly  the company evaluates the reasonableness of its var model by comparing the potential declines in portfolio values generated by the model with actual trading results 
the histogram below shows the distribution of daily net revenue during fiscal for the company s trading businesses including net interest and commissions but excluding primary and prime brokerage revenue credited to the trading businesses 
there were no days during fiscal in which the company incurred daily trading losses in its trading businesses in excess of the one day aggregate trading var 
logo 
table of contents logo consumer lending and related activities 
interest rate risk and management 
in its consumer lending activities  the company is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates 
such changes in interest rates impact interest earning assets  principally credit card and other consumer loans and net excess servicing fees received in connection with consumer loans sold through asset securitizations  as well as the interest sensitive liabilities that finance these assets  including asset backed securitizations  long term borrowings  deposits and federal funds 
the company s interest rate risk management policies are designed to reduce the potential volatility of earnings that may arise from changes in interest rates by having a financing portfolio that reflects the existing repricing schedules of consumer loans as well as the company s right  with notice to cardmembers  to reprice certain fixed rate consumer loans to a new interest rate in the future 
to the extent that asset and related financing repricing characteristics of a particular portfolio are not matched effectively  the company utilizes interest rate derivative contracts  such as swap agreements  to achieve its objectives 
interest rate swap agreements effectively convert the underlying asset or financing from fixed to variable repricing or from variable to fixed repricing 
sensitivity analysis methodology  assumptions and limitations 
for its consumer lending activities  the company uses a variety of techniques to assess its interest rate risk exposure  one of which is interest rate sensitivity simulation 
for purposes of presenting the possible earnings effect of a hypothetical  adverse change in interest rates over the month period from its fiscal year end  the company assumes that all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be impacted by a hypothetical  immediate basis point increase in interest rates as of the beginning of the period 
interest rate sensitive assets are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next month period 
a portion of the company s credit card receivables has a fixed interest rate  although the company has the right  with notice to cardmembers  to subsequently reprice these receivables to a new interest rate 
therefore  the company considers the receivables with a fixed interest rate to be interest rate sensitive 
the company measured the earnings sensitivity for these assets from the expected repricing date  which takes into logo 
table of contents consideration the required notice period and billing cycles 
in addition  assets that have a market based index  such as the prime rate  which will reset before the end of the month period  or assets with rates that are fixed at fiscal year end but which will mature  or otherwise contractually reset to a market based indexed or other fixed rate prior to the end of the month period  are rate sensitive 
the latter category includes certain credit card loans that may be offered at below market rates for an introductory period  such as for balance transfers and special promotional programs  after which the loans will contractually reprice in accordance with the company s normal market based pricing structure 
for purposes of measuring rate sensitivity for such loans  only the effect of the hypothetical basis point change in the underlying market based indexed or other fixed rate has been considered rather than the full change in the rate to which the loan would contractually reprice 
for assets that have a fixed interest rate at fiscal year end but which contractually will  or are assumed to  reset to a market based indexed or other fixed rate during the next months  earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date 
in addition  for all interest rate sensitive assets  earnings sensitivity is calculated net of expected loan losses 
interest rate sensitive liabilities are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next month period 
thus  liabilities that have a market based index  such as the commercial paper or libor rates  which will reset before the end of the month period  or liabilities whose rates are fixed at fiscal year end but which will mature and are assumed to be replaced with a market based indexed rate prior to the end of the month period  are rate sensitive 
for these fixed rate liabilities  earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date 
assuming a hypothetical  immediate basis point increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities as of november   it is estimated that the pre tax income of consumer lending and related activities over the following month period would be reduced by approximately million 
the comparable reduction of pre tax income for the month period following november  was estimated to be approximately million 
the increase in the reduction in pre tax income at november  was due to a higher level of variable rate financing  as fixed financings matured 
the increase is partially offset by a higher level of variable interest rate assets as compared with the prior year period 
the hypothetical model assumes that the balances of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at fiscal year end will remain constant over the next month period 
it does not assume any growth  strategic change in business focus  change in asset pricing philosophy or change in asset liability funding mix 
thus  this model represents a static analysis that cannot adequately portray how the company would respond to significant changes in market conditions 
furthermore  the analysis does not necessarily reflect the company s expectations regarding the movement of interest rates in the near term  including the likelihood of an immediate basis point change in market interest rates  nor necessarily the actual effect on earnings if such rate changes were to occur 
credit risk 
credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising from borrower or counterparty default when a borrower  counterparty or obligor is unable to meet its financial obligations 
the company is exposed to three distinct types of credit risk in its businesses 
the company incurs significant  single name credit risk exposure through the institutional securities business 
this type of risk requires significant credit analysis of specific counterparties  both initially and on an ongoing basis 
the company incurs consumer portfolio credit risk in the credit services business primarily through cardholder receivables 
credit risk in a pool of credit card receivables is generally highly diversified  without significant individual exposures  and  accordingly  is managed on a portfolio and not a single name basis 
the company incurs individual consumer credit risk in the individual investor group business through margin loans to individual investors and loans to small businesses  both of which are generally collateralized 
the company has structured its credit risk management framework to reflect that each of these businesses generates unique credit risks that are appropriately managed separately 
the institutional credit department institutional credit manages credit risk exposure for the institutional securities business 
institutional credit is responsible for logo 
table of contents ensuring transparency of material credit risks  ensuring compliance with established limits  approving material extensions of credit  and escalating risk concentrations to appropriate senior management 
credit risk exposure in the individual investor group business is managed through various credit risk departments and committees 
the individual investor group risk management department is responsible for monitoring  measuring and analyzing credit risk exposures  including margin loans and credit sensitive  higher risk transactions 
credit risk exposure in the credit services business is managed through the credit services credit and market risk committee  which is  in turn  supported by business line specific risk committees and the credit risk management department  which is responsible for the development  validation and implementation of credit policy criteria  for predictive models and for monitoring performance for both new and existing products and overseeing adherence to existing policies and limits 
institutional securities activities 
lending 
in connection with certain of its institutional securities business activities  the company provides loans or lending commitments including bridge financing to selected clients 
these loans and commitments have varying terms  may be senior or subordinated  are generally contingent upon representations  warranties and contractual conditions applicable to the borrower  and may be syndicated or traded by the company 
the borrowers may be rated investment grade or non investment grade 
credit risk with respect to loans and lending commitments arises from the failure of a borrower to perform according to the terms of the loan agreement 
securitized products 
the company also extends loans and lending commitments to clients that are secured by assets of the borrower and generally provide for over collateralization  including commercial real estate  loans secured by loan pools  corporate and operating company loans  and secured lines of revolving credit 
credit risk with respect to these loans and lending commitments arises from the failure of a borrower to perform according to the terms of the loan agreement and a decline in collateral value 
other 
in addition to the activities performed by institutional credit  there are credit risks managed by various business areas within institutional securities 
for example  certain businesses with heightened settlement risk monitor compliance with established settlement risk limits 
certain risk management activities for the company s prime brokerage and securitized product businesses are primarily monitored within those areas in that they determine the appropriate collateral level for each strategy or position 
in addition  a collateral management group monitors collateral levels against requirements and oversees the administration of the collateral function 
derivative contracts 
in the normal course of business  the company enters into a variety of derivative contracts related to financial instruments and commodities 
the company uses these instruments for trading and investment purposes  as well as for asset and liability management 
these instruments generally represent future commitments to swap interest payment streams  exchange currencies  or purchase or sell commodities and other financial instruments on specific terms at specified future dates 
many of these products have maturities that do not extend beyond one year  although swaps  options and warrants on equities typically have longer maturities 
the company incurs credit risk as a dealer in otc derivatives 
credit risk with respect to derivative instruments arises from the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of the contract 
the company s exposure to credit risk at any point in time is represented by the fair value of the derivative contracts reported as assets 
the fair value of derivatives represents the amount at which the derivative could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties  other than in a forced or liquidation sale  and is further described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
future changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  or the fair values of the financial instruments  commodities  or indices underlying these contracts ultimately may result in cash settlements exceeding fair value amounts recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
analyzing credit risk 
credit risk management takes place at the transaction  counterparty and portfolio levels 
in order to help protect the company from losses resulting from these activities  institutional credit ensures that all material lending and derivative transactions are prudently analyzed prior to approval  that the creditworthiness of logo 
table of contents the company s counterparties and borrowers is reviewed regularly  and that credit exposure is actively monitored and managed 
institutional credit assigns obligor credit ratings to the company s counterparties and borrowers 
these credit ratings are intended to assess a counterparty s probability of default and are derived using methodologies generally consistent with those employed by external rating agencies 
credit ratings of bb or below are considered non investment grade 
additionally  institutional credit assigns a facility rating to lending facilities 
the facility rating incorporates the relative position of the particular obligation in the borrower s capital structure and relative recovery prospects 
the company has credit guidelines that limit potential credit exposure to any one borrower or counterparty and to aggregates of borrowers or counterparties by type of business activity 
institutional credit administers these limits and monitors and reports credit exposure relative to limits 
risk mitigation 
the company may seek to mitigate credit risk from its lending and derivatives transactions in multiple ways 
at the transaction level  the company seeks to mitigate risk through management of key risk elements such as size  tenor  seniority and collateral 
the company actively hedges its lending and derivatives exposure through various financial instruments which may include single name  portfolio and structured credit derivatives 
additionally  the company may sell  assign  or sub participate lending commitments and funded loans to other financial institutions in the primary and secondary loan market 
in connection with its derivatives trading activities  the company may enter into master netting agreements and collateral arrangements with counterparties 
these agreements may provide the company with the ability to offset a counterparty s rights and obligations  request additional collateral when necessary or liquidate the collateral in the event of counterparty default 
credit exposure lending 
at november  and november   the aggregate value of investment grade loans and positions was billion and billion  respectively  and the aggregate value of non investment grade loans and positions was billion and billion  respectively 
at november  and november   the aggregate value of lending commitments outstanding was billion and billion  respectively 
in connection with these business activities which include funded loans and lending commitments  the company had hedges with a notional amount of billion and billion at november  and november   respectively  including both internal and external hedges utilized by the lending business
