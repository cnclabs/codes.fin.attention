item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting policies accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities  financial condition hedging instruments as well as note to our financial statements included in item derivative instruments and hedging activities 
under the reit rules of the internal revenue code  some hedging activities produce income that is not qualifying income for purposes of the reit gross income tests or create assets that are not qualifying assets for purposes of the reit assets test 
as a result  we may have to terminate certain hedging activities before the benefits of such activities are realized 
in the case of excess hedging income  we would be required to pay a penalty tax for failure to satisfy certain reit income tests under the internal revenue code if the excess is 
table of contents due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect 
if we had excess hedging income in relation to our mortgage related assets  the penalty would result in our disqualification as a reit 
in addition  asset liability management involves transaction costs that increase dramatically as the period covered by hedging protection increases and that may increase during periods of fluctuating interest rates 
prepayment risk management 
we also seek to lessen the effects of prepayment of mortgage loans underlying our securities at a faster or slower rate than anticipated 
we expect to accomplish this objective by using a variety of techniques that include  without limitation  structuring a diversified portfolio with a variety of prepayment characteristics  investing in mortgage backed securities based on mortgage loans with prepayment prohibitions and penalties  investing in certain mortgage security structures that have prepayment protections and purchasing mortgage backed securities at a premium and at a discount 
we monitor prepayment risk through the periodic review of the impact of a variety of prepayment scenarios on our revenues  net earnings  distributions  cash flow and net balance sheet market value 
we believe that we have developed cost effective asset liability management policies to mitigate interest rate and prepayment risks 
we monitor our risk management strategies on a regular basis as market conditions change 
however  no strategy can completely insulate us from interest rate and prepayment risks 
further  as noted above  certain of the us federal income tax requirements that we must satisfy to qualify as a reit limit our ability to fully hedge our interest rate and prepayment risks 
therefore  we could be prevented from effectively hedging our interest rate and prepayment risks 
description of mortgage related assets mortgage backed securities pass through certificates 
we expect to invest principally in pass through certificates  which are securities representing interests in pools of mortgage loans secured by residential real property in which payments of both interest and principal on the securities are generally made monthly 
in effect  these securities pass through the monthly payments made by the individual borrowers on the mortgage loans that underlie the securities  net of fees paid to the issuer or guarantor of the securities 
pass through certificates can be divided into various categories based on the characteristics of the underlying mortgages  such as the term or whether the interest rate is fixed or variable 
a key feature of most mortgage loans is the ability of the borrower to repay principal earlier than scheduled  which we refer to as a prepayment 
prepayments can arise due to sale of the underlying property  refinancing  foreclosure or other events 
prepayments result in a return of principal to pass through certificate holders 
this return may result in a lower or higher rate of return upon reinvestment of principal  and is generally referred to as prepayment uncertainty 
if a security purchased at a premium prepays at a higher than expected rate  then the value of the premium would be eroded at a faster than expected rate 
similarly  if a discount mortgage prepays at a lower than expected rate  the amortization towards par would be accumulated at a slower than expected rate 
we refer to the possibility of these undesirable effects as prepayment risk 
in general  but not always  declining interest rates tend to increase prepayments  and rising interest rates tend to slow prepayments 
like other fixed income securities  when interest rates rise  the value of mortgage backed securities generally decline 
the rate of prepayments on underlying mortgages will affect the price and volatility of mortgage backed securities and may have the effect of shortening or extending the effective maturity of the security beyond what was anticipated at the time of purchase 
if interest rates rise  our holdings of mortgage backed securities may experience reduced returns if the borrowers of the underlying mortgages pay off their mortgages later than anticipated  which we refer to as extension risk 
payment of limited amounts of principal and interest on some mortgage pass through securities  although not the market value of the securities themselves  may be guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the federal government  including securities backed by ginnie mae  or by agencies or instrumentalities of the federal government  including fannie mae or freddie mac 
mortgage backed securities created by non governmental issuers  including commercial banks  savings and loan institutions  private mortgage insurance companies  mortgage bankers and other secondary market issuers  may be supported by various forms of insurance or 
table of contents guarantees  including individual loan  title  pool and hazard insurance and letters of credit  which may be issued by governmental entities  private insurers or the mortgage poolers 
the mortgage loans underlying pass through certificates can generally be classified in the following four categories adjustable rate mortgages 
adjustable rate mortgages  or arms  are those for which the borrower pays an interest rate that varies over the term of the loan 
the interest rate usually resets based on market interest rates  although the adjustment of such an interest rate may be subject to certain limitations 
traditionally  interest rate resets occur at fixed intervals for example  once per year 
we refer to such arms as traditional arms 
because the interest rates on arms fluctuate based on market conditions  arms tend to have interest rates that do not deviate from current market rates by a large amount 
arms may therefore have less price sensitivity to interest rates 
fixed rate mortgages 
fixed rate mortgages are those where the borrower pays an interest rate that is constant throughout the term of the loan 
traditionally  most fixed rate mortgages have an original term of years 
however  shorter terms also referred to as final maturity dates have become common in recent years 
because the interest rate on the loan never changes  even when market interest rates change  over time there can be a divergence between the interest rate on the loan and current market interest rates  which in turn can make a fixed rate mortgage s price sensitive to market fluctuations in interest rates 
in general  the longer the remaining term on the mortgage loan  the greater the price sensitivity 
one way to attempt to lower the price sensitivity of a portfolio of fixed rate mortgages is to buy those with shorter remaining terms or maturities 
hybrid adjustable rate mortgages 
a recent development in the mortgage market has been the popularity of arms that do not reset at regular intervals 
many of these arms have a fixed rate for the first few years of the loan typically three  five  seven or years and thereafter reset periodically like a traditional arm 
effectively such mortgages are hybrids  combining the features of a pure fixed rate mortgage and a traditional arm 
hybrid arms have a price sensitivity to interest rates similar to that of a fixed rate mortgage during the period when the interest rate is fixed and similar to that of an arm when the interest rate is in its periodic reset stage 
however  because many hybrid arms are structured with a relatively short initial time span during which the interest rate is fixed  even during that segment of its existence  the price sensitivity may be low 
balloon maturity mortgages 
balloon maturity mortgages are a type of fixed rate mortgage 
thus  they have a static interest rate for the life of the loan 
however the term of the loan is usually quite short and is less than the amortization schedule of the loan 
typically  this term or maturity is less than seven years 
when the mortgage matures  the investor receives all of his principal back  which effectively is a price reset of the invested principal to par 
as the balloon maturity mortgage approaches its maturity date  the price sensitivity of the mortgage declines 
in fact  the price sensitivity for an agency balloon mortgage with a set maturity is actually lower than that for an agency hybrid arm with the same time to interest rate reset 
collateralized mortgage obligations 
collateralized mortgage obligations  or cmos  are a type of mortgage backed security 
interest and principal on a cmo are paid  in most cases  on a monthly basis 
cmos may be collateralized by whole mortgage loans  but are more typically collateralized by portfolios of mortgage pass through securities guaranteed by fannie mae  freddie mac or ginnie mae 
cmos are structured into multiple classes  or tranches  with each class bearing a different stated maturity 
monthly payments of principal  including prepayments  are first returned to investors holding the shortest maturity class  investors holding the longer maturity classes receive principal only after the first class has been retired 
generally  fixed rate mortgages are used to collateralize cmos 
however  the cmo tranches need not all have fixed rate coupons 
some cmo tranches have floating rate coupons that adjust based on market interest rates  subject to some limitations 
such tranches  often called cmo floaters  can have relatively low price sensitivity 

table of contents mortgage derivative securities 
we may acquire mortgage derivative securities in an amount not to exceed of our total assets 
mortgage derivative securities allow the holder to receive interest only  principal only or interest and principal in amounts that are disproportionate to those payable on the underlying mortgage loans 
payments on mortgage derivative securities can be highly sensitive to the rate of prepayments on the underlying mortgage loans 
in the event of faster or slower than anticipated prepayments on these mortgage loans  the rates of return on interests in mortgage derivative securities representing the right to receive interest only or a disproportionately large amount of interest  or interest only derivatives  would be likely to decline or increase  respectively 
conversely  the rates of return on mortgage derivative securities representing the right to receive principal only or a disproportionate amount of principal  or principal only derivatives  would be likely to increase or decrease in the event of faster or slower prepayment speeds  respectively 
we may also invest in inverse floaters  a class of cmos with a coupon rate that resets in the opposite direction from the market rate of interest to which it is indexed  including libor or the th district cost of funds index  or cofi 
any rise in the index rate  which can be caused by an increase in interest rates  causes a drop in the coupon rate of an inverse floater while any drop in the index rate causes an increase in the coupon rate of an inverse floater 
an inverse floater may behave like a leveraged security since its interest rate usually varies by a magnitude much greater than the magnitude of the index rate of interest 
the leverage like characteristics inherent in inverse floaters are associated with greater volatility in their market prices 
we may also invest in other mortgage derivative securities that may be developed in the future 
subordinated interests 
we may also acquire subordinated interests  which are classes of mortgage backed securities that are junior to other classes of the same series of mortgage backed securities in the right to receive payments from the underlying mortgage loans 
the subordination may be for all payment failures on the mortgage loans securing or underlying such series of mortgage securities 
the subordination will not be limited to those resulting from particular types of risks  including those resulting from war  earthquake or flood  or the bankruptcy of a borrower 
the subordination may be for the entire amount of the series of mortgage related securities or may be limited in amount 
mortgage loans we may acquire and accumulate mortgage loans ie  fixed rate  arms  hybrid and balloon mortgage loans as part of our investment strategy until a sufficient quantity has been accumulated for securitization into high quality mortgage backed securities in order to enhance their value and liquidity 
pursuant to our asset acquisition policy  the aggregate amount of any mortgage loans that we acquire and do not immediately securitize  together with our investments in other mortgage related assets that are not category i or category ii assets  will not constitute more than of our total assets at any time 
all mortgage loans  if any  will be acquired with the intention of securitizing them into high credit quality mortgage securities 
despite our intentions  however  we may not be successful in securitizing these mortgage loans 
to meet our investment criteria  mortgage loans we acquire will generally conform to underwriting guidelines consistent with high quality mortgages 
applicable banking laws generally require that an appraisal be obtained in connection with the original issuance of mortgage loans by the lending institution 
we do not intend to obtain additional appraisals if we acquire any mortgage loans 
mortgage loans may be originated by or purchased from various suppliers of mortgage related assets throughout the united states  including savings and loans associations  banks  mortgage bankers and other mortgage lenders 
we may acquire mortgage loans directly from originators and from entities holding mortgage loans originated by others 
our board of directors has not established any limits upon the geographic concentration of mortgage loans that we may acquire 
however  our asset acquisition policy limits the amount and or type of mortgage loans we may acquire 
other investments we may acquire other investments that include equity and debt securities issued primarily by other mortgage related finance companies  interests in mortgage related collateralized bond obligations  other 
table of contents subordinated interests in pools of mortgage related assets  commercial mortgage loans and securities and residential mortgage loans other than high credit quality mortgage loans 
these investments are generally considered category iii investments under our asset acquisition policy and are limited to of our total assets 
we also intend to operate in a manner that will not subject us to regulation under the investment company act of our board of directors has the authority to modify or waive our current operating policies and our strategies without prior notice to you and without stockholder approval 
investment strategy our strategy is to invest primarily in us agency and other highly rated single family adjustable rate and fixed rate mortgage backed securities 
we acquire these investments in the secondary market and seek to acquire assets that will produce competitive returns after considering the amount and nature of the anticipated returns from the investment  our ability to pledge the investment for secured  collateralized borrowings and the costs associated with financing  managing  securitizing and reserving for these investments 
we do not construct our overall investment portfolio in order to express a directional expectation for interest rates or mortgage prepayment rates 
future interest rates and mortgage prepayment rates are difficult to predict and  as a result  we seek to acquire mortgage backed securities that we believe provide acceptable returns over a broad range of interest rate and prepayment scenarios 
when evaluating the purchase of mortgage backed securities  we analyze whether the purchase will permit us to continue to satisfy the minimum portfolio whole pool requirement  with which we must comply to maintain our reit status 
we also assess the relative value of the mortgage backed security and how well it would fit into our existing portfolio of mortgage backed securities 
many aspects of a mortgage backed security  and the dynamic interaction of its characteristics with those of our portfolio  can influence our perception of what that security is worth and the amount of premium we would be willing to pay to own the specific security 
the characteristics of each potential investment we analyze generally include  but are not limited to  the following origination year the underwriting year for the mortgages comprising the mortgage backed security 
this characteristic helps to determine how seasoned the mortgage backed security is and can influence our expectations for the investment s future cash flows 
in the current low interest rate environment  mortgages that were originated several years ago when interest rates were higher tend to have been refinanced 
those borrowers who did not refinance their homes during the period of lower interest rates may be relatively less likely than more recent borrowers to refinance during the remaining life of their mortgages 
therefore  the expected cash flows from a potential investment with an earlier origination year could exhibit less sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
originator the financial services entity that underwrites the mortgages comprising the mortgage backed security 
originators do not have homogeneous underwriting standards 
the particular underwriting standards utilized by an originator tend to influence the characteristics of the borrowers in its mortgage loan pools which  in turn  can influence the pool s prepayment rates and other cash flows 
when analyzing a pool of mortgages  it can be useful to review the historical cash flows exhibited by the originator s prior mortgage loan pools 
for example  we may limit the premium we would be willing to pay for a security if the originator has a history of early refinancings 
the quality of the originator s underwriting standards and the terms it offers borrowers can also be important to our purchase decisions 
these variables potentially include the originator s required loan documentation  fico scores  loan to value ratios  prepayment penalties  cap rates and assumability terms 
any of these variables might influence our expectations regarding the timing of cash flows from an originator s mortgage backed securities and  thus  their attractiveness for our portfolio 
coupon the weighted average mortgage coupon of the mortgage backed security 
higher coupons are initially attractive because they can generate more interest income for us than lower coupon mortgage backed securities 
however  the sustainability of cash flows from higher coupon pools is less predictable because  all else being equal  higher coupon mortgages have a greater probability of being refinanced than lower coupon mortgages 
we generally analyze a mortgage backed security s coupon 
table of contents in comparison to current market rates to form an expectation regarding how sustainable the interest income from the investment will be 
margin the spread between an adjustable rate mortgage s market index and the interest rate that the borrower must pay to service the mortgage 
similar to higher coupons  higher margins are attractive because they can generate more interest income for us than lower margin mortgage backed securities 
however  higher margin mortgage pools may be more prone to experience faster refinancing rates because high margin borrowers are relatively more likely to find opportunities to refinance into mortgages with lower spreads to the index 
as a result  the sustainability of the yield from an investment in a high margin mortgage pool is less certain and the premium we would be willing to pay on such an investment  all else being equal  is less 
periodic cap the amount by which the interest rate on an adjustable rate mortgage can adjust during a specified period  usually six or months 
in rapidly rising interest rate environments  higher periodic caps are more attractive because they reduce the risk of the adjustable rate mortgage coupon not being able to reset fully upwards to the current market rate 
conversely  in rapidly falling interest rate environments  lower periodic caps increase the probability that the mortgage s coupon will reset to a level that remains above the current market rate 
lifetime cap the maximum interest rate that a specific arm can have during its lifetime 
the lifetime cap of a mortgage is often correlated with market interest rates at the time of origination 
an arm originated in a low interest rate environment will frequently have a lower lifetime cap than a comparably structured mortgage originated in a high interest rate environment 
if interest rates rise sufficiently  an arm with a lifetime cap can effectively behave like a fixed rate mortgage because the coupon of the arm cannot adjust above the lifetime cap  and will thus remain effectively fixed at that level until rates fall 
higher lifetime caps tend to make particularly structured hybrid or adjustable rate mortgage pools more attractive investment candidates 
time to reset the number of months before the current coupon of the hybrid or adjustable rate mortgage will reset 
time to reset is an important consideration as we structure the timing of interest rate adjustments on the mortgage backed securities in our portfolio relative to changes in our borrowing costs 
loan to value the ratio between the original loan amount and the value of the collateral securing the mortgage loan 
we consider this factor less important in a decision to purchase agency backed mortgage securities but it can be an important factor when purchasing non agency securities 
this factor also influences the subordination levels required by the national rating agencies to receive aaa rated status 
geographic dispersion the degree to which the properties underlying the pooled mortgage loans are geographically dispersed 
we prefer greater geographic dispersion because we seek to limit our exposure to specific states or regions  which might be experiencing relatively greater economic difficulties  to create a more stable portfolio 
price and prepayment expectations the expected yield of the mortgage backed security under various assumptions about future economic conditions 
a mortgage backed security s ultimate yield is determined by its price and its actual prepayment levels 
we generally form expectations  based on the above factors  regarding how the mortgage pool s prepayment levels will change over time  including in response to possible changes in prevailing interest rates and other economic conditions  so as to determine whether its offered price creates a yield that is attractive and fits well with the expected structure of our portfolio and our borrowing costs under those scenarios 
we generally consider these factors when evaluating an investment s relative value and the impact it would likely have on our overall portfolio 
we do not assign a particular weight to any factor because the relative importance of the various factors varies  depending upon the characteristics we seek for our portfolio and our borrowing cost structure 

table of contents we do not currently originate mortgage loans or provide other types of financing to the owners of real estate and we do not service any mortgage loans 
however  in the future  we may elect to originate mortgage loans or other types of financing  and we may elect to service mortgage loans and other types of financing 
financing strategy we finance the acquisition of our mortgage backed securities with short term borrowings and term loans with a term of less than one year and  to a lesser extent  equity capital 
after analyzing the then applicable interest rate yield curves  we may finance with long term borrowings from time to time 
the amount of borrowing we employ depends on  among other factors  the amount of our equity capital 
we use leverage to attempt to increase potential returns to our stockholders 
pursuant to our capital liquidity and leverage policies  we seek to strike a balance between the under utilization of leverage  which reduces potential returns to our stockholders  and the over utilization of leverage  which increases risk by reducing our ability to meet our obligations to creditors during adverse market conditions 
we borrow at short term rates using repurchase agreements 
repurchase agreements are generally short term in nature 
we seek to actively manage the adjustment periods and the selection of the interest rate indices of our borrowings against the adjustment periods and the selection of indices on our mortgage backed securities in order to limit our liquidity and interest rate related risks 
we generally seek to diversify our exposure by entering into repurchase agreements with multiple lenders 
in addition  we only enter into repurchase agreements with institutions that we believe are financially sound and that meet credit standards approved by our board of directors 
growth strategy in addition to the strategies described above  we use other strategies to seek to generate earnings and distributions to our stockholders  including increasing the size of our balance sheet at a rate faster than the rate of increase in our operating expenses  using leverage to increase the size of our balance sheet  and lowering our effective borrowing costs over time by seeking direct funding with collateralized lenders 
industry trends the us residential mortgage market has experienced considerable growth over the past years  with total outstanding us residential mortgage debt growing from approximately trillion in to approximately trillion at september   according to the federal reserve board 
according to the same source  the total amount of us residential mortgage debt securitized into mortgage backed securities has grown from approximately trillion in to approximately trillion at september   approximately trillion of which was agency backed and therefore generally consistent with our investment guidelines 
at september   approximately billion of the available mortgage backed securities were held by reits 
competition when we invest in mortgage backed securities and other investment assets  we compete with a variety of institutional investors  including other reits  insurance companies  mutual funds  hedge funds  pension funds  investment banking firms  banks and other financial institutions that invest in the same types of assets 
many of these investors have greater financial resources and access to lower costs of capital than we do 
the existence of these competitive entities  as well as the possibility of additional entities forming in the future  may increase the competition for the acquisition of mortgage backed securities  resulting in higher prices and lower yields on assets 

table of contents certain united states federal income tax considerations the following discussion summarizes the material us federal income tax considerations regarding our qualification and taxation as a reit and the material us federal income tax consequences resulting from the acquisition  ownership and disposition of our common stock 
the following discussion is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations 
this summary neither gives a detailed discussion of any state  local or foreign tax considerations nor discusses all of the aspects of us federal income taxation that may be relevant to you in light of your particular circumstances or to particular types of stockholders that are subject to special tax rules  such as insurance companies  tax exempt entities  financial institutions or broker dealers  foreign corporations or partnerships  persons who are not citizens or residents of the united states  stockholders that hold our stock as a hedge  part of a straddle  conversion transaction or other arrangement involving more than one position  or stockholders whose functional currency is not the us dollar 
this discussion assumes that you will hold our common stock as a capital asset  generally property held for investment  under the internal revenue code 
you are urged to consult with your own tax advisor regarding the specific consequences to you of the purchase  ownership and sale of stock in an entity electing to be taxed as a reit  including the federal  state  local  foreign and other tax considerations of such purchase  ownership  sale and election and the potential changes in applicable tax laws 
recent tax legislation on october   the president signed into law the american jobs creation act of the jobs act  which amended certain rules relating to reits 
the relevant provisions of the jobs act are discussed in this section 
general we elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code commencing with our taxable year ending december  our qualification and taxation as a reit depend on our ability to continue to meet  through actual annual operating results  distribution levels  diversity of stock ownership  and the various other qualification tests imposed under the internal revenue code discussed below 
no assurance can be given that our actual results for any particular taxable year will satisfy these requirements 
see failure to qualify as a reit 
in addition  our continuing qualification as a reit depends on future transactions and events that cannot be known at this time 
so long as we qualify for taxation as a reit  we generally will be permitted a deduction for dividends we pay to our stockholders 
as a result  we generally will not be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on our net income that is currently distributed to our stockholders 
this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation that ordinarily results from investment in a corporation 
double taxation means taxation once at the corporate level when income is earned and once again at the stockholder level when this income is distributed 
we will be required to pay us federal income tax  however  as follows we will be required to pay tax at regular corporate rates on any undistributed reit taxable net income  including undistributed net capital gain  we may be required to pay the alternative minimum tax on our items of tax preference  and if we have net income from the sale or other disposition of foreclosure property which is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or other non qualifying income from foreclosure property  we will be required to pay tax at the highest corporate rate on this income 
foreclosure property is generally defined as property acquired through foreclosure or after a default on a loan secured by the property or on a lease of the property 
we will be required to pay a tax on any net income from prohibited transactions 
prohibited transactions are  in general  sales or other taxable dispositions of property  other than foreclosure property  held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business 
under existing law  whether property is 
table of contents held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction 
if we fail to satisfy the gross income test or the gross income test discussed below  but nonetheless maintain our qualification as a reit because certain other requirements including that our failure was due to reasonable cause are met  we will be subject to a tax equal to the greater of the amount by which of our gross income exceeds the amount qualifying under the gross income test described below  and the amount by which of our gross income exceeds the amount qualifying under the gross income test described below  multiplied by  a fraction intended to reflect our profitability 
pursuant to the jobs act  commencing with our taxable year beginning on january   if we fail to satisfy any of the reit asset tests  as described below  by more than a de minimis amount  due to reasonable cause and we nonetheless maintain our reit qualification because of specified cure provisions  we will be required to pay a tax equal to the greater of  or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by our net income generated by the nonqualifying assets 
pursuant to the jobs act  commencing with our taxable year beginning on january   if we fail to satisfy any provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit other than a violation of the reit gross income or asset tests described below and the violation is due to reasonable cause  we will retain our reit qualification but we will be required to pay a penalty of  for each such failure 
we will be required to pay a excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the amounts actually distributed if we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of of our real estate investment trust ordinary income for the year  of our real estate investment trust capital gain net income for the year  and any undistributed taxable income from prior periods 
this distribution requirement is in addition to  and different from the distribution requirements discussed below in the section entitled distributions generally 
if we acquire any asset from a corporation that is or has been taxed as a c corporation under the internal revenue code in a transaction in which the basis of the asset in our hands is determined by reference to the basis of the asset in the hands of the c corporation  and we subsequently recognize gain on the disposition of the asset during the year period beginning on the date on which we acquired the asset  then we will be required to pay tax at the highest regular corporate tax rate on this gain to the extent of the excess of the fair market value of the asset  over our adjusted basis in the asset  in each case determined as of the date on which we acquired the asset 
a c corporation is generally defined as a corporation required to pay full corporate level tax 
the results described in this paragraph with respect to the recognition of gain will apply unless we make an election under treasury regulation section d c to cause the c corporation to recognize all of the gain inherent in the property at the time of our acquisition of the asset 
finally  we could be subject to an excise tax if our dealings with any taxable reit subsidiaries are not at arm s length 
requirements for qualification as a reit the internal revenue code defines a reit as a corporation  trust or association that is managed by one or more trustees or directors  that issues transferable shares or transferable certificates to evidence beneficial ownership  
table of contents that would be taxable as a domestic corporation but for sections through of the internal revenue code  that is not a financial institution or an insurance company within the meaning of the internal revenue code  that is beneficially owned by or more persons  not more than in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned  actually or constructively  by five or fewer individuals  including specified entities  during the last half of each taxable year  and that meets other tests  described below  regarding the nature of its income and assets and the amount of its distributions 
the internal revenue code provides that all of the first four conditions stated above must be met during the entire taxable year and that the fifth condition must be met during at least days of a taxable year of months  or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than months 
stock ownership tests our stock must be beneficially held by at least persons  which we refer to as the stockholder rule  and no more than of the value of our stock may be owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of the taxable year  which we refer to as the rule 
in determining whether five or fewer individuals hold our shares  certain attribution rules of the internal revenue code apply 
for purposes of the rule  pension trusts and other specific tax exempt entities generally are treated as individuals  except that certain tax qualified pension funds are not considered individuals and beneficiaries of such trusts are treated as holding shares of a reit in proportion to their actuarial interests in the trust for purposes of the rule 
our charter imposes repurchase provisions and transfer restrictions to avoid having more than of the value of our stock being held by five or fewer individuals 
these stock ownership requirements must be satisfied in each taxable year 
we are required to solicit information from certain of our record stockholders to verify actual stock ownership levels  and our charter provides for restrictions regarding the transfer of our stock in order to aid in meeting the stock ownership requirements 
we will be treated as satisfying the rule if we comply with the demand letter and record keeping requirements discussed below  and if we do not know  and by exercising reasonable diligence would not have known  whether we failed to satisfy the rule 
we satisfied the stock ownership tests immediately following our initial public offering and we will use reasonable efforts to monitor our stock ownership in order to ensure continued compliance with these tests 
if we were to fail either of the stock ownership tests  we would generally be disqualified from reit status 
to monitor our compliance with the stock ownership tests  we are required to maintain records regarding the actual ownership of our shares of stock 
to do so  we are required to demand written statements each year from the record holders of certain percentages of our shares of stock in which the record holders are to disclose the actual owners of the shares ie  the persons required to include our dividends in gross income 
a reit with  or more record stockholders must demand statements from record holders of or more of its shares  one with fewer than  but more than  record stockholders must demand statements from record holders of or more of its shares  while a reit with or fewer record stockholders must demand statements from record holders of or more of its shares 
a list of those persons failing or refusing to comply with this demand must be maintained as part of our records 
a stockholder who fails or refuses to comply with the demand must submit a statement with his or her tax return disclosing the actual ownership of the shares of stock and certain other information 
income tests we must satisfy two gross income requirements annually to maintain our qualification as a reit under the gross income test  we must derive at least of our gross income  excluding gross income from prohibited transactions  from specified real estate sources  including rental income  
table of contents interest on obligations secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real property  gain from the disposition of qualified real estate assets  ie  interests in real property  mortgages secured by real property or interests in real property  and some other assets  and income from certain types of temporary investments  and under the gross income test  we must derive at least of our gross income  excluding gross income from prohibited transactions  from the sources of income that satisfy the gross income test  dividends  interest and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities  including some interest rate swap and cap agreements  options  futures and forward contracts entered into to hedge variable rate debt incurred to acquire qualified real estate assets  or any combination of the foregoing 
amounts from qualified hedges will generally not constitute gross income and therefore will be disregarded for purposes of the gross income test if certain identification and other requirements are satisfied  and will be treated as nonqualifying income for the and gross income tests if such requirements are not satisfied 
for purposes of the and gross income tests  a reit is deemed to have earned a proportionate share of the income earned by any partnership  or any limited liability company treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes  in which it owns an interest  which share is determined by reference to its capital interest in such entity  and is deemed to have earned the income earned by any qualified reit subsidiary in general  a owned corporate subsidiary of a reit 
any amount includable in our gross income with respect to a regular or residual interest in a remic generally also is treated as interest on an obligation secured by a mortgage on real property 
if  however  less than of the assets of a remic consists of real estate assets determined as if we held such assets  we will be treated as receiving directly our proportionate share of the income of the remic 
in addition  if we receive interest income with respect to a mortgage loan that is secured by both real property and other property and the highest principal amount of the loan outstanding during a taxable year exceeds the fair market value of the real property on the date we became committed to make or purchase the mortgage loan  a portion of the interest income  equal to such highest principal amount minus such value  divided by such highest principal amount  generally will not be qualifying income for purposes of the gross income test 
however  interest income received with respect to non remic pay through bonds and pass through debt instruments  such as collateralized mortgage obligations  or cmos  will not be qualifying income for this purpose 
interest earned by a reit ordinarily does not qualify as income meeting the or gross income tests if the determination of all or some of the amount of interest depends in any way on the income or profits of any person 
interest will not be disqualified from meeting such tests  however  solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales 
if we are entitled to avail ourselves of certain relief provisions pertaining to the income tests  we will maintain our qualification as a reit but will be subject to certain penalty taxes as described above 
we may not  however  be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions in all circumstances 
if these relief provisions do not apply to a particular set of circumstances  we will not qualify as a reit 
asset tests at the close of each quarter of our taxable year  we must satisfy four tests relating to the nature and diversification of our assets at least of the value of our total assets must be represented by qualified real estate assets  cash  cash items and government securities  not more than of our total assets may be represented by securities  other than those securities included in the asset test  of the investments included in the asset class  the value of any one issuer s securities may not exceed of the value of our total assets the asset test  and we generally may not own more 
table of contents than by vote or value of any one issuer s outstanding securities the asset test  in each case except with respect to stock of any taxable reit subsidiaries  and the value of the securities we own in any taxable reit subsidiaries may not exceed of the value of our total assets 
qualified real estate assets include interests in mortgages on real property to the extent the principal balance of a mortgage does not exceed the fair market value of the associated real property  regular or residual interests in a remic except that  if less than of the assets of a remic consists of real estate assets determined as if we held such assets  we will be treated as holding directly our proportionate share of the assets of such remic  and shares of other reits 
non remic cmos  however  do not qualify as qualified real estate assets for this purpose 
a taxable reit subsidiary is any corporation in which we own stock and as to which we and such corporation jointly elect to treat such corporation as a taxable reit subsidiary 
for purposes of the asset tests  we will be deemed to own a proportionate share of the assets of any partnership  or any limited liability company treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes  in which we own an interest  which share is determined by reference to our capital interest in the entity  and will be deemed to own the assets owned by any qualified reit subsidiary and any other entity that is disregarded for us federal income tax purposes 
after initially meeting the asset tests at the close of any quarter  we will not lose our status as a reit for failure to satisfy the asset tests at the end of a later quarter solely by reason of changes in asset values 
if we fail to satisfy the asset tests because we acquire securities or other property during a quarter  we can cure this failure by disposing of sufficient non qualifying assets within days after the close of that quarter 
for this purpose  an increase in our capital interest in any partnership or limited liability company in which we own an interest generally will be treated as an acquisition of a portion of the securities or other property owned by that partnership or limited liability company 
pursuant to the jobs act  commencing with our taxable year beginning on january   if we fail to meet either the asset test or the asset test  after the day cure period  we may dispose of sufficient assets generally within six months after the last day of the quarter in which our identification of the failure to satisfy these asset tests occurred to cure such a violation that does not exceed the lesser of of our assets at the end of the relevant quarter or  if we are entitled to avail ourselves of certain other relief provisions pertaining to the asset tests  we will maintain our qualification as a reit  but will be subject to certain penalty taxes as described above 
we may not  however  be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions in all circumstances 
if these relief provisions do not apply to a particular set of circumstances  we will not qualify as a reit 
we may at some point securitize mortgage loans and or mortgage backed securities 
if we were to securitize mortgage related assets ourselves on a regular basis other than through the issuance of non remic cmos  there is a substantial risk that the securities could be dealer property and that all of the profits from such sales would be subject to tax at the rate of as income from prohibited transactions 
accordingly  where we intend to sell the securities created by that process  we expect that we will engage in the securitization through one or more taxable reit subsidiaries  which will not be subject to this tax 
we also may securitize such mortgage related assets through the issuance of non remic cmos  whereby we retain an equity interest in the mortgage backed assets used as collateral in the securitization transaction 
the issuance of any such instruments could result in a portion of our assets being classified as a taxable mortgage pool  which would be treated as a separate corporation for us federal income tax purposes  which in turn could jeopardize our status as a reit 
we intend to structure our securitizations in a manner that would not result in the creation of a taxable mortgage pool 

table of contents annual distribution requirements to maintain our qualification as a reit  we are required to distribute dividends  other than capital gain dividends  to our stockholders in an amount at least equal to of our reit taxable net income  plus of our after tax net income  if any  from foreclosure property  minus the excess of the sum of specified items of our non cash income items over of reit taxable net income  as described below 
for purposes of these distribution requirements  our reit taxable net income is computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and net capital gain 
in addition  for purposes of this test  the specified items of non cash income include income attributable to leveled stepped rents  certain original issue discount  certain like kind exchanges that are later determined to be taxable and income from cancellation of indebtedness 
in addition  if we disposed of any asset we acquired from a corporation that is or has been a c corporation in a transaction in which our basis in the asset is determined by reference to the basis of the asset in the hands of that c corporation and we did not elect to recognize gain currently in connection with the acquisition of such asset  we would be required to distribute at least of the after tax gain  if any  we recognize on a disposition of the asset within the year period following our acquisition of such asset  to the extent that such gain does not exceed the excess of the fair market value of the asset on the date we acquired the asset  over our adjusted basis in the asset on the date we acquired the asset 
only distributions that qualify for the dividends paid deduction available to reits under the internal revenue code are counted in determining whether the distribution requirements are satisfied 
we must make these distributions in the taxable year to which they relate  or in the following taxable year if they are declared before we timely file our tax return for that year  paid on or before the first regular dividend payment following the declaration and we elect on our tax return to have a specified dollar amount of such distributions treated as if paid in the prior year 
for these and other purposes  dividends declared by us in october  november or december of one taxable year and payable to a stockholder of record on a specific date in any such month shall be treated as both paid by us and received by the stockholder during such taxable year  provided that the dividend is actually paid by us by january of the following taxable year 
in addition  dividends distributed by us must not be preferential 
if a dividend is preferential  it will not qualify for the dividends paid deduction 
to avoid being preferential  every stockholder of the class of stock to which a distribution is made must be treated the same as every other stockholder of that class  and no class of stock may be treated other than according to its dividend rights as a class 
to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain  or we distribute at least  but less than  of our reit taxable net income  as adjusted  we will be required to pay tax on this undistributed income at regular ordinary and capital gain corporate tax rates 
furthermore  if we fail to distribute during each calendar year or  in the case of distributions with declaration and record dates falling in the last three months of the calendar year  by the end of the january immediately following such year at least the sum of of our reit ordinary income for such year  of our reit capital gain income for such year  and any undistributed taxable income from prior periods  we will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the amounts actually distributed 
we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy the annual distribution requirements 
under certain circumstances  we may be able to rectify a failure to meet the distribution requirements for a year by paying deficiency dividends to our stockholders in a later year  which may be included in our deduction for dividends paid for the earlier year 
although we may be able to avoid being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends  we will be required to pay to the irs interest based upon the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency dividends 

table of contents failure to qualify as a reit if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year  and the relief provisions of the internal revenue code do not apply  we will be required to pay taxes  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on our taxable income in that taxable year and all subsequent taxable years at regular corporate rates 
distributions to our stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as a reit will not be deductible by us and we will not be required to distribute any amounts to our stockholders 
as a result  we anticipate that our failure to qualify as a reit would reduce the cash available for distribution to our stockholders 
in addition  if we fail to qualify as a reit  all distributions to our stockholders will be taxable at ordinary income rates to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits 
in this event  corporate distributees may be eligible for the dividends received deduction 
unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions  we will also be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we lose our qualification 
specified cure provisions will be available to us in the event we violate a provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit 
if we are entitled to avail ourselves of certain relief provisions  we will maintain our qualification as a reit but may be subject to certain penalty taxes as described above 
we may not  however  be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions in all circumstances 
if these relief provisions do not apply to a particular set of circumstances  we will not qualify as a reit 
taxation of taxable united states stockholders for purposes of the discussion in this form k  the term united states stockholder means a beneficial holder of our stock that is  for us federal income tax purposes a citizen or resident of the united states as determined for us federal income tax purposes  a corporation  partnership  or other entity created or organized in or under the laws of the united states or of any state thereof or in the district of columbia  unless treasury regulations provide otherwise  an estate the income of which is subject to us federal income taxation regardless of its source  or a trust whose administration is subject to the primary supervision of a us court and which has one or more us persons who have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust 
distributions generally distributions out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits  other than capital gain dividends  will be taxable to united states stockholders as ordinary income 
such reit dividends generally are ineligible for the new reduced tax rate with a maximum of for corporate dividends received by individuals  trusts and estates in years through however  such rate will apply to the extent that we make distributions attributable to amounts  if any  we receive as dividends from non reit corporations or to the extent that we make distributions attributable to the sum of i the excess of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains for the preceding year over the tax paid on such income  and ii the excess of our income subject to the built in gain tax over the tax payable by us on such income 
provided that we qualify as a reit  dividends paid by us will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction generally available to united states stockholders that are corporations 
to the extent that we make distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits  the distributions will be treated as a tax free return of capital to each united states stockholder  and will reduce the adjusted tax basis that each united states stockholder has in our stock by the amount of the distribution  but not below zero 
distributions in excess of a united states stockholder s adjusted tax basis in our stock will be taxable as capital gain  and will be taxable as long term capital gain if the stock has been held for more than one year 
the calculation of the amount of distributions that are applied against or exceed adjusted tax basis are made on a share by share basis 
to the extent that we make distributions  if any  that are attributable to excess inclusion income  such amounts may not be offset by net operating losses of a united states stockholder 
if we declare a dividend in october  november  or december of any calendar year that is payable to stockholders of record on a specified date in such a month and actually pay the dividend during january of the following calendar year  the dividend is deemed to be paid by us and 
table of contents received by the stockholder on december st of the year preceding the year of payment 
stockholders may not include in their own income tax returns any of our net operating losses or capital losses 
capital gain distributions distributions designated by us as capital gain dividends will be taxable to united states stockholders as capital gain income 
we can designate distributions as capital gain dividends to the extent of our net capital gain for the taxable year of the distribution 
for tax years prior to  this capital gain income will generally be taxable to non corporate united states stockholders at a or rate based on the characteristics of the asset we sold that produced the gain 
united states stockholders that are corporations may be required to treat up to of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income 
retention of net capital gains we may elect to retain  rather than distribute as a capital gain dividend  our net capital gains 
if we were to make this election  we would pay tax on such retained capital gains 
in such a case  our stockholders would generally include their proportionate share of our undistributed net capital gains in their taxable income  receive a credit for their proportionate share of the tax paid by us in respect of such net capital gain  and increase the adjusted basis of their stock by the difference between the amount of their share of our undistributed net capital gain and their share of the tax paid by us 
passive activity losses  investment interest limitations and other considerations of holding our stock distributions we make  undistributed net capital gain includible in income and gains arising from the sale or exchange of our stock by a united states stockholder will not be treated as passive activity income 
as a result  united states stockholders will not be able to apply any passive losses against income or gains relating to our stock 
distributions by us  to the extent they do not constitute a return of capital  and undistributed net capital gain includible in our stockholders income  generally will be treated as investment income for purposes of computing the investment interest limitation under the internal revenue code  provided the proper election is made 
if we  or a portion of our assets  were to be treated as a taxable mortgage pool  or if we were to acquire remic residual interests  our stockholders other than certain thrift institutions may not be permitted to offset certain portions of the dividend income they derive from our shares with their current deductions or net operating loss carryovers or carrybacks 
the portion of a stockholder s dividends that will be subject to this limitation will equal the allocable share of our excess inclusion income 
dispositions of stock a united states stockholder that sells or disposes of our stock will recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of cash or the fair market value of any property the stockholder receives on the sale or other disposition and the stockholder s adjusted tax basis in our stock 
this gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss and will be long term capital gain or loss if the stockholder has held the stock for more than one year 
however  any loss recognized by a united states stockholder upon the sale or other disposition of our stock that the stockholder has held for six months or less will be treated as long term capital loss to the extent the stockholder received distributions from us that were required to be treated as long term capital gains 
for tax years prior to  capital gain of an individual united states stockholder is generally taxed at a maximum rate of where the property is held for more than one year 
the deductibility of capital loss is limited 

table of contents information reporting and backup withholding we report to our united states stockholders and the irs the amount of dividends paid during each calendar year  along with the amount of any tax withheld 
under the backup withholding rules  a stockholder may be subject to backup withholding with respect to dividends paid and redemption proceeds unless the holder is a corporation or comes within other exempt categories and  when required  demonstrates this fact  or provides a taxpayer identification number or social security number  certifying as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding  and otherwise complies with applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules 
a united states stockholder that does not provide 
us with its correct taxpayer identification number or social security number may also be subject to penalties imposed by the irs 
a united states stockholder can meet this requirement by providing us with a correct  properly completed and executed copy of irs form w or a substantially similar form 
backup withholding is not an additional tax 
any amount paid as backup withholding will be creditable against the stockholder s income tax liability  if any  and otherwise be refundable  provided the proper forms are filed on a timely basis 
in addition  we may be required to withhold a portion of capital gain distributions made to any stockholders who fail to certify their non foreign status 
the backup withholding tax rate currently is 
taxation of tax exempt stockholders the irs has ruled that amounts distributed as a dividend by a reit will be treated as a dividend by the recipient and excluded from the calculation of unrelated business taxable income when received by a tax exempt entity 
based on that ruling  provided that a tax exempt stockholder has not held our stock as debt financed property within the meaning of the internal revenue code  ie  property the acquisition or holding of which is or is treated as financed through a borrowing by the tax exempt united states stockholder  the stock is not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business  and we do not hold an asset that gives rise to excess inclusion income  as defined in section e of the internal revenue code  dividend income on our stock and income from the sale of our stock should not be unrelated business taxable income to a tax exempt stockholder 
however  if we were to hold residual interests in a remic  or if we or a pool of our assets were to be treated as a taxable mortgage pool  a portion of the dividends paid to a tax exempt stockholder may be subject to tax as unrelated business taxable income 
although we do not believe that we  or any portion of our assets  will be treated as a taxable mortgage pool  we cannot assure you that that the irs might not successfully maintain that such a taxable mortgage pool exists 
for tax exempt stockholders that are social clubs  voluntary employees beneficiary associations  supplemental unemployment benefit trusts  and qualified group legal services plans exempt from us federal income taxation under sections c  c  c and c of the internal revenue code  respectively  income from an investment in our stock will constitute unrelated business taxable income unless the organization is able to properly claim a deduction for amounts set aside or placed in reserve for certain purposes so as to offset the income generated by its investment in our stock 
any prospective investors should consult their tax advisors concerning these set aside and reserve requirements 
notwithstanding the above  however  a substantial portion of the dividends received with respect to our stock may constitute unrelated business taxable income  or ubti  if we are treated as a pension held reit and you are a pension trust that is described in section a of the internal revenue code  and holds more than  by value  of our equity interests 
tax exempt pension funds that are described in section a of the internal revenue code and exempt from tax under section a of the internal revenue code are referred to below as qualified trusts 

table of contents a reit is a pension held reit if it would not have qualified as a reit but for the fact that section h of the internal revenue code provides that stock owned by a qualified trust shall be treated  for purposes of the rule  described above  as owned by the beneficiaries of the trust  rather than by the trust itself  and either at least one qualified trust holds more than  by value  of the interests in the reit  or one or more qualified trusts  each of which owns more than  by value  of the interests in the reit  holds in the aggregate more than  by value  of the interests in the reit 
the percentage of any reit dividends treated as ubti under these rules is equal to the ratio of the ubti earned by the reit  less directly related expenses  treating the reit as if it were a qualified trust and therefore subject to tax on ubti  to the total gross income  less directly related expenses  of the reit 
a de minimis exception applies where this percentage is less than for any year 
as a result of the limitations on the transfer and ownership of stock contained in our charter  we do not expect to be classified as a pension held reit 
taxation of non united states stockholders the rules governing us federal income taxation of non united states stockholders are complex and no attempt will be made herein to provide more than a summary of these rules 
beneficial owners of shares of our stock that are not united states stockholders as such term is defined in the discussion above under the heading entitled taxation of taxable united states stockholders are referred to herein as non united states stockholders 
prospective non us stockholders should consult their tax advisors to determine the impact of foreign  federal  state  and local income tax laws with regard to an investment in our stock and of our election to be taxed as a real estate investment trust  including any reporting requirements 
distributions of operating income 
distributions to non united states stockholders that are not attributable to gain from our sale or exchange of us real property interests and that are not designated by us as capital gain dividends or retained capital gains  which we refer to as ordinary income distributions will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits 
these distributions will generally be subject to a withholding tax equal to of the distribution unless an applicable tax treaty reduces or eliminates that tax 
however  if income from an investment in our stock is treated as effectively connected with the non united states stockholder s conduct of a us trade or business or  if an income tax treaty applies  is attributable to a us permanent establishment of the non united states stockholder  the non united states stockholder generally will be subject to federal income tax at graduated rates in the same manner as united states stockholders are taxed with respect to those distributions  and also may be subject to the branch profits tax in the case of a non united states stockholder that is a corporation  unless a treaty reduces or eliminates these taxes 
we expect to withhold tax at the rate of on the gross amount of any ordinary income distributions made to a non united states stockholder unless a lower treaty rate applies and any required form  for example irs form w ben  evidencing eligibility for that reduced rate is filed by the non united states stockholder with us  or the non united states stockholder files an irs form w eci with us claiming that the distribution is effectively connected income 
any portion of the dividends paid to non united states stockholders that is treated as excess inclusion income  as defined in section e of the internal revenue code  will not be eligible for exemption from the withholding tax or a reduced treaty rate 

table of contents distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits that are not treated as attributable to the gain from our disposition of a us real property interest will not be taxable to non united states stockholders to the extent that these distributions do not exceed the adjusted basis of the stockholder s stock  but rather will reduce the adjusted basis of that stock 
to the extent that distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits exceed the adjusted basis of a non united states stockholder s stock  these distributions will give rise to tax liability if the non united states stockholder would otherwise be subject to tax on any gain from the sale or disposition of its stock  as described below 
because it generally cannot be determined at the time a distribution is made whether or not such distribution may be in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits  the entire amount of any ordinary income distribution normally will be subject to withholding at the same rate as a dividend 
however  amounts so withheld are creditable against us tax liability  if any  or refundable by the irs to the extent the distribution is subsequently determined to be in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and the proper forms are filed with the irs by the stockholder on a timely basis 
we are also required to withhold of any distribution in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits if our stock is a us real property interest because we are not a domestically controlled reit  as discussed below 
consequently  although we intend to withhold at a rate of on the entire amount of an ordinary income distribution  to the extent that we do not do so  any portion of an ordinary income distribution not subject to withholding at a rate of may be subject to withholding at a rate of 
capital gains distributions 
distributions attributable to our capital gains that are not attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a us real property interest generally will not be subject to income taxation  unless investment in our stock is effectively connected with the non united states stockholder s us trade or business or  if an income tax treaty applies  is attributable to a us permanent establishment of the non united states stockholder  in which case the non united states stockholder will be subject to the same treatment as united states stockholders with respect to such gain and a corporate non united states stockholder may also be subject to the branch profits tax  or the non united states stockholder is a non resident alien individual who is present in the us for days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions are satisfied  in which case the non resident alien individual will be subject to a tax on the individual s net capital gains 
for any year in which we qualify as a reit  distributions that are attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a us real property interest  which includes some interests in real property  but generally does not include an interest solely as a creditor in mortgage loans or mortgage backed securities  will be taxed to a non united states stockholder under the provisions of the foreign investment in real property tax act  or firpta 
under firpta  distributions attributable to gain from sales of us real property interests are taxed to a non united states stockholder as if that gain were effectively connected with the stockholder s conduct of a us trade or business 
non united states stockholders thus would be taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to united states stockholders  subject to applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals 
distributions subject to firpta also may be subject to the branch profits tax in the hands of a non us corporate stockholder 
we are required to withhold of any distribution paid to a non united states stockholder that we designate or  if greater  the amount that we could designate as a capital gains dividend 
the amount withheld is creditable against the non united states stockholder s firpta tax liability  provided the proper forms are filed by the stockholders on a timely basis 
pursuant to the jobs act  any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of stock that is regularly traded on an established securities market located in the united states is not subject to firpta  and therefore  not subject to the us withholding tax  if the non united states stockholder did not own more than of such class of stock at any time during the taxable year 
instead  any such capital gain dividend will be treated as an ordinary dividend distribution generally subject to withholding at a rate of unless otherwise reduced or eliminated by an applicable income tax treaty 
gains on the sale of our stock 
gains recognized by a non united states stockholder upon a sale of our stock generally will not be taxed under firpta if we are a domestically controlled reit  which is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than in value of the stock was held 
table of contents directly or indirectly by non united states stockholders 
because our stock is publicly traded widely held  we cannot assure our investors that we are or will remain a domestically controlled reit 
even if we are not a domestically controlled reit  however  a non united states stockholder that owns  actually or constructively  or less of our stock throughout a specified testing period will not recognize taxable gain on the sale of our stock under firpta as long as our shares are traded on the new york stock exchange 
if gain from the sale of our stock were subject to taxation under firpta  the non united states stockholder would be subject to the same treatment as united states stockholders with respect to that gain  subject to applicable alternative minimum tax  a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals  and the possible application of the branch profits tax in the case of non us corporations 
in addition  the purchaser of the stock could be required to withhold of the purchase price and remit such amount to the irs on behalf of the non united states stockholder 
gains not subject to firpta will be taxable to a non united states stockholder if the non united states stockholder s investment in our stock is effectively connected with a trade or business in the us or  if an income tax treaty applies  is attributable to a us permanent establishment of the non united states stockholder  in which case the non united states stockholder will be subject to the same treatment as united states stockholders with respect to that gain  or the non united states stockholder is a nonresident alien individual who was present in the us for days or more during the taxable year and other conditions are met  in which case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a tax on the individual s capital gains 
information reporting and backup withholding for non united states stockholders if the proceeds of a disposition of our stock are paid by or through a us office of a broker dealer  the payment is generally subject to information reporting and to backup withholding currently at a rate of unless the disposing non united states stockholder certifies as to his name  address and non us status or otherwise establishes an exemption 
generally  us information reporting and backup withholding will not apply to a payment of disposition proceeds if the payment is made outside the us through a foreign office of a foreign broker dealer 
if the proceeds from a disposition of our stock are paid to or through a foreign office of a us broker dealer or a us office of a foreign broker dealer that is a controlled foreign corporation for us federal income tax purposes  a foreign person or more of whose gross income from all sources for a three year period was effectively connected with a us trade or business  a foreign partnership with one or more partners who are us persons and who in the aggregate hold more than of the income or capital interest in the partnership  or a foreign partnership engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the us  then a backup withholding will not apply unless the broker dealer has actual knowledge that the owner is not a foreign stockholder  and b information reporting will not apply if the non united states stockholder satisfies certification requirements regarding its status as a foreign stockholder 
other information reporting rules apply to non united states stockholders  and prospective non united states stockholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding these requirements 
possible legislative or other action affecting tax consequences you should recognize that the present us federal income tax treatment of an investment in us may be modified by legislative  judicial or administrative action at any time and that any such action may affect investments and commitments previously made 
the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the internal revenue service and the treasury department  resulting in revisions of regulations and revised interpretations of established concepts as well as statutory changes 
revisions in federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could affect the tax consequences of an investment in us

we expect that future distributions will be based on our reit taxable net income in future periods  which we cannot predict with any certainty 
all distribution declarations are made at the discretion of our board of directors 
the distributions are taxable dividends and are not considered a return of capital 
distributions are funded with cash flows from our ongoing operations  including principal and interest payments received on our mortgage backed securities 
we intend to distribute all or substantially all of our reit taxable net income which does not ordinarily equate to net income as calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which are known as gaap to our stockholders in each year 
we intend to make regular quarterly distributions to our stockholders to be paid out of funds readily available for such distributions 
our distribution policy is subject to revision at the discretion of our board of directors without stockholder approval or notice to you 
we have not established a minimum distribution level and our ability to make distributions may be harmed for the reasons described under the caption risk factors 
all distributions will depend on our earnings and financial condition  maintenance of reit status  applicable provisions of the maryland general corporation law  or mgcl  and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant 
in order to avoid corporate income and excise tax and to maintain our qualification as a reit under the internal revenue code  we must make distributions to our stockholders each year in an amount at least equal to of our reit taxable net income  plus of our after tax net income  if any  from foreclosure property  minus the excess of the sum of specified items of our non cash income items over of reit taxable net income 
in general  our distributions will be applied toward these requirements only if paid in the taxable year to which they relate  or in the following taxable year if the distributions are declared before we timely file our tax return for that year  the distributions are paid on or before the first regular distribution payment following the declaration and we elect on our tax return to have a specified dollar amount of such distributions treated as if paid in the prior year 
distributions declared by us in october  november or december of one taxable year and payable to a stockholder of record on a specific date in such a month are treated as both paid by us and received by the stockholder during such taxable year  provided that the distribution is actually paid by us by january of the following taxable year 

table of contents we anticipate that distributions generally will be taxable as ordinary income to our stockholders  although a portion of such distributions may be designated by us as capital gain or may constitute a return of capital 
we will furnish annually to each of our stockholders a statement setting forth distributions paid during the preceding year and their characterization as ordinary income  return of capital or capital gains 
in the future  our board of directors may elect to adopt a dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 
equity compensation plan effective june   we adopted a stock incentive plan and a outside advisors stock incentive plan pursuant to which up to  shares of our common stock is authorized to be awarded at the discretion of the compensation committee of the board of directors 
the plans provide for the grant of a variety of long term incentive awards to employees and officers  individual consultants or advisors who render or have rendered bona fide services  and officers  employees or directors of seneca as an additional means to attract  motivate  retain and reward eligible persons 
these plans provide for the grant of awards that meet the requirements of section of the internal revenue code  non qualified stock options  stock appreciation rights  restricted stock  stock units and other stock based awards and dividend equivalent rights

overview luminent mortgage capital  inc is a reit headquartered in san francisco  california 
we were incorporated in april to invest primarily in us agency and other highly rated  single family  adjustable rate  hybrid adjustable rate and fixed rate mortgage backed securities  which we acquire in the secondary market 
substantive operations began mid june  after completing a private placement of our common stock 
our strategy is to acquire mortgage related assets  finance these purchases in the capital markets and use leverage in order to provide an attractive return on stockholders equity 
through this strategy  we seek to earn income  which is generated from the spread between the yield on our earning assets and our costs  including the interest cost of the funds we borrow 
we have acquired and will seek to acquire additional assets that will produce competitive returns  taking into consideration the amount and nature of the anticipated returns from the investment  our ability to pledge the investment for secured  collateralized borrowings and the costs associated with financing  managing  securitizing and reserving for these investments 
our business is affected by a variety of economic and industry factors 
the most significant risk factors management considers while managing the business that could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations are interest rate mismatches between our adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities and our borrowings used to fund our purchases of mortgage backed securities  increasing or decreasing levels of prepayments on the mortgages underlying our mortgage backed securities  the potential for increased borrowing costs related to repurchase agreements  interest rate caps related to our adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities  the overall leverage of our portfolio  our ability or inability to use derivatives to mitigate our interest rate and prepayment risks  the impact that increases in interest rates would have on our book value  maintaining adequate borrowing capacity so that we can purchase mortgage related assets and reach our desired amount of leverage  if we fail to obtain or renew sufficient funding on favorable terms or at all  we will be limited in our ability to acquire mortgage related assets  possible market developments could cause our lenders to require us to pledge additional assets as collateral  if our assets are insufficient to meet the collateral requirements  we might be compelled to liquidate particular assets at inopportune times and at disadvantageous prices  competition might prevent us from acquiring mortgage backed securities at favorable yields  which would harm our results of operations  
table of contents if we are disqualified as a reit  we will be subject to tax as a regular corporation and face substantial tax liability  and complying with reit requirements might cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 
management has established interest rate risk and other policies for managing the portfolio of mortgage backed securities and the related borrowings outstanding 
these policies include  but are not limited to  evaluating the level of risk we assume when purchasing adjustable rate or hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities that are subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps  matching the interest rates on our assets and liabilities  acquiring new mortgage backed securities to replace prepaid securities  purchasing mortgage backed securities that we believe to have favorable risk adjusted expected returns relative to the market interest rates at the time of purchase  borrowing between eight and times the amount of our stockholders equity  entering into derivative transactions to protect us from rising interest rates on our repurchase agreements and monitoring our qualification as a reit 
refer to the section titled risk factors for additional discussion regarding these and other risk factors that affect our business 
refer to the section interest rate risk of item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk  for additional interest rate risk discussion 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make some complex and subjective decisions and assessments 
our most critical accounting policies involve decisions and assessments that could significantly affect our reported assets and liabilities  as well as our reported revenues and expenses 
we believe that all of the decisions and assessments upon which our financial statements are based were reasonable at the time made based upon information available to us at that time 
see note to our financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies 
management has identified our most critical accounting policies to be the following classifications of investment securities our investments in mortgage backed securities are classified as available for sale securities that are carried on our balance sheet at their fair value 
the classification of the securities as available for sale results in changes in fair value being recorded as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income or loss  which is a component of stockholders equity  rather than immediately through earnings 
if available for sale securities were classified as trading securities  our earnings could experience substantially greater volatility from period to period 
valuations of mortgage backed securities our mortgage backed securities have fair values as determined by management with reference to price estimates provided by independent pricing services and dealers in the securities 
because the price estimates may vary to some degree between sources  management must make certain judgments and assumptions about the appropriate price to use to calculate the fair values for financial reporting purposes 
different judgments and assumptions could result in different presentations of value 
when the fair value of an available for sale security is less than amortized cost  management considers whether there is an other than temporary impairment in the value of the security 
if  in management s judgment  an other than temporary impairment exists  the cost basis of the security is written down to the then current fair value  and the unrealized loss is transferred from accumulated other comprehensive income or loss as an immediate reduction of current earnings as if the loss had been realized in the period of impairment 
the determination of other than temporary impairment is a subjective process  and different judgments and assumptions could affect the timing of loss realization 

table of contents management considers the following factors when evaluating the securities for an other than temporary impairment the length of the time and the extent to which the market value has been less than the amortized cost  whether the security has been downgraded by a rating agency  and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
the determination of other than temporary impairment is evaluated at least quarterly 
if in the future management determines an impairment to be other than temporary we may need to realize a loss that would have an impact on future income 
interest income recognition interest income on our mortgage backed securities is accrued based on the actual coupon rate and the outstanding principal amount of the underlying mortgages 
premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted into interest income over the lives of the securities using the effective yield method adjusted for the effects of estimated prepayments based on statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases 
if our estimate of prepayments is incorrect  we may be required to make an adjustment to the amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts that would have an impact on future income 
accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities our policies permit us to enter into derivative contracts  including eurodollar futures contracts and interest rate swaps  as a means of mitigating our interest rate risk on forecasted interest expense associated with the benchmark rate on forecasted rollover reissuance of repurchase agreements or the interest rate repricing of repurchase agreements  or hedged items  for a specified future time period 
at december   we have engaged in short sales of eurodollar futures contracts to mitigate our interest rate risk for the specified future time period  which is defined as the calendar quarter immediately following the contract expiration date 
the value of these futures contracts is marked to market daily in our margin account with the custodian 
based upon the daily market value of these futures contracts  we either receive funds into  or wire funds into  our margin account with the custodian to ensure that an appropriate margin account balance is maintained at all times through the expiration of the contracts 
at december   we have entered into interest rate swap contracts to mitigate our interest rate risk for the period defined by the maturity of the swap 
cash flows that occur each time the swap is repriced are associated with forecasted interest expense for a specified future period  which is defined as the calendar period preceding each repricing date with the same number of months as the repricing frequency 
the futures and interest rate swap contracts  or hedge instruments  have been designated as cash flow hedges and are evaluated at inception and on an ongoing basis in order to determine whether they qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted 
the hedge instrument must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged in order to qualify for hedge accounting 
in order to determine whether the hedge instrument is highly effective  we use regression methodology to assess the effectiveness of our hedging strategies 
specifically  at the inception of each new hedge and on an ongoing basis  we assess effectiveness using ordinary least squares regression to evaluate the correlation between the rates consistent with the hedge instrument and the underlying hedged items 
a hedge instrument is highly effective if the changes in the fair value of the derivative provide offset of at least and not more than of the changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged 
the futures and interest rate swap contracts are carried on the balance sheet at fair value 
any ineffectiveness that arises during the hedging relationship is recognized in interest expense during the period in which it arises 
prior to the end of the specified hedge time period  the effective portion of all contract gains and losses whether 
table of contents realized or unrealized is recorded in other comprehensive income or loss 
realized gains and losses on futures contracts are reclassified into earnings as an adjustment to interest expense during the specified hedge time period 
realized gains and losses on interest rate swap contracts are reclassified into earnings as an adjustment to interest expense during the period subsequent to the swap repricing date through the remaining maturity of the swap 
for reit taxable net income purposes  realized gains and losses on futures and interest rate swap contracts are reclassified into earnings immediately when positions are closed or have expired 
we are not required to account for the futures and interest rate swap contracts using hedge accounting as described above 
if we decided not to designate the futures and interest rate swap contracts as hedges and to monitor their effectiveness as hedges  or if we entered into other types of financial instruments that did not meet the criteria to be designated as hedges  changes in the fair values of these instruments would be recorded in the statement of operations  potentially resulting in increased volatility in our earnings 
management incentive compensation expense the management agreement provides for the payment of incentive compensation to seneca if our financial performance exceeds certain benchmarks 
incentive compensation is calculated on a cumulative  quarterly basis for gaap purposes and on a stand alone quarterly basis with an annual cumulative reconciliation calculation for incentive compensation payment purposes 
during each quarter of the fiscal year  we calculate the incentive compensation expense quarterly  on a cumulative basis  making any necessary adjustments for any expensed amounts that were recognized in previous quarters 
as a result  if we experience poor quarterly performance in a particular quarter and this performance causes the cumulative incentive compensation expense for the current quarter to be lower than the cumulative incentive compensation for the prior quarter  we will record a negative incentive compensation expense in the current quarter 
the incentive compensation is payable one half in cash and one half in the form of our restricted common stock 
for the first  second and third quarters of each fiscal year  incentive compensation payments actually paid to seneca are calculated based upon the net income and relevant performance thresholds solely for the applicable quarter  and a cumulative calculation is performed at the end of the fiscal year 
as a result  during the first three quarters of each fiscal year there may be differences between incentive compensation expense  for gaap purposes  and the incentive compensation amounts actually paid to seneca 
any differences between these amounts will be reflected on the balance sheet as a receivable due from or payable due to seneca 
in addition  when each annual cumulative incentive compensation calculation and reconciliation is performed  seneca may be required to return cash incentive compensation payments earlier received or shares of common stock earlier granted  as applicable  to it as part of its incentive compensation payments for the first three quarters of the fiscal year 
the cash portion of the incentive compensation is accrued and expensed during the period for which it is calculated and paid 
we account for the restricted common stock portion of the incentive compensation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and related interpretations  and eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
this restricted common stock portion of the incentive compensation is granted to seneca on a quarterly basis pursuant to the terms of the management agreement 
the number of shares issued is based on a one half of the total incentive compensation for the period  divided by b the average of the closing prices of our common stock over the day period ending three calendar days prior to the grant date  less a fair market value discount determined quarterly by our board of directors to account for the transfer restrictions during the vesting period 
during periods of lower stock prices  we will issue more restricted common stock to seneca under the management agreement to pay for the same amount of incentive compensation earned in periods that had higher stock prices 
over the vesting period  any additional shares issued would have a dilutive effect on book value and net income per share 
on the date of each restricted common stock grant to seneca under the management agreement  the fair market value of the restricted common stock is recorded in the stockholders equity section of our balance sheet as common stock and additional paid in capital 
the corresponding portion of any restricted common 
table of contents stock grant that is not expensed is reflected in the stockholders equity section of our balance sheet as deferred compensation 
each quarter s incentive compensation restricted common stock grant to seneca is divided into three tranches 
the first tranche vests over a one year period and is expensed over a five quarter period  beginning in the quarter in which it was earned 
the second tranche vests over a two year period and is expensed over a nine quarter period beginning in the quarter in which it was earned 
the third tranche vests over a three year period and is expensed over a thirteen quarter period beginning in the quarter in which it was earned 
as a result of this vesting schedule for the restricted common stock granted to seneca  we will incur incentive compensation expense in each of the periods following the grant of the restricted common stock over a three year period 
we will continue to incur incentive compensation expense related to each restricted common stock grant  even in subsequent periods in which seneca did not earn incentive compensation under the management agreement 
as the price of our common stock changes in future periods  the fair value of the unvested portions of shares paid to seneca pursuant to the management agreement will be marked to market  with corresponding entries on the balance sheet 
the net effect of any mark to market adjustments to the value of the unvested portions of the restricted common stock will be expensed in future periods  on a ratable basis  according to the remaining vesting schedules of each respective tranche of restricted common stock 
accordingly  incentive compensation expense related to the portion of the incentive compensation paid to seneca in each restricted common stock grant may be higher or lower from one reporting period to the next  and may vary throughout the vesting period 
for example  future incentive compensation expense related to previously issued but unvested restricted common stock will be higher during periods of increasing stock prices  and lower during periods of decreasing stock prices 
in addition  over the vesting period for each restricted common stock grant  our stockholders equity will increase or decrease based upon the current market price of our stock 
as a result  this expense adjustment will have the effect of increasing or decreasing our net worth  the factor used in calculating seneca s base management fee  and may increase or decrease the amount of base management fees in future periods 
pursuant to the management agreement  it is possible for seneca to earn incentive compensation each quarter and  as a result  receive a restricted common stock grant each quarter 
as seneca is granted multiple tranches of restricted common stock for incentive compensation  we will experience increasing management fee expense due to the cumulative impact of multiple tranches and vesting schedules of restricted common stock grants  and the mark to market impact of the unvested portions of these grants 
this increase in management fee expense will be true even in periods where there is little change in our income or stock price 
we also pay incentive compensation  in the form of cash and restricted common stock  to our chief financial officer  in accordance with the terms of his employment agreement 
the incentive compensation is accounted for in the same manner as the incentive compensation earned by seneca 
financial condition all of our assets at december  were acquired with the proceeds of our june private placement of  shares of our common stock  our december initial public offering of  shares of our common stock  our march follow on public offering of  shares of our common stock and use of leverage 
we received net proceeds after offering costs of million from the private placement offering  which was completed in mid june  million from the initial public offering  which was completed on december  and million from the follow on public offering  which was completed on march  mortgage backed securities at december   we held billion of mortgage backed securities at fair value  net of unrealized gains of thousand and unrealized losses of million 
at december   we held billion of mortgage backed securities at fair value  net of unrealized gains of million and unrealized losses of million 
the increase in mortgage backed securities held is primarily the result of the public offering that was completed on march   as well as security purchases in the first quarter of made as a 
table of contents result of fully leveraging the proceeds from our initial public offering 
as of december  and  substantially all of the mortgage backed securities in our portfolio were purchased at a premium to their par value and our portfolio had a weighted average amortized cost of and of the face amount  respectively 
fair value was below amortized cost for certain of the securities held at december  and at december  and  our entire portfolio was invested in aaa rated non agency backed or agency backed mortgage backed securities 
none of the securities held had been downgraded by a credit rating agency since their purchase 
in addition  we intend and have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for the anticipated recovery in fair value of the securities held 
as such  we do not believe any of the securities held were other than temporarily impaired at december  and the stated contractual final maturity of the mortgage loans underlying our portfolio of mortgage backed securities ranges up to years  however  the expected maturity is subject to change based on the prepayments of the underlying mortgage loans 
the following table sets forth the maturity dates  by year  and percentage composition related to the assets that comprise our investment portfolio at december  average final asset maturity of total adjustable rate mortgage backed securities hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities balloon mortgage backed securities fixed rate mortgage backed securities n a n a the following table sets forth the maturity dates  by year  and percentage composition related to the assets that comprise our investment portfolio at december  average final asset maturity of total adjustable rate mortgage backed securities hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities balloon mortgage backed securities fixed rate mortgage backed securities n a n a actual maturities of mortgage backed securities are generally shorter than stated contractual maturities 
actual maturities of our mortgage backed securities are affected by the contractual lives of the underlying mortgages  periodic payments of principal and prepayments of principal 
the principal payment rate on our mortgage backed securities  an annual rate of principal paydowns for our mortgage backed securities relative to the outstanding principal balance of our mortgage backed securities  was for the three months ended december  the principal payment rate for the three months ended december  was 
the principal payment rate attempts to predict the percentage of principal that will paydown over the next months based on historical principal paydowns 
the principal payment rate within our portfolio for the second half of was relatively constant 
this rate cannot be considered an indication of future principal prepayment rates because actual changes in interest rates in will have a direct impact on the principal prepayments within our portfolio 
at december  and  the weighted average effective duration of the securities in our overall investment portfolio  assuming constant prepayment rates  or cpr  to the balloon or reset date  or the cpb duration  was years and years  respectively 
cpr is a measure of the rate of prepayment for our mortgage backed securities  expressed as an annual rate relative to the outstanding principal balance of our mortgage backed securities 
cpb duration is similar to cpr except that it also assumes that the hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities prepay in full at their next reset date 
at december  and  the mortgages underlying our hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities had fixed interest rates for a weighted average of approximately months and months  respectively  after which time the interest rates reset and become adjustable 
the average length of time until maturity of those mortgages was years 

table of contents those mortgages are also subject to interest rate caps that limit the amount that the applicable interest rate can increase during any year  known as an annual cap  and through the maturity of the applicable security  known as a lifetime cap 
at december  and  the mortgages underlying our hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities with specific annual caps had average annual caps of and  respectively  and average lifetime caps of and  respectively 
the following table summarizes our mortgage backed securities at december  according to their estimated weighted average life classifications weighted average weighted average life fair value amortized cost coupon in thousands less than one year greater than one year and less than five years greater than five years total the following table summarizes our mortgage backed securities at december  according to their estimated weighted average life classifications weighted average weighted average life fair value amortized cost coupon in thousands less than one year greater than one year and less than five years greater than five years total the weighted average lives of the mortgage backed securities at december  and in the tables above are based upon data provided through a subscription based financial information service provided by a major investment bank  assuming constant prepayment rates to the balloon or reset date for each security 
at december  and  the weighted average lives were calculated using estimated prepayment speeds or actual prepayment speed history 
the weighted average lives for some of the mortgage backed securities included in the table above were estimated using expected prepayment speeds for pools with similar characteristics  since certain pools were new issues and did not have historical performance data available 
the prepayment model considers current yield  forward yield  steepness of the yield curve  current mortgage rates  mortgage rate of the outstanding loan  loan age  margin and volatility 
the actual weighted average lives of the mortgage backed securities in our investment portfolio could be longer or shorter than the estimates in the tables above depending on the actual prepayment rates experienced over the life of the applicable securities and is sensitive to changes in both prepayment rates and interest rates 
equity securities our investment policies allow us to acquire a limited amount of equity securities  including common and preferred shares issued by other real estate investment trusts 
at december  and  we did not hold any equity securities 
unsettled securities purchases at december   we had no unsettled security trades 
at december   we had unsettled securities purchases of million  which subsequently settled in january of the million of unsettled securities purchases  million were related to to be announced  or tba  mortgage backed securities 

table of contents other assets we had other assets of million and million at december  and  respectively 
other assets at december  consist primarily of interest receivable of million  principal receivable of million  prepaid directors and officers liability insurance of thousand  deferred financing costs of thousand and deferred compensation of thousand 
other assets at december  consist primarily of interest receivable of million  principal receivable of million  prepaid directors and officers liability insurance of thousand and deferred compensation of thousand 
the increases in interest receivable and principal receivable at december  compared to december  are primarily due to the increase in our portfolio of mortgage backed securities during the year 
hedging instruments hedging involves risk and typically involves costs  including transaction costs 
the costs of hedging can increase as the period covered by the hedging increases and during periods of rising and volatile interest rates 
we may increase our hedging activity and  thus  increase our hedging costs during such periods when interest rates are volatile or rising 
we generally intend to hedge as much of the interest rate risk as seneca determines is in the best interest of our stockholders  after considering the cost of such hedging transactions and our desire to maintain our status as a reit 
our policies do not contain specific requirements as to the percentages or amount of interest rate risk that seneca is required to hedge 
there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
moreover  no hedging activity can completely insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates and prepayment rates 
at december   we have engaged in short sales of eurodollar futures contracts as a means of mitigating our interest rate risk on forecasted interest expense associated with the benchmark rate on forecasted rollover reissuance of repurchase agreements or the interest rate repricing of repurchase agreements  or hedged item  for a specified future time period  which is defined as the calendar quarter immediately following the contract expiration date 
at december   we had short positions on  eurodollar futures contracts  which expire in march  june  december and march with a notional amount totaling billion 
the value of these futures contracts is marked to market daily in our margin account with the custodian 
based upon the daily market value of these futures contracts  we either receive funds into  or wire funds into  our margin account with the custodian to ensure that an appropriate margin account balance is maintained at all times through the expiration of the contracts 
at december   we had short positions on  eurodollar futures contracts  which expired in march  june  and september  with a notional amount totaling billion 
at december  and december   the fair value of the eurodollar futures contracts was million and thousand recorded in liabilities  respectively 
at december   we have entered into interest rate swap contracts to mitigate our interest rate risk for the period defined by maturity of the interest rate swap 
cash flows that occur each time the swap is repriced are associated with forecasted interest expense for a specified future period  which is defined as the calendar period preceding each repricing date with the same number of months as the repricing frequency 
at december   the current notional amount of interest rate swap contracts totaled billion and the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts was million recorded in assets 
we had not entered into interest rate swap contracts at december  counterparties to our interest rate swap contracts are well known financial institutions and default risk is considered low 
liabilities we have entered into repurchase agreements to finance some of our acquisitions of mortgage backed securities 
none of the counterparties to these agreements are affiliates of seneca or us 
these agreements are secured by our mortgage backed securities and bear interest at rates that have historically moved in close relationship to libor 
as of december  and  we had established borrowing arrangements 
table of contents with various investment banking firms and other lenders  of which were in use on december  and at december   we had outstanding billion of repurchase agreements with a weighted average current borrowing rate of  million of which matures within days  billion of which matures between and days and billion of which matures in greater than days 
at december   we had outstanding billion of repurchase agreements with a weighted average current borrowing rate of  million of which matures within days  million of which matures between and days and billion of which matures in greater than days 
the increase in outstanding repurchase agreements is primarily due to the public offering that was completed on march   as well as from fully leveraging the proceeds from our initial public offering 
we used the net proceeds of the initial public offering and follow on equity offering to purchase mortgage backed securities through leverage 
it is our present intention to seek to renew the repurchase agreements outstanding at december  as they mature under the then applicable borrowing terms of the counterparties to our repurchase agreements 
at december  and  the repurchase agreements were secured by mortgage backed securities with an estimated fair value of billion and billion  respectively  and had a weighted average maturity of days and days  respectively 
the net amount at risk  defined as the sum of the fair value of securities sold plus accrued interest income minus the sum of repurchase agreement liabilities plus accrued interest expense  with all counterparties was million and million at december  and  respectively 
after consideration of the terms of our eurodollar futures and interest rate swap contracts  the weighted average days to rate reset of our total liabilities was days and days at december  and  respectively 
the increase in the weighted average days to rate reset of our total liabilities is primarily attributed to the use of interest rate swap contracts to hedge the impact of changes in interest rates on our liability costs 
we had million and million of other liabilities at december  and  respectively 
other liabilities at december  consisted primarily of million of cash distribution payable  million of accrued interest expense on repurchase agreements and interest rate swap contracts and million of management fees payable  incentive compensation payable and other related party liabilities 
other liabilities at december  consisted primarily of million of unsettled securities purchases  million of cash distribution payable  million of accrued interest expense on repurchase agreements  million of accounts payable and accrued expenses and million of management fee payable  incentive compensation payable and other related party liabilities 
we have a margin lending facility with our primary custodian from which we may borrow money in connection with the purchase or sale of securities 
the terms of the borrowings  including the rate of interest payable  are agreed to with the custodian for each amount borrowed 
borrowings are repayable immediately upon demand by the custodian 
there were no outstanding borrowings under the margin lending facility at december  and  respectively 
stockholders equity stockholders equity at december  and was million and million  respectively  which included million and million  respectively  of net unrealized losses on mortgage backed securities available for sale and million and thousand  respectively  of net deferred realized and unrealized gains losses on cash flow hedges presented as accumulated other comprehensive loss 
weighted average stockholders equity and return on average equity for year ended december  were million and  respectively 
return on average equity is defined as annualized net income divided by weighted average stockholders equity 
weighted average stockholders equity for the period from june   commencement of operations  through december  was million 
weighted average stockholders equity and return on average equity for the period from april  through december  is considered not meaningful as the company was organized on april  and substantive operations did not begin until mid june 
table of contents return on average equity was for the period from june   commencement of operations  through december  our book value at december  was as follows total stockholders book value equity per share dollars in thousands  except per share amounts total stockholders equity gaap addback subtract accumulated other comprehensive loss on mortgage backed securities accumulated other comprehensive income on interest rate swap contracts total stockholders equity  excluding accumulated other comprehensive income and loss on mortgage backed securities and interest rate swap contracts non gaap based on  shares outstanding at december  our book value at december  was as follows total stockholders book value equity per share dollars in thousands  except per share amounts total stockholders equity gaap addback accumulated other comprehensive loss on mortgage backed securities total stockholders equity  excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss on mortgage backed securities non gaap based on  shares outstanding on december  management believes that total stockholders equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income and loss on mortgage backed securities and interest rate swap contracts  is a useful measure to investors because book value unadjusted for temporary changes in fair value more closely represents the cost basis of our invested assets  net of our leverage  which is the basis for our net interest income and our distributions to stockholders under the tax provisions of the internal revenue code governing reit distributions 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the period from april  through december  the results of operations for the current year are not comparable to those in primarily due to the substantial asset base growth resulting from our initial public offering and follow on public offering and full year of operations in for the year ended december   net income was million  or per weighted average share outstanding basic and diluted 
for the same period  interest income  net of premium amortization  was approximately million  and was primarily earned from investments in mortgage backed securities 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million and was primarily due to costs on short term borrowings 
for the period from april  through december   net income was million or per weighted average share basic and diluted 
for the same period  interest income  net of premium amortization  was approximately million  and was primarily earned from investments in mortgage 
table of contents backed securities 
interest expense on short term borrowings was million 
because of the timing of our initial investment of portfolio assets investment activities began on june  as well as the timing of our initial public offering proceeds were received on december   interest income and interest expense for the period from april  through december  was substantially lower than the full year of operations in  both in an absolute sense and also relative to the average net invested assets for the period 
in addition  prepayment activity declined in due to the changing interest rate environment and resulted in decreased premium amortization and increased yield on average earning assets 
for the year ended december   the weighted average yield on average earning assets  net of amortization of premium  was  and the cost of funds on our repurchase agreement liabilities was  resulting in a net interest spread of

accounting policy  which is used to measure hedge ineffectiveness on our eurodollar futures contracts 
we changed the term of our forecasted repurchase agreement liabilities to conform more closely with common industry issuance terms 
we do not anticipate further changes to the term of our forecasted repurchase agreement liabilities  and therefore we believe that we will incur no future ineffectiveness from this change 
as required by sfas no 
 we recognized one time gains of million in the form of hedge ineffectiveness on our eurodollar futures contracts during the three months ended june  the impact of this recognition was that a portion of the liabilities we had hedged in anticipation of rising interest rates were recognized as gains or offsets to our interest expense in the second quarter of the remaining net ineffectiveness gains at december  relate to our cash flow hedges 
at december   the maximum length of time over which we were hedging our exposure was months compared to months at december  no net hedge ineffectiveness gains or losses were recognized in 
table of contents average repurchase agreement liabilities during the year ended december  and the period from june  through december  were billion and billion  respectively 
other income of million for the year ended december  represents a one time gain on the termination of certain repurchase agreements that was initiated by our counterparty  federal home loan mortgage corporation 
we had no other income for the period from april  through december  net losses on sales of mortgage backed securities of million are included in net income for the period from april  through december  between june  and mid august  the us bond markets experienced dramatic price and yield volatility 
increasing interest rates caused the overall market value of our portfolio to decrease and our leverage defined as our total debt divided by stockholders equity to increase beyond management s desired range 
to reduce leverage  we sold securities in mid august totaling million and realized a loss of million 
in an attempt to protect our portfolio from further increases in interest rates  we sold short million of tba mortgage securities 
interest rates subsequently declined  and we closed out this short position in the month of september for a total realized loss of million 
during the third quarter of  we also simultaneously sold and purchased securities totaling million and million  respectively  that resulted in a realized gain on sale of million 
we did not sell any mortgage backed securities during the period from april  through june  or during the quarter ended december   therefore  there were no gains or losses on sales of securities for these periods 
in addition  we did not sell any mortgage backed securities during the year ended december  although we generally intend to hold our investment securities to maturity  seneca may determine at some time before they mature that it is in our interest to sell them and purchase securities with other characteristics 
in that event  our earnings will be affected by realized gains or losses 
operating expenses for the year ended december  and the period from april  through december  were million and million  respectively  for an increase of million 
the increase in operating expenses in is primarily due to a full year of operations versus a partial year in operating expenses in were high in proportion to gross interest income and expense and to net interest income as compared to the same proportions for the full year of operations in primarily due to start up costs 
base management fees to seneca under the management agreement  which were million and million for the year ended december  and the period from april  through december   respectively  are based on a percentage of our average net worth 
average net worth for these purposes is calculated on a monthly basis and equals the difference between the aggregate book value of our consolidated assets prior to accumulated depreciation and other non cash items  including the fair market value adjustment on mortgage backed securities  minus the aggregate book value of our consolidated liabilities 
incentive compensation expense to related parties for the year ended december  and the period from april  through december  was million and million  respectively 
incentive compensation is earned by related parties when reit taxable net income before deducting incentive compensation  net operating losses and certain other items relative to the average net invested assets for the period  as defined in the management agreement  exceeds the threshold return taxable income that would have produced an annualized return on equity equal to the sum of the year us treasury rate plus for the same period 
for the year ended december   total incentive compensation earned by seneca was million  one half payable in cash and one half payable in the form of a restricted common stock award 
the cash portion of the incentive compensation of million for the year ended december  was expensed in that period as well as of the restricted common stock portion of the incentive compensation  or thousand 
in accordance with the terms of his employment agreement  our chief financial officer earned incentive compensation for the year ended december  of thousand 
this incentive compensation is also payable one half in cash and one half in the form of a restricted common stock award under our stock incentive plan 
the shares are payable and vest over the same vesting schedule as the stock issued to 
table of contents seneca 
the cash portion of the incentive compensation of thousand for the year ended december  was expensed in that period as well as of the restricted common stock portion of the incentive compensation  or thousand 
the remaining incentive compensation expense of thousand for the year ended december  relates primarily to restricted common stock awards vested during the period 
for the period from april  through december   total incentive compensation earned by seneca was million  of which thousand was waived by seneca for the quarter ended september  the remaining incentive compensation of thousand was one half payable in cash and one half payable in the form of restricted common stock 
the cash portion of the incentive compensation of thousand for the quarter ended december  was expensed in that period as well as of the restricted common stock portion of the incentive compensation  or thousand 
in accordance with the terms of his employment agreement  our chief financial officer earned incentive compensation for the quarter ended december  of thousand 
this incentive compensation is also payable one half in cash and one half in the form of a restricted common stock award under our stock incentive plan 
the shares are payable and vest over the same vesting schedule as the stock issued to seneca 
the cash portion of the incentive compensation of thousand for the quarter ended december  was expensed in that period as well as of the restricted common stock portion of the incentive compensation  or thousand 
for the period from april  through june   reit taxable net income before deducting incentive compensation  net operating losses and certain other items was thousand and was less than the threshold return net income of thousand and  therefore  no incentive compensation was earned by seneca or paid by the company for that period 
the company also did not pay incentive compensation to seneca for the three months ended september  although the company reported a net loss for the three months ended september  of million  reit taxable net income before deducting incentive compensation  net operating losses and certain other items was million and was greater than the threshold return taxable income of million and  therefore  an incentive compensation of thousand was earned by seneca 
although seneca was entitled to receive incentive compensation under the management agreement for the three months ended september   because of the net loss reported by the company for the period  seneca voluntarily waived  on a one time basis  its right to incentive compensation for the period 
since seneca waived its right to its incentive compensation for the three months ended september   the waived incentive compensation has been accounted for as a capital contribution as of september  the incentive compensation of thousand was expensed in the three months ended september  salaries and benefits expense for the year ended december  and for the period from april  through december  was thousand and thousand  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to salaries and benefits paid for a full year in as well as performance bonuses paid in professional services expense for the year ended december  and the period from april  through december  of million and million  respectively  includes legal  accounting and other professional services provided to us 
insurance expense for the year ended december  and the period from april  through december  of thousand and thousand  respectively  consisting primarily of premium for directors and officers insurance 
custody expense of thousand and thousand for the year ended december  and the period from april  through december   respectively  is related to the services provided by our primary custodian 
these expenses may vary based on levels of activity within the portfolio 
other general and administrative expenses of thousand and thousand for the year ended december  and the period from april  through december   respectively 
the increase in other general and administrative expenses is primarily due to printing costs incurred in the first and second quarters of related to the filing of our resale shelf registration statement  our annual report and proxy and nyse listing fees 

table of contents reit taxable net income is calculated according to the requirements of the internal revenue code  rather than gaap

there are limitations associated with reit taxable net income  and by itself it is an incomplete measure of our financial performance over any period 
as a result  our reit taxable net income should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for  our gaap based net income as a measure of our financial performance 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments as of december  and  our day to day operations were externally managed pursuant to a management agreement with seneca  subject to the direction and oversight of our board of directors 
see note to the financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for significant terms of the management agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements since inception  we have not maintained any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
further  we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitment or intent to provide additional funding to any such entities 
accordingly  we are not materially exposed to any market  credit  liquidity or financing risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of funds as of december  consisted of repurchase agreements totaling billion with a weighted average current borrowing rate of  which we used to finance acquisition of mortgage related assets 
we expect to continue to borrow funds in the form of repurchase agreements 
as of december  we had established borrowing arrangements with various investment banking firms and other lenders  of which were in use on december  increases in short term interest rates could negatively impact the valuation of our mortgage related assets  which could limit our borrowing ability or cause our lenders to initiate margin calls 
amounts due upon maturity of our repurchase agreements will be funded primarily through the rollover reissuance of repurchase agreements and monthly principal and interest payments received on our mortgage backed securities 
we generally seek to borrow between eight and times the amount of our equity 
our leverage ratio at december  was we actively manage the adjustment periods and the selection of the interest rate indices of our borrowings against the interest rate adjustment periods and the selection of indices on our mortgage related assets in order to manage our liquidity and interest rate related risks 
we may also choose to engage in various hedging activities designed to match more closely the terms of our assets and liabilities 
we have a margin lending facility with our primary custodian from which we may borrow money in connection with the purchase or sale of securities 
the terms of the borrowings  including the rate of interest payable  are agreed to with the custodian for each amount borrowed 
borrowings are repayable immediately upon demand of the custodian 
at december   there were no outstanding borrowings under the margin lending facility 
for liquidity  we also rely on the cash flow from operations  primarily monthly principal and interest payments received on our mortgage backed securities  as well as any primary securities offerings authorized by our board of directors 
on april   we paid a cash distribution of per share to our stockholders of record on march  the distribution was paid to stockholders of the  shares outstanding on the record date  which was prior to the completion of our march  public offering 
on august   we paid a cash distribution of per share to our stockholders of record on july  on november  we paid a cash distribution of per share to our stockholders of record on october  on december  we declared a cash distribution of per share to our stockholders of record on december  we paid the distribution on january  the distributions are taxable dividends and are not considered a return of capital 
distributions are funded with cash flows from our ongoing operations  including principal and interest payments received on our mortgage backed securities 
we did not distribute million of our reit taxable net income for the year ended december  we intend to declare a spillback distribution in this amount during we did not distribute thousand of our reit taxable net income for the period from april  through 
table of contents december  during  a spillback distribution in this amount was approved by our board of directors 
we believe that equity capital  combined with the cash flow from operations and the utilization of borrowings  will be sufficient to enable us to meet anticipated liquidity requirements 
however  an increase in prepayment rates substantially above our expectations could cause a liquidity shortfall 
if our cash resources are at any time insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may be required to liquidate mortgage backed securities or sell debt or additional equity securities 
if required  the sale of mortgage backed securities at prices lower than the carrying value of such assets would result in losses and reduced income 
during the year ended december   we had adequate cash flow  liquid assets and unpledged collateral with which to meet our margin requirements 
in march  we completed an offering of  shares of common stock  and received aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
we intend to increase our capital resources by making additional offerings of equity and debt securities  possibly including classes of preferred stock  common stock  commercial paper  medium term notes  collateralized mortgage obligations and senior or subordinated notes 
such financing will depend on market conditions for capital raises and for the investment of any proceeds therefrom 
all debt securities  other borrowings  and classes of preferred stock will be senior to the common stock in a liquidation of our company 
in february  the company entered into a controlled equity offering sales agreement with cantor fitzgerald co  pursuant to the shelf registration statement on form s filed on january  see note to our financial statements in item of this annual report on form k for further discussion 
inflation virtually all of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  interest rates and other factors influence our performance far more so than does inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and our distributions are determined by our board of directors primarily based on our net income as calculated for tax purposes  in each case  our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost and or fair market value without considering inflation 
risk factors risks related to our business interest rate mismatches between our mortgage backed securities and the borrowings used to fund our purchases of mortgage backed securities might reduce our net income or result in losses during periods of changing interest rates 
we invest primarily in adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
the mortgages underlying these adjustable rate mortgage backed securities have interest rates that reset periodically  typically every six months or on an annual basis  based upon market based indices of interest rates such as us treasury bonds or libor  the interest rate that banks in london offer for deposits in london of us dollars 
the mortgages underlying hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities have interest rates that are fixed for the first few years of the loan typically three  five  seven or years and thereafter their interest rates reset periodically similar to the mortgages underlying adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
we have funded our acquisitions  and expect to fund our future acquisitions  of adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities in part with borrowings that have interest rates based on indices and repricing terms similar to  but with shorter maturities than  the interest rate indices and repricing terms of our adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
on december   of our investment portfolio was invested in adjustable rate or hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities having a weighted average term to next rate adjustment of approximately months  while our borrowings 
table of contents had a weighted average term to next rate adjustment of approximately days 
after consideration of the duration on our eurodollar futures and interest rate swap contracts  our weighted average maturity of our total liabilities was days 
the phrase weighted average term to next rate adjustment refers to the average of the periods of time that must elapse before the interest rates adjust for all of the mortgages underlying our adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities in our portfolio  which average is weighted in proportion to the book values of the applicable securities 
during periods of changing interest rates  this interest rate mismatch between our assets and liabilities could reduce or eliminate our net income and distributions to our stockholders and could cause us to suffer a loss 
accordingly  in a period of rising interest rates  we could experience a decrease in  or elimination of  our net income or a net loss because the interest rates on our borrowings could increase faster than the interest rates on our adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
conversely  in a period of declining interest rates  we could experience a decrease in  or elimination of  our net income or a net loss because our amortization of premiums could increase 
increased levels of prepayments on the mortgages underlying our mortgage backed securities might decrease our net interest income or result in a net loss 
the mortgage backed securities that we acquire generally represent interests in pools of mortgage loans 
the principal and interest payments we receive from our mortgage backed securities are generally funded by the payments that mortgage borrowers make on those underlying mortgage loans 
when borrowers prepay their mortgage loans sooner than expected  corresponding prepayments on the mortgage backed securities occur sooner than expected by the marketplace 
sooner than expected prepayments could harm our results of operations in the following ways  among others we seek to purchase mortgage backed securities that we believe to have favorable risk adjusted expected returns relative to market interest rates at the time of purchase 
if the coupon interest rate for a mortgage backed security is higher than the market interest rate at the time it is purchased  then that mortgage backed security will be acquired at a premium to its par value 
in accordance with applicable accounting rules  we are required to amortize any premiums or accrete discounts related to our mortgage backed securities over their expected terms 
the amortization of a premium reduces interest income  while the accretion of a discount increases interest income 
the expected terms for mortgage backed securities are a function of the prepayment rates for the mortgages underlying the mortgage backed securities 
mortgage backed securities that are at a premium to their par value are more likely to experience prepayment of some or all of their principal through refinancings 
if the mortgages underlying our mortgage backed securities purchased at a premium are prepaid in whole or in part more quickly than their respective maturity dates  then we must also amortize their respective premiums more quickly  which would decrease our net interest income and harm our profitability 
a substantial portion of our adjustable rate mortgage backed securities may bear interest at rates that are lower than their fully indexed rates  which refers to their applicable index rates plus a margin 
if an adjustable rate mortgage backed security is prepaid prior to or soon after the time of adjustment to a fully indexed rate  we will have held that mortgage backed security while it was less profitable and lost the opportunity to receive interest at the fully indexed rate over the remainder of its expected life 
if we are unable to acquire new mortgage backed securities to replace the prepaid mortgage backed securities  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow may suffer and we could incur losses 
prepayment rates generally increase when interest rates decline and decrease when interest rates rise  however  changes in prepayment rates may lag behind changes in interest rates and are difficult to predict 
prepayment rates also may be affected by other factors  including  without limitation  conditions in the housing and financial markets  general economic conditions and the relative interest rates on adjustable rate and fixed rate mortgage loans 
while we seek to minimize prepayment risk  we must balance prepayment risk 
table of contents against other risks and the potential returns of each investment when selecting investments 
no strategy can completely insulate us from prepayment or other such risks 
we depend on short term borrowings to purchase mortgage related assets and reach our desired amount of leverage 
if we fail to obtain or renew sufficient funding on favorable terms or at all  we will be limited in our ability to acquire mortgage related assets  which will harm our results of operations 
we depend on short term borrowings to fund acquisitions of mortgage related assets and reach our desired amount of leverage 
accordingly  our ability to achieve our investment and leverage objectives depends on our ability to borrow money in sufficient amounts and on favorable terms 
in addition  we must be able to renew or replace our maturing short term borrowings on a continuous basis 
we depend on a few lenders to provide the primary credit facilities for our purchases of mortgage related assets 
in addition  our existing indebtedness may limit our ability to make additional borrowings 
if our lenders do not allow us to renew our borrowings or we cannot replace maturing borrowings on favorable terms or at all  we might have to sell our mortgage related assets under adverse market conditions  which would harm our results of operations and may result in losses 
our leverage strategy increases the risks of our operations  which could reduce our net income and the amount available for distributions or cause us to suffer a loss 
we generally seek to borrow between eight and times the amount of our equity  although at times our borrowings may be above or below this amount 
we incur this indebtedness by borrowing against a substantial portion of the market value of our mortgage backed securities 
our total indebtedness  however  is not expressly limited by our policies and depends on our and our prospective lender s estimate of the stability of our portfolio s cash flow 
we face the risk that we might not be able to meet our debt service obligations or a lender s margin requirements from our income and  to the extent we cannot  we might be forced to liquidate some of our assets at disadvantageous prices 
our use of leverage amplifies the risks associated with other risk factors  which could reduce our net income and the amount available for distributions or cause us to suffer a loss 
for example a majority of our borrowings are secured by our mortgage backed securities  generally under repurchase agreements 
a decline in the market value of our mortgage backed securities used to secure these debt obligations could limit our ability to borrow or result in lenders requiring us to pledge additional collateral to secure our borrowings 
in that situation  we could be required to sell mortgage backed securities under adverse market conditions in order to obtain the additional collateral required by the lender 
if these sales are made at prices lower than the carrying value of our mortgage backed securities  we would experience losses 
a default under a mortgage related asset that constitutes collateral for a loan could also result in an involuntary liquidation of the mortgage related asset  including any cross collateralized mortgage backed securities 
this circumstance would result in a loss to us to the extent that the value of our mortgage related asset upon liquidation is less than the amount we borrowed against the mortgage related asset 
to the extent we are compelled to liquidate qualified reit assets to repay our debts or further collateralize them  our compliance with the reit rules regarding our assets and our sources of income could be negatively affected  which could jeopardize our status as a reit 
losing our reit status would cause us to lose tax advantages applicable to reits and would decrease our overall profitability and our distributions to our stockholders 
if we experience losses as a result of our leverage policy  such losses would reduce the amounts available for distribution to our stockholders 

table of contents we may incur increased borrowing costs related to repurchase agreements that would harm our results of operations 
our borrowing costs under repurchase agreements are generally adjustable and correspond to short term interest rates  such as libor or a short term treasury index  plus or minus a margin 
the margins on these borrowings over or under short term interest rates may vary depending upon a number of factors  including  without limitation  the following the movement of interest rates  the availability of financing in the market  and the value and liquidity of our mortgage backed securities 
most of our borrowings are collateralized borrowings in the form of repurchase agreements 
if the interest rates on these repurchase agreements increase  our results of operations will be harmed and we may have losses 
we have only been in business since june and our implementation of our operating policies and strategies may not continue to be successful 
we began operations in june  and therefore have a limited operating history 
our results of operations depend on many factors  including the availability of opportunities to acquire mortgage related assets  the level and volatility of interest rates  readily accessible short and long term funding alternatives in the financial markets and economic conditions 
moreover  delays in fully leveraging and investing the net proceeds of our public offerings may cause our performance to be weaker than other fully leveraged and invested mortgage reits pursuing comparable investment strategies 
furthermore  we face the risk that our implementation of our operating policies and strategies may not continue to be successful 
our board of directors may change our operating policies and strategies without stockholder approval or prior notice and such changes could harm our business and results of operations and the value of our stock 
our board of directors has the authority to modify or waive our current operating policies and our strategies  including our election to operate as a reit  without prior notice and without stockholder approval 
we cannot predict the effect any changes to our current operating policies and strategies would have on our business  operating results and value of our stock 
however  the effects might be adverse 
we depend on our key personnel  and the loss of any of our key personnel could severely and detrimentally affect our operations 
we depend on the diligence  experience and skill of our officers and the seneca personnel who provide management services to us for the selection  acquisition  structuring  monitoring and sale of our mortgage related assets and the borrowings used to acquire these assets 
our key officers include gail p 
seneca  albert j 
gutierrez  christopher j 
zyda and andrew s 
chow 
we have not entered into employment agreements with our key officers other than mr 
zyda  who is our senior vice president and chief financial officer 
with the exception of mr 
zyda  none of our senior officers  including ms 
seneca and messrs 
gutierrez and chow  devote all of their business time to our business and are free to engage in competitive activities in our industry 
in addition  our management agreement with seneca pursuant to which ms 
seneca and messrs 
gutierrez and chow provide management services to us is terminable by seneca at any time upon days notice 
the loss of our key officers or the termination of our management agreement with seneca could harm our business  financial condition  cash flow and results of operations 

table of contents competition might prevent us from acquiring mortgage backed securities at favorable yields  which would harm our results of operations 
our net income depends on our ability to acquire mortgage backed securities at favorable spreads over our borrowing costs 
in acquiring mortgage backed securities  we compete with other reits  investment banking firms  savings and loan associations  banks  insurance companies  mutual funds  other lenders and other entities that purchase mortgage backed securities  many of which have greater financial resources than we do 
as a result  we may not be able to acquire sufficient mortgage backed securities at favorable spreads over our borrowing costs  which would harm our results of operations 
interest rate caps related to our mortgage backed securities may reduce our net income or cause us to suffer a loss during periods of rising interest rates 
the mortgages underlying our mortgage backed securities are typically subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps 
periodic interest rate caps limit the amount that the interest rate of a mortgage can increase during any given period 
lifetime interest rate caps limit the amount an interest rate can increase through the maturity of a mortgage 
at december   of our mortgage backed securities were based on adjustable rate or hybrid adjustable rate mortgages  of which were subject to interest rate caps 
as of that same date  the percentage of adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities in our investment portfolio which are subject to periodic interest rate caps every six months or annually were and  respectively 
our borrowings are not subject to similar restrictions 
the periodic adjustments to the interest rates of the mortgages underlying our mortgage backed securities are based on changes in an objective index 
substantially all of the mortgages underlying our mortgage backed securities adjust their interest rates based on one of two main indices  the us treasury index  which is a monthly or weekly average yield of benchmark us treasury securities published by the federal reserve board  or libor 
the percentages of the mortgages underlying the adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities in our investment portfolio at december  with interest rates that reset based on the us treasury or libor indices were and  respectively 
accordingly  in a period of rapidly increasing interest rates  the interest rates paid on our borrowings could increase without limitation while interest rate caps could limit the increases in the yields on our mortgage backed securities 
this problem is magnified for mortgage backed securities that are not fully indexed 
further  some of the mortgages underlying our mortgage backed securities may be subject to periodic payment caps that result in a portion of the interest being deferred and added to the principal outstanding 
as a result  we may receive less cash income on our mortgage backed securities than we need to pay interest on our related borrowings 
these factors could reduce our net interest income or cause us to suffer a net loss 
we might experience reduced net interest income or a loss from holding fixed rate investments during periods of rising interest rates 
a significant portion of our investment portfolio consists of hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
at december   of our investment portfolio consisted of hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
we may also invest in fixed rate mortgage backed securities from time to time  however  at december   none of our portfolio consisted of fixed rate mortgage backed securities 
we fund our acquisition of fixed rate mortgage backed securities  including those based on balloon maturity and hybrid adjustable rate mortgages  in part with short term repurchase agreements and term loans 
during periods of rising interest rates  our costs associated with borrowings used to fund the acquisition of fixed rate mortgage backed securities are subject to increases  while the income we earn from these assets remains substantially fixed 
the reduction or elimination of the net interest spread between the fixed rate mortgage backed securities that we purchase and our borrowings used to purchase them would reduce our net interest income and could cause us to suffer a loss 

table of contents we might not be able to use derivatives to mitigate our interest rate and prepayment risks 
our policies permit us to enter into interest rate swaps  caps and floors and other derivative transactions in an effort to reduce our interest rate and prepayment risks 
these transactions might mitigate our interest rate and prepayment risks  but cannot eliminate these risks 
moreover  the use of derivative transactions could have a negative impact on our net income and our status as a reit and  therefore  our use of such derivatives could be limited 
we may enter into ineffective derivative transactions or other hedging activities that may reduce our net interest rate spread or cause us to suffer losses 
our policies permit us  but we are not required  to enter into derivative transactions such as interest rate swaps  caps and floors and other derivative transactions to help us seek to reduce our interest rate and prepayment risks 
the effectiveness of any derivative transaction will depend significantly upon whether we correctly quantify the interest rate or prepayment risks being hedged  our execution of and ongoing monitoring of our hedging activities and the treatment of such hedging activities under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap 
in the case of these hedges  and any other efforts to mitigate the effects of interest rate changes on our liability costs  if we enter into hedging instruments that have higher interest rates embedded in them as a result of the forward yield curve  and at the end of the term of these hedging instruments the spot market interest rates for the liabilities that we hedged are actually lower  then we will have locked in higher interest rates for our liabilities than would be available in the spot market at the time  which could result in a narrowing of our net interest rate spread or result in losses 
in some situations  we may sell assets or hedging instruments at a loss in order to maintain adequate liquidity 
in addition  we apply statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted  and record derivatives at fair value 
if the derivatives meet the criteria to be accounted for as hedging transactions  the effects of the transactions could be materially different as to timing than if they do not qualify as hedges  which may cause a narrowing of our net interest rate spread or result in losses 
an increase in interest rates might adversely affect our book value 
we use changes in year us treasury yields as a reference indicator for changes in interest rates because it is a common market benchmark 
increases in the general level of interest rates can cause the fair market value of our assets to decline  particularly those mortgage backed securities whose underlying mortgages have fixed rate components 
our fixed rate mortgage backed securities and our hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities during the fixed rate component of the mortgages underlying such securities will generally be more negatively affected by such increases than our adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
in accordance with gaap  we will be required to reduce the carrying value of our mortgage backed securities by the amount of any decrease in the fair value of our mortgage backed securities compared to their respective amortized costs 
if unrealized losses in fair value occur  we will have to either reduce current earnings or reduce stockholders equity without immediately affecting current earnings  depending on how we classify such mortgage backed securities under gaap 
in either case  our net book value will decrease to the extent of any realized or unrealized losses in fair value 
we may invest in leveraged mortgage derivative securities that generally experience greater volatility in market prices  and thus expose us to greater risk with respect to their rate of return 
we may acquire leveraged mortgage derivative securities that expose us to a high level of interest rate risk 
the characteristics of leveraged mortgage derivative securities cause those securities to experience greater volatility in their market prices 
thus  acquisition of leveraged mortgage derivative securities will expose us to the risk of greater volatility in our portfolio  which could reduce our net income and harm our overall results of operations 

table of contents possible market developments could cause our lenders to require us to pledge additional assets as collateral 
if our assets are insufficient to meet the collateral requirements  we might be compelled to liquidate particular assets at inopportune times and at disadvantageous prices 
possible market developments  including a sharp or prolonged rise in interest rates  an increase in prepayment rates or increasing market concern about the value or liquidity of one or more types of mortgage backed securities in which our portfolio is concentrated  might reduce the market value of our portfolio  which might cause our lenders to require additional collateral 
any requirement for additional collateral might compel us to liquidate our assets at inopportune times and at disadvantageous prices  thereby harming our operating results 
if we sell our mortgage backed securities at prices lower than their carrying value  we would experience losses 
because the assets that we acquire might experience periods of illiquidity  we might be prevented from selling our mortgage related assets at opportune times and prices 
we bear the risk of being unable to dispose of our mortgage related assets at advantageous times and prices or in a timely manner because mortgage related assets generally experience periods of illiquidity 
the lack of liquidity might result from the absence of a willing buyer or an established market for these assets  as well as legal or contractual restrictions on resale 
if we are unable to sell our mortgage related assets at opportune times  we might suffer a loss and or reduce our distributions 
we remain subject to losses despite our strategy of investing in highly rated mortgage backed securities 
our investment guidelines provide that at least of our assets must be invested in mortgage backed securities that are either agency backed or are rated at least investment grade by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating agency 
while highly rated mortgage backed securities are generally subject to a lower risk of default than lower credit quality mortgage backed securities and may benefit from third party credit enhancements such as insurance or corporate guarantees  there is no assurance that such mortgage backed securities will not be subject to credit losses 
furthermore  ratings are subject to change over time as a result of a number of factors  including greater than expected delinquencies  defaults or credit losses or a deterioration in the financial strength of corporate guarantors  any of which may reduce the market value of such securities 
furthermore  ratings do not take into account the reasonableness of the issue price  interest risks  prepayment risks  extension risks or other risks associated with such mortgage backed securities 
as a result  while we attempt to mitigate our exposure to credit risk on a relative basis by focusing on highly rated mortgage backed securities  we cannot eliminate such credit risks and remain subject to other risks to our investment portfolio and may suffer losses  which may harm the market price of our common stock 
our investment guidelines permit us to invest up to of our assets in unrated mortgage related assets and mortgage backed securities rated below investment grade  which carry a greater likelihood of default or rating downgrade than investments in investment grade mortgage backed securities and may cause us to suffer losses 
our investment guidelines allow us to invest up to of our assets in lower credit quality mortgage related assets  including mortgage backed securities that are not rated at least investment grade by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization  and other investments such as leveraged mortgage derivative securities  shares of other reits  mortgage loans or other mortgage related investments 
if we acquire non investment grade mortgage backed securities  which may include residual mortgage backed securities  we are more likely to incur losses because the mortgages underlying those securities are made to borrowers possessing lower quality credit 
while all mortgage backed securities are subject to a risk of default  that risk is greater with non investment grade mortgage backed securities 
in addition  the rating agencies are more likely to downgrade the credit quality of those securities  which would reduce the value of those securities 

table of contents our use of repurchase agreements to borrow funds may give our lenders greater rights in the event that either we or any of our lenders file for bankruptcy 
our borrowings under repurchase agreements may qualify for special treatment under the bankruptcy code  giving our lenders the ability to avoid the automatic stay provisions of the bankruptcy code and to take possession of and liquidate our collateral under the repurchase agreements without delay if we file for bankruptcy 
furthermore  the special treatment of repurchase agreements under the bankruptcy code may make it difficult for us to recover our pledged assets in the event that any of our lenders files for bankruptcy 
thus  the use of repurchase agreements exposes our pledged assets to risk in the event of a bankruptcy filing by any of our lenders or us 
defaults on the mortgage loans underlying our mortgage backed securities may reduce the value of our investment portfolio and may harm our results of operations 
we bear the risk of any losses resulting from any defaults on the mortgage loans underlying the mortgage backed securities in our investment portfolio 
many of the mortgage backed securities that we acquire have one or more forms of credit enhancement provided by third parties  such as insurance against risk of loss due to default on the underlying mortgage loans or bankruptcy  fraud and special hazard losses 
to the extent that third parties have agreed to insure against these types of losses  the value of such insurance will depend in part on the creditworthiness and claims paying ability of the insurer and the timeliness of reimbursement in the event of a default on the underlying obligations 
further  the insurance coverage for various types of losses is limited in amount  and we would bear losses in excess of these limitations 
other mortgage backed securities that we purchase are subject to limited guarantees of the payment of limited amounts of principal and interest on mortgage loans underlying such mortgage backed securities  either by federal government agencies  including ginnie mae  by federally chartered corporations  including fannie mae and freddie mac  or by other corporate guarantors 
while ginnie mae s obligations are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states  the obligations of fannie mae and freddie mac and other corporate guarantors are solely their own 
as a result  a substantial deterioration in the financial strength of fannie mae  freddie mac or other corporate guarantors could increase our exposure to future delinquencies  defaults or credit losses on our holdings of fannie mae or freddie mac backed mortgage backed securities or other corporate backed mortgage backed securities  and could harm our results of operations 
in addition  while freddie mac guarantees the eventual payment of principal  it does not guarantee the timely payment thereof  and our results of operations may be harmed if borrowers are late or delinquent in their payments on mortgages underlying freddie mac backed mortgage backed securities 
moreover  fannie mae  freddie mac  ginnie mae and other corporate guarantees relate only to payments of limited amounts of principal and interest on the mortgages underlying such agency backed or corporate backed securities  and do not guarantee the market value of such mortgage backed securities or the yields on such mortgage backed securities 
as a result  we remain subject to interest rate risks  prepayment risks  extension risks and other risks associated with our investment in such mortgage backed securities and may experience losses in our investment portfolio 
decreases in the value of the property underlying our mortgage backed securities might decrease the value of our assets 
the mortgage backed securities in which we invest are secured by underlying real property interests 
to the extent that the value of the property underlying our mortgage backed securities decreases  our security might be impaired  which might decrease the value of our assets 
insurance will not cover all potential losses on the underlying real property and the absence thereof may harm the value of our assets 
under our asset acquisition policy  we are permitted to invest up to a maximum of of our total assets in assets other than agency backed securities  or rated as at least investment grade by a nationally recognized statistical rating agency 
mortgage loans that fall outside of this category of investments under our investment guidelines are subject to the limitation 
if we elect to purchase mortgage loans  we may require that each 
table of contents of the mortgage loans that we purchase include comprehensive insurance covering the underlying real property  including liability  fire and extended coverage 
certain types of losses  however  generally of a catastrophic nature  such as earthquakes  floods and hurricanes  may be uninsurable or not economically insurable 
inflation  changes in building codes and ordinances  environmental considerations and other factors might also make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property if it is damaged or destroyed 
under such circumstances  the insurance proceeds  if any  might not be adequate to restore the economic value of the underlying real property  which might impair our security and decrease the value of our assets 
distressed mortgage loans have a higher risk of future default 
if we elect to purchase mortgage loans  we may purchase distressed mortgage loans as well as mortgage loans that have had a history of delinquencies 
these distressed mortgage loans may be in default or may have a greater than normal risk of future defaults and delinquencies  compared to a pool of newly originated  high quality loans of comparable type  size and geographic concentration 
returns on an investment of this type depend on accurate pricing of such investment  the borrower s ability to make required payments or  in the event of default  the ability of the loan s servicer to foreclose and liquidate the mortgage loan 
we cannot assure you that the servicer will be able to liquidate a defaulted mortgage loan in a cost effective manner  at an advantageous price or in a timely manner 
subordinated loans on real estate are subject to higher risks 
if we elect to purchase mortgage loans  we may acquire loans secured by commercial properties  including loans that are subordinated to first liens on the underlying commercial real estate 
subordinated mortgage loans are subject to greater risks of loss than first lien mortgage loans 
an overall decline in the real estate market could reduce the value of the real property securing such loans such that the aggregate outstanding balance of the second lien loan and the outstanding balance of the more senior loan on the real property exceed the value of the real property 
risks related to seneca we pay seneca incentive compensation based on our portfolio s performance 
this arrangement may lead seneca to recommend riskier or more speculative investments in an effort to maximize its incentive compensation 
in addition to its base management fee  seneca earns incentive compensation for each fiscal quarter equal to a specified percentage of the amount by which our taxable income  before deducting incentive compensation  exceeds a return on equity based on the year us treasury rate plus 
the percentage for this calculation is the weighted average of the following percentages based on our average net invested assets for the fiscal quarter for the first million of our average net invested assets  and of our average net invested assets in excess of million 
pursuant to the formula for calculating seneca s incentive compensation  seneca shares in our profits but not in our losses 
consequently  as seneca evaluates different mortgage backed securities and other investments for our account  there is a risk that seneca will cause us to assume more risk than is prudent in an attempt to increase its incentive compensation 
other key criteria related to determining appropriate investments and investment strategies  including the preservation of capital  might be under weighted if seneca focuses exclusively or disproportionately on maximizing its incentive income from us 
we may be obligated to pay seneca incentive compensation even if we incur a loss 
pursuant to the management agreement  seneca is entitled to receive incentive compensation for each fiscal quarter in an amount equal to a tiered percentage of the excess of our taxable income for that quarter before deducting incentive compensation  net operating losses and certain other items above a threshold return for that quarter 
in addition  the management agreement further provides that our taxable income for 
table of contents incentive compensation purposes excludes net capital losses that we may incur in the fiscal quarter  even if such capital losses result in us incurring net loss for that quarter 
thus  we may be required to pay seneca incentive compensation for a fiscal quarter even if there is a decline in the value of our portfolio or we incur a net loss for that quarter 
because seneca is entitled to a significant fee if we terminate the management agreement  economic considerations might preclude us from terminating the management agreement in the event that seneca fails to meet our expectations 
from time to time  we will assess whether we should be internally managed 
in may  our board of directors formed a committee of independent directors to assess the advisability of internalization and this assessment is currently ongoing 
if we terminate the management agreement without cause or because we decide to manage our company internally or if seneca terminates the management in the event of a change of control  then we will have to pay a significant fee to seneca 
the amount of the fee depends on whether we terminate the management agreement without cause in connection with a decision to manage our portfolio internally  in which case we will be obligated to pay to seneca a fee equal to the highest amount of management fee incurred in a particular year during the then three most recent years  or our decision to terminate the management agreement without cause is for a reason other than our decision to manage our portfolio internally  in which case we will be obligated to pay seneca an amount equal to two times the highest amount of management fee incurred in a particular year during the then three most recent years 
in each of the above cases  seneca will also receive accelerated vesting of the stock component of its incentive compensation 
the actual amount of such fee cannot be known at this time because it is based in part on the performance of our portfolio of mortgage backed securities 
paying this fee would reduce significantly the cash available for distribution to our stockholders and might cause us to suffer a net operating loss 
consequently  terminating the management agreement might not be advisable even if we determine that it would be more efficient to operate with an internal management structure or if we are otherwise dissatisfied with seneca s performance 
seneca s liability is limited under the management agreement  and we have agreed to indemnify seneca against certain liabilities 
seneca has not assumed any responsibility to us other than to render the services described in the management agreement  and is not responsible for any action of our board of directors in declining to follow seneca s advice or recommendations 
seneca and its directors  officers and employees will not be liable to us for acts performed by its officers  directors or employees in accordance with and pursuant to the management agreement  except for acts constituting gross negligence  recklessness  willful misconduct or active fraud in connection with their duties under the management agreement 
we have agreed to indemnify seneca and its directors  officers and employees with respect to all expenses  losses  damages  liabilities  demands  charges and claims arising from acts of seneca not constituting gross negligence  recklessness  willful misconduct or active fraud 
seneca might allocate mortgage related opportunities to other entities  and thus might divert attractive investment opportunities away from us 
our operations and assets are managed by specified individuals at seneca 
seneca and those individuals  including some of our officers  manage mortgage and other portfolios for parties unrelated to us 
these multiple responsibilities might create conflicts of interest for seneca and these individuals if they are presented with opportunities that might benefit us and seneca s other clients 
seneca and these individuals must allocate investments among our portfolio and their other clients by determining the entity or account for which the investment is most suitable 
in making this determination  seneca and these individuals consider the investment strategy and guidelines of each entity or account with respect to the acquisition of assets  leverage  liquidity and other factors that seneca and these individuals determine to be appropriate 
however  seneca 
table of contents and those working on its behalf have no obligation to make any specific investment opportunities available to us and the above mentioned conflicts of interest might result in decisions or allocations of investments that are not in our or our stockholders best interests 
seneca may render services to other mortgage investors  which could reduce the amount of time and effort that seneca devotes to us 
our management agreement with seneca does not restrict the right of seneca or any persons working on its behalf to carry on their respective businesses  including the rendering of advice to others regarding the purchase of mortgage backed securities that would meet our investment criteria 
in addition  the management agreement does not specify a minimum time period that seneca and its personnel must devote to managing our investments 
the ability of seneca to engage in these other business activities  and specifically to manage mortgage related assets for third parties  could reduce the time and effort it spends managing our portfolio to the detriment of our investment returns 
seneca has significant influence over our affairs  and might cause us to engage in transactions that are not in our or our stockholders best interests 
in addition to managing us and having two of its officers as members of our board  seneca provides advice on our operating policies and strategies 
seneca may also cause us to engage in future transactions with seneca and its affiliates  subject to the approval of  or guidelines approved by  the independent members of our board of directors 
our directors  however  rely primarily on information supplied by seneca in reaching their determinations 
accordingly  seneca has significant influence over our affairs  and may cause us to engage in transactions that are not in our or our stockholders best interests 
seneca has limited experience managing a reit and we cannot assure you that seneca s past experience will be sufficient to manage our business as a reit successfully 
seneca has limited experience managing a reit  and limited experience in complying with the income  asset and other limitations imposed by the reit provisions of the internal revenue code 
those provisions are complex and the failure to comply with those provisions in a timely manner could cause us to lose our qualification as a reit or could force us to pay unexpected taxes and penalties 
in such event  our net income would be reduced and we could incur a loss 
during periods of declining market prices for our common stock  we may be required to issue greater numbers of shares to seneca for the same amount of incentive compensation arising under the management agreement  which will have a dilutive effect on our stockholders that may harm the market price of our common stock 
pursuant to the terms of the management agreement  the incentive compensation payable to seneca for each fiscal quarter is paid one half in cash and one half in restricted shares of our common stock 
the number of shares to be issued to seneca is based on a one half of the total incentive compensation for the period  divided by b the average of the closing prices of our common stock over the day period ending three calendar days prior to the grant date  less a fair market value discount determined by our board of directors on a quarterly basis 
during periods of declining market prices of our common stock  we may be required to issue more shares to seneca for the same amount of incentive compensation 
although these shares are subject to restrictions on transfer that lapse ratably over a three year period  the issuance of these shares will have a dilutive effect on our stockholders that may harm the market price of our common stock 
investors may not be able to estimate with certainty the aggregate fees and expense reimbursements that will be paid to seneca under the management agreement and the cost sharing agreement due to the time and manner in which seneca s incentive compensation and expense reimbursements are determined 
seneca may be entitled to substantial fees pursuant to the management agreement 
seneca s base management fee is calculated as a percentage of our average net worth 
seneca s incentive compensation is 
table of contents calculated as a tiered percentage of our taxable income  before deducting certain items  in excess of a threshold amount of taxable income and is indeterminable in advance of a particular period 
since future payments of base management fees  incentive compensation and expense reimbursements are determined at future dates based upon our then applicable average net worth  results of operations and actual expenses incurred by seneca  such fees and expense reimbursements cannot be estimated with mathematical certainty 
any base management fees  incentive compensation or expense reimbursements payable to seneca may be materially greater or less than the historical amounts and we can provide no assurance at this time as to the amount of any such base management fee  incentive compensation or expense reimbursements that may be payable to seneca in the future 
legal and tax risks if we are disqualified as a reit  we will be subject to tax as a regular corporation and face substantial tax liability 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex us federal income tax code provisions for which only a limited number of judicial or administrative interpretations exist 
accordingly  it is not certain we will be able to remain qualified as a reit for us federal income tax purposes 
even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status 
furthermore  congress or the internal revenue service the irs  might change tax laws or regulations and the courts might issue new rulings  in each case potentially having retroactive effect  that could make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a reit in a particular tax year 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any tax year  then we would be taxed as a regular domestic corporation  which  among other things  means that we would be unable to deduct distributions to stockholders in computing taxable income and we would be subject to us federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates  any resulting tax liability could be substantial  would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to stockholders  and could force us to liquidate assets at inopportune times  causing lower income or higher losses than would result if these assets were not liquidated  and unless we were entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions  we would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the subsequent four taxable years following the year during which we lost our qualification and  thus  our cash available for distribution to our stockholders would be reduced for each of the years during which we did not qualify as a reit 
even if we remain qualified as a reit  we might face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow 
further  we might be subject to federal  state and local taxes on our income and property 
any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distribution to our stockholders 
complying with reit requirements might cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 
in order to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes  we must satisfy tests concerning  among other things  our sources of income  the nature and diversification of our mortgage backed securities  the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock 
we may also be required to make distributions to our stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution 
thus  compliance with reit requirements may cause us to forego opportunities we would otherwise pursue 
in addition  the reit provisions of the internal revenue code impose a tax on income from prohibited transactions 
prohibited transactions generally include sales of assets that constitute inventory or other property held for sale in the ordinary course of a business  other than foreclosure property 
this tax could impact our desire to sell mortgage backed securities at otherwise opportune times if we believe such sales could be considered a prohibited transaction 

table of contents complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively 
the existing reit provisions of the internal revenue code substantially limit our ability to hedge mortgage backed securities and related borrowings 
under these provisions  our annual income from qualified hedges  together with any other income not generated from qualified reit real estate assets  is limited to less than of our gross income 
in addition  we must limit our aggregate income from hedging and services from all sources  other than from qualified reit real estate assets or qualified hedges  to less than of our annual gross income 
as a result  we might in the future have to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques  which could leave us exposed to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear 
if we fail to satisfy the or limitations  unless our failure was due to reasonable cause and we meet certain other technical requirements  we could lose our reit status for federal income tax purposes 
even if our failure were due to reasonable cause  we might have to pay a penalty tax equal to the amount of our income in excess of certain thresholds  multiplied by a fraction intended to reflect our profitability 
complying with the reit requirements may force us to borrow to make distributions to our stockholders 
as a reit  we must distribute of our annual taxable income subject to certain adjustments to our stockholders 
from time to time  we might generate taxable income greater than our net income for financial reporting purposes from  among other things  amortization of capitalized purchase premiums  or our taxable income might be greater than our cash flow available for distribution to our stockholders 
if we do not have other funds available in these situations  we might be unable to distribute of our taxable income as required by the reit rules 
in that case  we would need to borrow funds  sell a portion of our mortgage backed securities potentially at disadvantageous prices or find another alternative source of funds 
these alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity and reduce amounts available to invest in mortgage backed securities 
complying with the reit requirements may force us to liquidate otherwise attractive investments 
in order to qualify as a reit  we must ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least of the value of our assets consists of cash  cash items  government securities and qualified reit real estate assets 
the remainder of our investment in securities generally cannot include more than of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer 
in addition  generally  no more than of the value of our assets can consist of the securities of any one issuer 
if we fail to comply with these requirements  we could lose our reit status unless we are able to avail ourselves of certain relief provisions 
under certain relief provisions  we would be subject to penalty taxes 
failure to maintain an exemption from the investment company act would harm our results of operations 
we intend to conduct our business so as not to become regulated as an investment company under the investment company act of  as amended 
if we fail to qualify for this exemption  our ability to use leverage would be substantially reduced and we would be unable to conduct our business as described in this annual report on form k 
the investment company act exempts entities that are primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on  and interests in  real estate 
under the current interpretation of the sec  in order to qualify for this exemption  we must maintain at least of our assets directly in these qualifying real estate interests 
mortgage backed securities that do not represent all of the certificates issued with respect to an underlying pool of mortgages may be treated as separate from the underlying mortgage loans and  thus  may not qualify for purposes of the requirement 
therefore  our ownership of these mortgage backed securities is limited by the provisions of the investment company act 
in satisfying the requirement under the investment company act  we treat as qualifying interests mortgage backed securities issued with respect to an underlying pool as to which we hold all issued 
table of contents certificates 
if the sec adopts a contrary interpretation of such treatment  we could be required to sell a substantial amount of our mortgage backed securities under potentially adverse market conditions 
further  in our attempts to ensure that we at all times qualify for the exemption under the investment company act  we might be precluded from acquiring mortgage backed securities if their yield is higher than the yield on mortgage backed securities that could be purchased in a manner consistent with the exemption 
these factors may lower or eliminate our net income 
misplaced reliance on legal opinions or statements by issuers of mortgage backed securities could result in a failure to comply with reit income or assets tests 
when purchasing mortgage backed securities  we may rely on opinions of counsel for the issuer or sponsor of such securities  or statements made in related offering documents  for purposes of determining whether and to what extent those securities constitute reit real estate assets for purposes of the reit asset tests and produce income that qualifies under the reit gross income tests 
the inaccuracy of any such opinions or statements may adversely affect our reit qualification and result in significant corporate level tax 
one action rules may harm the value of the underlying property 
several states have laws that prohibit more than one action to enforce a mortgage obligation  and some courts have construed the term action broadly 
in such jurisdictions  if the judicial action is not conducted according to law  there may be no other recourse in enforcing a mortgage obligation  thereby decreasing the value of the underlying property 
we may be harmed by changes in various laws and regulations 
changes in the laws or regulations governing seneca may impair seneca s ability to perform services in accordance with the management agreement 
our business may be harmed by changes to the laws and regulations affecting our manager  seneca  or us  including changes to securities laws and changes to the internal revenue code applicable to the taxation of reits 
new legislation may be enacted into law or new interpretations  rulings or regulations could be adopted  any of which could harm us  seneca and our stockholders  potentially with retroactive effect 
legislation was recently enacted that reduces the maximum tax rate of non corporate taxpayers for capital gains for taxable years ending on or after may  and before january  and for dividends for taxable years beginning after december  and before january  to 
generally  dividends paid by reits are not eligible for the new federal income tax rate  with certain exceptions discussed under united states federal income tax considerations taxation of taxable united states stockholders and distributions generally 
although this legislation does not adversely affect the taxation of reits or dividends paid by reits  the more favorable treatment of regular corporate dividends could cause investors who are individuals to consider stocks of other corporations that pay dividends as more attractive relative to stocks of reits 
we may incur excess inclusion income that would increase the tax liability of our stockholders 
in general  dividend income that a tax exempt entity receives from us should not constitute unrelated business taxable income as defined in section of the internal revenue code 
if we realize excess inclusion income and allocate it to our stockholders  this income cannot be offset by net operating losses 
if the stockholder is a tax exempt entity  then this income would be fully taxable as unrelated business taxable income under section of the internal revenue code 
if the stockholder is foreign  it would be subject to us federal income tax withholding on this income without reduction pursuant to any otherwise applicable income tax treaty 
excess inclusion income could result if we held a residual interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit  or remic 
excess inclusion income also would be generated if we were to issue debt obligations with two or more maturities and the terms of the payments on these obligations bore a relationship to the payments 
table of contents that we received on our mortgage backed securities securing those debt obligations 
we generally structure our borrowing arrangements in a manner designed to avoid generating significant amounts of excess inclusion income 
we do  however  enter into various repurchase agreements that have differing maturity dates and afford the lender the right to sell any pledged mortgage securities if we default on our obligations 
the irs may determine that these borrowings give rise to excess inclusion income that should be allocated among our stockholders 
furthermore  some types of tax exempt entities  including voluntary employee benefit associations and entities that have borrowed funds to acquire our common stock  may be required to treat a portion of or all of the distributions they may receive from us as unrelated business taxable income 
finally  we may invest in equity securities of other reits and it is possible that we might receive excess inclusion income from those investments 
risks related to investing in our securities we have not established a minimum distribution payment level  and we cannot assure you of our ability to make distributions to our stockholders in the future 
our policy is to make quarterly distributions to our stockholders in amounts such that we distribute all or substantially all of our taxable income in each year  subject to certain adjustments  which  along with other factors  should enable us to qualify for the tax benefits accorded to a reit under the internal revenue code 
we have not established a minimum distribution payment level and our ability to make distributions might be harmed by the risk factors described in this annual report on form k 
all distributions will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings  our financial condition  maintenance of our reit status and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time 
we cannot assure you that we will have the ability to make distributions to our stockholders in the future 
our declared cash distributions may force us to liquidate mortgage backed securities or borrow additional funds 
from time to time  our board of directors will declare cash distributions 
these distribution declarations are irrevocable 
if we do not have sufficient cash to fund distributions  we will need to liquidate mortgage backed securities or borrow funds by entering into repurchase agreements or otherwise borrowing funds under our margin lending facility to pay the distribution 
if required  the sale of mortgage backed securities at prices lower than the carrying value of such assets would result in losses 
additionally  if we were to borrow funds on a regular basis to make distributions  it is likely that our results of operations and our stock price would be harmed 
future offerings of debt securities by us  which would be senior to our common stock upon liquidation  or equity securities  which would dilute our existing stockholders and may be senior to our common stock for the purposes of distributions  may harm the value of our common stock 
in the future  we may attempt to increase our capital resources by making additional offerings of debt or equity securities  including commercial paper  medium term notes  senior or subordinated notes and classes of preferred stock or common stock 
upon our liquidation  holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock 
additional equity offerings by us may dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders or reduce the value of our common stock  or both 
our preferred stock  if issued  would have a preference on distributions that could limit our ability to make distributions to the holders of our common stock 
because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control  we cannot predict or estimate the amount  timing or nature of our future offerings 
thus  our stockholders bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their stock holdings in us 

table of contents changes in yields may harm the market price of our common stock 
our earnings are derived primarily from the expected positive spread between the yield on our assets and the cost of our borrowings 
this spread will not necessarily be larger in high interest rate environments than in low interest rate environments and may also be negative 
in addition  during periods of high interest rates  our net income and  therefore  the amount of any distributions on our common stock  might be less attractive compared to alternative investments of equal or lower risk 
each of these factors could harm the market price of our common stock 
the market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock may be volatile and be subject to wide fluctuations 
in addition  the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur 
if the market price of our common stock declines significantly  you may be unable to resell your shares at or above your purchase price 
we cannot assure you that the market price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future 
some of the factors that could negatively affect our stock price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results or distributions  changes in our funds from operations or earnings estimates or publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry  increases in market interest rates that lead purchasers of our shares to demand a higher yield  changes in market valuations of similar companies  adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we incur in the future  additions or departures of key management personnel  the termination of or resignation by seneca as our manager  actions by institutional stockholders  speculation in the press or investment community  and general market and economic conditions 
issuance of large amounts of our stock could cause our price to decline 
we may issue additional shares of common stock or shares of preferred stock that are convertible into common stock 
if we were to issue a significant number of shares of our common stock or convertible preferred stock in a short period of time  our outstanding shares of common stock could be diluted and the market price of our common stock could decrease 
restrictions on ownership of a controlling percentage of our capital stock might limit your opportunity to receive a premium on our stock 
for the purpose of preserving our reit qualification and for other reasons  our charter prohibits direct or constructive ownership by any person of more than of the lesser of the total number or value of the outstanding shares of our common stock or more than of the outstanding shares of our preferred stock 
the constructive ownership rules in our charter are complex and may cause our outstanding stock owned by a group of related individuals or entities to be deemed to be constructively owned by one individual or entity 
as a result  the acquisition of less than of our outstanding stock by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity to own constructively in excess of of our outstanding stock  and thus be subject to the ownership limit in our charter 
any attempt to own or transfer shares of our common or preferred stock in excess of the ownership limit without the consent of our board of directors is void  and will result in the shares being transferred by operation of law to a charitable trust 
these provisions might inhibit market activity and the resulting opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares that might otherwise exist 
table of contents if any person were to attempt to assemble a block of our stock in excess of the number of shares permitted under our charter and that may be in the best interests of our stockholders 
broad market fluctuations could harm the market price of our common stock 
the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many companies in industries similar or related to ours and that have been unrelated to these companies operating performances 
these broad market fluctuations could reduce the market price of our common stock 
furthermore  our operating results and prospects may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors or may be lower than those of companies with comparable market capitalizations  which could harm the market price of our common stock 
certain provisions of maryland law and our charter and bylaws could hinder  delay or prevent a change in control of our company 
certain provisions of maryland law  our charter and our bylaws have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing transactions that involve an actual or threatened change in control of our company 
these provisions include the following classified board of directors 
our board of directors is divided into three classes with staggered terms of office of three years each 
the classification and staggered terms of office of our directors make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board of directors 
at least two annual meetings of stockholders  instead of one  generally would be required to effect a change in a majority of our board of directors 
removal of directors 
under our charter  subject to the rights of one or more classes or series of preferred stock to elect one or more directors  a director may be removed only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of at least two thirds of all votes entitled to be cast by our stockholders generally in the election of directors 
number of directors  board vacancies  term of office 
we have elected to be subject to certain provisions of maryland law that vest in our board of directors the exclusive right to determine the number of directors and the exclusive right  by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors  to fill vacancies on the board even if the remaining directors do not constitute a quorum 
these provisions of maryland law  which are applicable even if other provisions of maryland law or our charter or bylaws provide to the contrary  also provide that any director elected to fill a vacancy shall hold office for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors in which the vacancy occurred  rather than the next annual meeting of stockholders as would otherwise be the case  and until his or her successor is elected and qualifies 
limitation on stockholder requested special meetings 
our bylaws provide that our stockholders have the right to call a special meeting only upon the written request of stockholders entitled to cast not less than a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast by our stockholders at such meeting 
advance notice provisions for stockholder nominations and proposals 
our bylaws require advance written notice for stockholders to nominate persons for election as directors at  or to bring other business before  any meeting of our stockholders 
this bylaw provision limits the ability of our stockholders to make nominations of persons for election as directors or to introduce other proposals unless we are notified in a timely manner prior to the meeting 
exclusive authority of our board to amend our bylaws 
our bylaws provide that our board of directors has the exclusive power to adopt  alter or repeal any provision of our bylaws or to make new bylaws 
thus  our stockholders may not effect any changes to our bylaws 
preferred stock 
under our charter  our board of directors has authority to issue preferred stock from time to time in one or more series and to establish the terms  preferences and rights of any such series of preferred stock  all without approval of our stockholders 

table of contents duties of directors with respect to unsolicited takeovers 
maryland law provides protection for maryland corporations against unsolicited takeovers by limiting  among other things  the duties of the directors in unsolicited takeover situations 
the duties of directors of maryland corporations do not require them to accept  recommend or respond to any proposal by a person seeking to acquire control of the corporation  authorize the corporation to redeem any rights under  or modify or render inapplicable  any stockholder rights plan  make a determination under the maryland business combination act or the maryland control share acquisition act  or act or fail to act solely because of the effect the act or failure to act may have on an acquisition or potential acquisition of control of the corporation or the amount or type of consideration that may be offered or paid to the stockholders in an acquisition 
moreover  under maryland law  the act of the directors of a maryland corporation relating to or affecting an acquisition or potential acquisition of control is not subject to any higher duty or greater scrutiny than is applied to any other act of a director 
maryland law also contains a statutory presumption that an act of a director of a maryland corporation satisfies the applicable standards of conduct for directors under maryland law 
ownership limit 
in order to preserve our status as a reit under the internal revenue code  our charter generally prohibits any single stockholder  or any group of affiliated stockholders  from beneficially owning more than of our outstanding common and preferred stock unless our board of directors waives or modifies this ownership limit 
maryland business combination act 
the maryland business combination act provides that  unless exempted  a maryland corporation may not engage in business combinations  including mergers  dispositions of or more of its assets  certain issuances of shares of stock and other specified transactions  with an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder  and thereafter unless specified criteria are met 
an interested stockholder is generally a person owning or controlling  directly or indirectly  or more of the voting power of the outstanding stock of a maryland corporation 
our board of directors has adopted a resolution exempting our company from this statute 
however  our board of directors may repeal or modify this resolution in the future  in which case the provisions of the maryland business combination act would be applicable to business combinations between our company and interested stockholders 
maryland control share acquisition act 
maryland law provides that control shares of a corporation acquired in a control share acquisition shall have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of two thirds of the votes eligible to be cast on the matter under the maryland control share acquisition act 
control shares means shares of stock that  if aggregated with all other shares of stock previously acquired by the acquiror  would entitle the acquiror to exercise voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges of the voting power one tenth or more but less than one third  one third or more but less than a majority or a majority or more of all voting power 
a control share acquisition means the acquisition of control shares  subject to certain exceptions 
if voting rights of control shares acquired in a control share acquisition are not approved at a stockholders meeting  then  subject to certain conditions and limitations  the corporation may redeem any or all of the control shares for fair value 
if voting rights of such control shares are approved at a stockholders meeting and the acquiror becomes entitled to vote a majority of the shares of stock entitled to vote  all other stockholders may exercise appraisal rights 
our bylaws contain a provision exempting acquisitions of our shares from the maryland control share acquisition act 
however  our board of directors may amend our bylaws in the future to repeal or modify this exemption  in which case any control shares of our company acquired in a control share acquisition will be subject to the maryland control share acquisition act 

table of contents the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected by future sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by our existing stockholders in the public market or the availability of such shares for sale 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  of future sales of our common stock  or the availability of shares for future sales  on the market price of our common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock  or the perception that these sales could occur  may harm prevailing market prices for our common stock 
subject to rule volume limitations applicable to our affiliates  substantially all of our  shares of common stock outstanding as of february  are eligible for immediate resale by their holders 
if any of our stockholders were to sell a large number of shares in the public market  the sale could reduce the market price of our common stock and could impede our ability to raise future capital through a sale of additional equity securities 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the market for our common stock  the industry in which we operate and our operations and profitability 
terrorist attacks may harm our results of operations and your investment 
we cannot assure you that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the united states  us businesses or elsewhere in the world 
these attacks or armed conflicts may impact the property underlying our mortgage backed securities  directly or indirectly  by undermining economic conditions in the united states 
losses resulting from terrorist events are generally uninsurable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary component of market risk is interest rate risk  as described below 
while we do not seek to avoid risk completely  we do seek to assume risk that can be quantified from historical experience  to actively manage that risk  to earn sufficient compensation to justify taking those risks and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks we undertake or to which we are exposed 
interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in fixed rate  adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities and our related debt obligations  which are generally repurchase agreements of limited duration that are periodically refinanced at current market rates  and our derivative contracts 
effect on net interest income we fund our investments in some long term  fixed rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities with short term borrowings under repurchase agreements 
during periods of rising interest rates  the borrowing costs associated with those fixed rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities tend to increase while the income earned on such fixed rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities during the fixed rate component of such securities may remain substantially unchanged 
this results in a narrowing of the net interest spread between the related assets and borrowings and may even result in losses 
as a means to mitigate the negative impact of a rising interest rate environment  we have entered into derivative transactions  specifically eurodollar futures contracts and interest rate swaps 
hedging techniques are based  in part  on assumed levels of prepayments of our fixed rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
if prepayments are slower or faster than assumed  the life of the mortgage backed securities will be longer or shorter  which would reduce the effectiveness of any hedging strategies we may utilize and may result in losses on such transactions 
hedging strategies involving the use of derivative securities are highly complex and may produce volatile returns 
our hedging activity will also be limited by the asset and sources of income requirements applicable to us as a reit 

table of contents extension risk we invest in fixed rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities have interest rates that are fixed for the first few years of the loan typically three  five  seven or years and thereafter their interest rates reset periodically on the same basis as adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
as of december   of our investment portfolio was comprised of hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
we compute the projected weighted average life of our fixed rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities based on the market s assumptions regarding the rate at which the borrowers will prepay the underlying mortgages 
in general  when a fixed rate or hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed security is acquired with borrowings  we may  but are not required to  enter into an interest rate swap agreement or other hedging instrument that effectively fixes our borrowing costs for a period close to the anticipated average life of the fixed rate portion of the related mortgage backed security 
this strategy is designed to protect us from rising interest rates because the borrowing costs are fixed for the duration of the fixed rate portion of the related mortgage backed security 
however  if prepayment rates decrease in a rising interest rate environment  the life of the fixed rate portion of the related mortgage backed security could extend beyond the term of the swap agreement or other hedging instrument 
this situation could negatively impact us as borrowing costs would no longer be fixed after the end of the hedging instrument while the income earned on the fixed rate or hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed security would remain fixed 
this situation may also cause the market value of our fixed rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities to decline with little or no offsetting gain from the related hedging transactions 
in extreme situations  we may be forced to sell assets and incur losses to maintain adequate liquidity 
adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed security interest rate cap risk we also invest in adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities  that are based on mortgages that are typically subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps and floors  which limit the amount by which an adjustable rate or hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed security s interest yield may change during any given period 
however  our borrowing costs pursuant to our repurchase agreements will not be subject to similar restrictions 
therefore  in a period of increasing interest rates  interest rate costs on our borrowings could increase without limitation by caps  while the interest rate yields on our adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities would effectively be limited by caps 
this problem will be magnified to the extent we acquire adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities that are not based on mortgages that are fully indexed 
in addition  the underlying mortgages may be subject to periodic payment caps that result in some portion of the interest being deferred and added to the principal outstanding 
the presence of caps could result in our receipt of less cash income on our adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities than we need in order to pay the interest cost on our related borrowings 
these factors could lower our net interest income or cause a net loss during periods of rising interest rates  which would negatively impact our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
interest rate mismatch risk we fund a substantial portion of our acquisitions of adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities with borrowings that have interest rates based on indices and repricing terms similar to  but of somewhat shorter maturities than  the interest rate indices and repricing terms of the mortgage backed securities 
thus  we anticipate that in most cases the interest rate indices and repricing terms of our mortgage assets and our funding sources will not be identical  thereby creating an interest rate mismatch between our mortgage assets and liabilities 
therefore  our cost of funds would likely rise or fall more quickly than would our earnings rate on assets 
during periods of changing interest rates  such interest rate mismatches could negatively impact our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
to mitigate interest rate mismatches  we may utilize hedging strategies discussed above and in note to the financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
our analysis of risks is based on management s experience  estimates  models and assumptions 
these analyses rely on models that utilize estimates of fair value and interest rate sensitivity 
actual economic 
table of contents conditions or implementation of investment decisions by our manager may produce results that differ significantly from our expectations 
prepayment risk prepayments are the full or partial repayment of principal prior to the original term to maturity of a mortgage loan and typically occur due to refinancing of mortgage loans 
prepayment rates for existing mortgage backed securities generally increase when prevailing interest rates fall below the market rate existing when the underlying mortgages were originated 
in addition  prepayment rates on adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities generally increase when the difference between long term and short term interest rates declines or becomes negative 
prepayments of mortgage backed securities could harm our results of operations in several ways 
some adjustable rate mortgages underlying our adjustable rate mortgage backed securities may bear initial teaser interest rates that are lower than their fully indexed rates  which refers to the applicable index rates plus a margin 
in the event that such an adjustable rate mortgage is prepaid prior to or soon after the time of adjustment to a fully indexed rate  the holder of the related mortgage backed security would have held such security while it was less profitable and lost the opportunity to receive interest at the fully indexed rate over the expected life of the adjustable rate mortgage backed security 
although we currently do not own any adjustable rate mortgage backed securities with teaser rates  we may obtain some in the future that would expose us to this prepayment risk 
additionally  we currently own mortgage backed securities that were purchased at a premium 
the prepayment of such mortgage backed securities at a rate faster than anticipated would result in a write off of any remaining capitalized premium amount and a consequent reduction of our net interest income by such amount 
finally  in the event that we are unable to acquire new mortgage backed securities to replace the prepaid mortgage backed securities  our financial condition  cash flow and results of operations could be negatively impacted 
effect on fair value another component of interest rate risk is the effect changes in interest rates will have on the market value of our assets 
we face the risk that the market value of our assets will increase or decrease at different rates than that of our liabilities  including our hedging instruments 
we primarily assess our interest rate risk by estimating the duration of our assets and the duration of our liabilities 
duration essentially measures the market price volatility of financial instruments as interest rates change 
we generally calculate duration using various financial models and empirical data 
different models and methodologies can produce different duration numbers for the same securities 

table of contents the following sensitivity analysis table shows the estimated impact on the fair value of our interest rate sensitive investments and repurchase agreement liabilities  at december   assuming rates instantaneously fall basis points  rise basis points and rise basis points interest rates interest rates interest rates fall rise rise basis points unchanged basis points basis points dollars in millions adjustable rate mortgage backed securities fair value change in fair value change as a percent of fair value hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities fair value change in fair value change as a percent of fair value balloon mortgage backed securities fair value change in fair value change as a percent of fair value total mortgage backed securities fair value change in fair value change as a percent of fair value repurchase agreements fair value change in fair value change as a percent of fair value hedge instruments fair value change in fair value change as a percent of fair value nm nm nm the fair value of the repurchase agreements would not change materially due to the short term nature of these instruments 
nm not meaningful it is important to note that the impact of changing interest rates on fair value can change significantly when interest rates change beyond basis points from current levels 
therefore  the volatility in the fair value of our assets could increase significantly when interest rates change beyond basis points 
in addition  other factors impact the fair value of our interest rate sensitive investments and hedging instruments  such as the shape of the yield curve  market expectations as to future interest rate changes and other market conditions 
accordingly  in the event of changes in actual interest rates  the change in the fair value of our assets would likely differ from that shown above  and such difference might be material and adverse to our stockholders 
risk management to the extent consistent with maintaining our status as a reit  we seek to manage our interest rate risk exposure to protect our portfolio of mortgage backed securities and related debt against the effects of major interest rate changes 
we generally seek to manage our interest rate risk by monitoring and adjusting  if necessary  the reset index and interest rate related to our mortgage backed securities and our borrowings  attempting to structure our borrowing agreements to have a range of different maturities  terms  amortizations and interest rate adjustment periods  using derivatives  financial futures  swaps  options  caps  floors and forward sales to adjust the interest rate sensitivity of our mortgage backed securities and our borrowings  and actively managing  on an aggregate basis  the interest rate indices  interest rate adjustment periods and gross reset margins of our mortgage backed securities and the interest rate indices and adjustment periods of our borrowings
