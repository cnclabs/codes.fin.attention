item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary tredegar is a manufacturer of plastic films and aluminum extrusions 
we also have developed and are marketing an initial line of bone graft substitutes through our therics subsidiary 
descriptions of our businesses are provided on pages in film products  operating profit from ongoing operations was million in compared with million in the decline was primarily due to higher resin costs and the loss of certain domestic backsheet business at the end of the first quarter of see the business segment review beginning on page for more information  partially offset by the positive effects of sales growth for new value added products 
average prices of low density polyethylene resin a primary raw material for film products in the us increased by approximately during the second half of see the chart on page for historical prices since 
resin prices in europe and asia have exhibited similar trends 
we estimate that resin price increases in the fourth quarter resulted in a negative operating profit impact of about million compared with the third quarter of this is in addition to the million adverse impact we estimate occurred between the second and third quarters 
to address fluctuating resin prices  we have pass through or cost sharing agreements covering about of our sales  but many have a day lag 
we are implementing price increases for many customers that are currently not subject to pass through arrangements 
most new customer contracts contain resin pass through arrangements 
however  if resin prices continue to rise at a faster rate than selling prices  the delayed pass through of costs will exert downward pressure on near term profits 
we remain optimistic about the global growth prospects in film products  especially sales of new apertured  elastic  protective and other specialty films 
the chart below shows the growth that we have achieved in these areas during the past year 

pagegif 
we believe much of our sales growth is the result of investments made over the past two years 
aggregate capital expenditures in and totaled million  and we expect to spend another million in  with about million earmarked for a production line that will manufacture a new material that enhances the fit of personal care products 
the new line is already contracted to sca  a billion global personal care market leader headquartered in sweden 
approximately one third of our capital expenditures during and and planned capital expenditures during relate to customer specific opportunities that are covered by capital indemnification  take or pay or similar arrangements 
excluding these opportunities  we estimate that our ongoing capital expenditure requirement in film products is about million annually 
on january   we announced that we are exploring the sale of the films plant in lagrange  georgia 
this plant produces blown films used for adult incontinent and baby diaper backsheet  feminine hygiene pad pouch packaging  and other packaging and industrial applications 
annual revenues for the products that would be included in a sale are about million 
the proposed transaction is not expected to have a material impact on our financial results 
on july   a subsidiary of tredegar purchased the assets of yaheng perforated film material co  ltd 
yaheng for approximately million 
yaheng  based in shanghai  china  has employees and manufactures apertured nonwovens used primarily in personal care markets 
in aluminum extrusions  operating profit from ongoing operations increased to million in volume of million pounds from million in volume of million pounds 
the million or increase in operating profit on volume growth is primarily due to operating leverage and pricing improvements  partially offset by the adverse effects of appreciation of the canadian dollar about million 
based on existing operating levels  we expect future annual operating profits to change at times the percentage change in volume 
volume in was up in most markets after declining by about from the last cyclical peak around volume in our largest market  commercial construction  improved by about in compared with our outlook for continued volume growth in remains favorable 
historically  cyclical upturns in the aluminum extrusions industry last several years with overall cross cycle volume growth in the range 
we believe that our focus on end markets and products that require customization  customer service and quality make us less vulnerable to price competition from low cost suppliers of stock type products  including offshore manufacturers 
our most attractive end markets include residential and non residential windows  curtain walls  louvers vents  agricultural equipment  ladders  walkway covers  pre engineered structures  pleasure boats  custom trailers  and displays 
we continue to focus on reducing costs and aligning our structure to meet the needs of our customers 
three areas that we believe will generate significant savings are the shutdown of the films plant in new bern  north carolina the new bern plant which occurred in the fourth quarter of  the restructuring over the next months of the r d function in film products  and the shutdown of the aluminum extrusions plant in aurora  ontario the aurora plant expected in the first quarter of 
annual cost savings from these moves are expected of about million for the shutdown of the new bern plant  million for the restructuring of the r d function  and million for the shutdown of aurora plant 
related incremental cash expenditures to achieve these savings are about million  million and million  respectively 
more information on film products and aluminum extrusions is provided in the business segment review beginning on page at therics  sales and marketing efforts are evolving more slowly than expected  and we took steps in early january to reduce its expected loss rate from approximately million to million per quarter 
we are exploring potential collaborations with other companies aimed at accelerating market penetration across a broader array of market segments 
we sold our venture capital investment portfolio in the first quarter of for cash proceeds of approximately million  and its activities have been reported as discontinued operations 
the sale generated income taxes recoverable of approximately million  which we received in the first quarter of at december   we had million of available borrowings under our credit facility 
key terms for the facility are summarized in the financial condition review on pages critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial position in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies 
these policies require management to exercise judgments that are often difficult  subjective and complex due to the necessity of estimating the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
impairment and useful lives of long lived identifiable assets and goodwill we regularly assess our long lived identifiable assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from future cash flows 
any necessary impairment charges are recorded when we do not believe the carrying value of the long lived asset will be recoverable 
we also reassess the useful lives of our long lived assets based on changes in our business and technologies 
we assess goodwill for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  or  at a minimum  on an annual basis december of each year 
we have made determinations as to what our reporting units are and what amounts of goodwill and intangible assets should be allocated to those reporting units 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived identifiable assets and goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows  discount rates and other factors to determine if impairment tests are met or the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 
based upon assessments performed  we recorded asset impairment losses for continuing operations related to long lived identifiable assets of million in  million in and million in pension benefits we have noncontributory and contributory defined benefit pension plans that have significant net pension income developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates and plan asset investment returns  in determining these assumptions 
actuarial assumptions may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net pension income recorded in future periods 
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future payments 
in general  our liability increases as the discount rate decreases and vice versa 
we reduced our discount rate in each of the last three years the rate was at the end of  at the end of and at the end of due to the decline in market interest rates 
the compensation increase assumption affects the estimate of future payments  and was at the end of and and at the end of compensation increases were lowered in as a result of expected lower inflation 
a lower expected return on plan assets increases the amount of expense and vice versa 
decreases in the level of actual plan assets will also serve to increase the amount of pension expense 
during and  the value of our plan assets increased due to improved general market conditions after declining in  and last year we decreased our expected long term return on plan assets to and have maintained that rate based on current market and economic conditions and asset mix our expected return was in and in and prior years 
we currently expect net pension income to decline in by approximately million compared to after declining by  in compared to we expect our minimum cash funding requirement to be about  in income taxes many deductions for tax return purposes cannot be taken until the expenses are actually paid  rather than when the expenses are recorded for book purposes 
in these circumstances  we accrue for the tax benefit expected to be received in future years if  in our judgment  it is more likely than not that we will receive such benefits 
in addition  the amount and timing of certain current deductions which reduce taxes currently payable or generate income tax refunds require interpretation of tax laws 
in these circumstances  we estimate and accrue income tax contingencies for differences in interpretation that may exist with tax authorities 
on a quarterly basis  we review our judgments regarding income tax contingency accruals and the likelihood the benefits of a deferred tax asset will be realized 
during the periodic reviews  we must consider a variety of factors  including the nature and amount of the tax income and expense items  the current tax statutes  the current status of audits performed by tax authorities and the projected future earnings 
we believe the realization of our net deferred tax assets is reasonably assured and that our income tax contingency accruals are adequate 
if circumstances change  our valuation allowances for deferred tax assets  income tax contingency accruals and net earnings are adjusted accordingly in that period 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb revised statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 share based payment 
this statement requires that the cost of employee services received in exchange for equity instruments be measured based on the fair value of the award on the grant date 
the statement also requires that the cost be recognized over the employee service period required to receive the award 
the statement applies to awards granted after the effective date and to awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after that date 
the statement is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this standard will have no impact on cash flow 
the primary impact of adoption on tredegar will be the recognition of compensation expense for stock options granted 
currently  we disclose the pro forma effects of treating stock option grants as compensation expense under the fair value based method see pages 
we expect to continue to use the black scholes options pricing model to determine the estimated fair value of option grants but are still evaluating our transition method 
we believe that the pro forma effects that have been disclosed are not materially different from compensation expense that would have been recognized if this standard had been previously adopted 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this statement clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage should be expensed as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during the fiscal years beginning after june  early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this standard will have no impact on cash flow  and we do not expect it to have a significant impact on amounts reported in the consolidated statement of income and balance sheet 
in october  the american jobs creation act of ajca was signed into law 
in december  the fasb issued staff position no 
fsp  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of and staff position no 
fsp  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp clarifies that the manufacturer s tax deduction provided for under the ajca should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with sfas no 
and not as a tax rate reduction 
fsp provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer as provided for in the ajca 
we do not expect that the tax benefits resulting from the ajca will have a material impact on our financial statements

changes in resin prices  and the timing of those changes  could have a significant impact on profit margins in film products 
profit margins in aluminum extrusions are sensitive to fluctuations in aluminum ingot and scrap prices as well as natural gas prices 
there is no assurance of our ability to pass through higher raw material and energy costs to our customers 
we estimate that resin price increases in the fourth quarter resulted in a negative operating profit impact of about million compared with the third quarter of this is in addition to the million adverse impact we estimate occurred between the second and third quarters of the significant increases in the us since in prices of low density polyethylene resin a primary raw material for film products are shown in the chart below

resin prices in europe and asia have exhibited similar trends 
the price of resin is driven by several factors including supply and demand and the price of natural gas  oil and ethylene 
to address fluctuating resin prices  we have pass through or cost sharing agreements covering about of our sales  but many have a day lag 
we are implementing price increases for many customers that are currently not subject to pass through arrangements 
most new customer contracts contain resin pass through arrangements 
however  if resin prices continue to rise at a faster rate than selling prices  the delayed pass through of costs will exert downward pressure on near term profits 
in the normal course of business  we enter into fixed price forward sales contracts with certain customers for the sale of fixed quantities of aluminum extrusions at scheduled intervals 
in order to hedge our exposure to aluminum price volatility see the chart below under these fixed price arrangements  which generally have a duration of not more than months  we enter into a combination of forward purchase commitments and futures contracts to acquire or hedge aluminum  based on the scheduled deliveries 
see note on page for more information

in aluminum extrusions  we hedge from time to time a portion of our exposure to natural gas price volatility by entering into fixed price forward purchase contracts with our natural gas suppliers 
as of december   we had forward contracts with natural gas suppliers covering of our estimated future needs through march   with an average fixed price of per mmbtu 
we estimate that  in an unhedged situation  every per mmbtu per month change in the market price of natural gas has a  impact on the monthly operating profit of aluminum extrusions 
substantially higher prices of natural gas in resulted in a reduction in operating profit in aluminum extrusions of approximately million in compared with

we sell to customers in foreign markets through our foreign operations and through exports from us plants 
the percentage of sales and total assets for manufacturing operations related to foreign markets for and are as follows tredegar corporation manufacturing operations percentage of net sales and total assets related to foreign markets of total net sales total assets foreign oper ations of total net sales total assets foreign oper ations exports from us foreign oper ations exports from us foreign oper ations canada europe latin america asia total exposure to foreign markets the percentages for foreign markets are relative to tredegar s total net sales and total assets from manufacturing operations consolidated net sales and total assets from continuing operations excluding cash and cash equivalents  therics and in  income taxes recoverable from the sale of the venture capital portfolio 
we attempt to match the pricing and cost of our products in the same currency except in canada where about of our sales of aluminum extrusions are us dollar based and generally view the volatility of foreign currencies see the chart below and emerging markets  and the corresponding impact on earnings and cash flow  as part of the overall risk of operating in a global environment 
exports from the us are generally denominated in us dollars 
our foreign currency exposure on income from foreign operations in europe primarily relates to the euro and the hungarian forint 
the relatively high percentage of us dollar priced sales in canada is partly due to the shifting of a large portion of the customers previously served by the aluminum extrusions plant in el campo  texas  in the resulting mismatch between the currency denomination of sales and costs causes lower us dollar translated profits when the canadian dollar appreciates since our costs are higher in us dollar equivalent terms while sales are mostly unaffected the opposite effect occurs when the canadian dollar depreciates in value relative to the us dollar 
we estimate that the appreciation of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar had an adverse impact on operating profit of million in compared with in film products  where we have been able to better match the currency of our sales and costs  we estimate that the appreciation of the euro and hungarian forint relative to the us dollar had a positive impact on operating profit of about million in compared with we are continuing to review the loading of our aluminum extrusions plants in north america to optimize production mix and minimize cost in light of the increase in the us dollar equivalent cost structure of our plants in canada

forward looking and cautionary statements from time to time  we may make statements that may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are based on our then current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those addressed in the forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such a difference include  but are not limited to the following general our future performance is influenced by costs incurred by our operating companies including  for example  the cost of energy and raw materials 
there is no assurance that we will be able to offset fully or on a timely basis the effects of higher raw material costs through price increases 
further  there is no assurance that cost control efforts will be sufficient to offset any additional future declines in revenue or increases in energy  raw material or other costs 
as part of our business strategy  we expect to pursue acquisitions of businesses or investments that we believe have unique and sustainable technologies  products and services in attractive end markets 
the success of this strategy will depend upon our ability to identify  acquire and finance on acceptable terms such businesses and on our ability to manage such businesses and achieve planned synergies and operating results  none of which can be assured 
film products film products is highly dependent on sales associated with one customer  p g 
p g comprised of tredegar s net sales in  in and in the loss or significant reduction of sales associated with p g would have a material adverse effect on our business  as would delays in p g rolling out products utilizing new technologies developed by tredegar 
while we have undertaken efforts to expand our customer base  there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful  or that they will offset any delay or loss of sales and profits associated with p g 
growth of film products depends on our ability to develop and deliver new products at competitive prices  especially in the personal care market 
personal care products are now being made with a variety of new materials  replacing traditional backsheet and other components 
while we have substantial technical resources  there can be no assurance that our new products can be brought to market successfully  or if brought to market successfully  at the same level of profitability and market share of replaced films 
a shift in customer preferences away from our technologies  our inability to develop and deliver new profitable products  or delayed acceptance of our new products in domestic or foreign markets  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
film products operates in a field where our significant customers and competitors have substantial intellectual property portfolios 
the continued success of this business depends on our ability not only to protect our own technologies and trade secrets  but also to develop and sell new products that do not infringe upon existing patents 
although we are not currently involved in any patent litigation  an unfavorable outcome of any such action could have a significant adverse impact on film products 
as film products expands its personal care business  we have greater credit risk that is inherent in broadening our customer base 
aluminum extrusions sales volume and profitability of aluminum extrusions is cyclical and highly dependent on economic conditions of end use markets in the united states and canada  particularly in the construction  distribution and transportation industries 
our market segments are also subject to seasonal slowdowns during the winter months 
from to the second quarter of  profits in aluminum extrusions grew as a result of positive economic conditions in the markets we serve and manufacturing efficiencies 
however  a slowdown in these markets in the second half of resulted in a decline in sales volume and decline in ongoing operating profit compared with the second half of the aluminum extrusions industry continued to be affected by poor economic conditions in and in  our sales volume declined and operating profit declined compared with our sales volume declined and operating profit declined in compared with the decline in ongoing operating profit during these periods at approximately two to three times the rate of the decline in sales volume illustrates the operating leverage inherent in our operations fixed operating costs 
moreover  in higher energy and insurance costs and the appreciation of the canadian dollar against the us dollar had an adverse impact on operating profits 
any benefits associated with cost reductions and productivity improvements may not be sufficient to offset the adverse effects on profitability from pricing and margin pressure and higher bad debts that usually accompany a downturn 
in  operating profit from ongoing operations in aluminum extrusions increased to million from million in the million or increase in operating profit on volume growth is primarily due to operating leverage and pricing improvements 
based on existing operating levels  we expect future annual operating profits to change at times the percentage change in volume 
the markets for our products are highly competitive with product quality  service  delivery performance and price being the principal competitive factors 
aluminum extrusions has over  customers in a variety of end use markets within the broad categories of building and construction  distribution  transportation  machinery and equipment  electrical and consumer durables 
no single customer exceeds of aluminum extrusion s net sales 
due to the diverse customer mix across many end use markets  we believe the industry generally tracks the real growth of the overall economy historical cross cycle volume growth has been in the range 
during improving economic conditions  excess industry capacity is absorbed and pricing pressure becomes less of a factor in many of our end use markets 
conversely  during an economic slowdown  excess industry capacity often drives increased pricing pressure in many end use markets as competitors protect their position with key customers 
because the business is susceptible to these changing economic conditions  aluminum extrusions targets complex  customized  service intensive business with more challenging requirements which is competitively more defensible compared to higher volume  standard extrusion applications 
foreign imports  primarily from china  currently represent less than of the north american aluminum extrusion market 
foreign competition to date has been primarily large volume  standard extrusion profiles that impact some of our less strategic end use markets 
market share erosion in other end use markets remains possible 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain current margins and profitability 
our continued success and prospects depend on our ability to retain existing customers and participate in overall industry cross cycle growth 
therics therics has incurred losses since inception  and we are unsure when  or if  it will become profitable 
we are in the initial stages of commercializing certain orthobiologic products that have received fda clearances 
there can be no assurance that any of these products can be brought to market successfully 
the commercialization of new future products will require significant research  development  preclinical and clinical testing  and regulatory approvals 
where potential new products do not advance beyond early product development or do not demonstrate preclinical or clinical efficacy  they will not likely be commercialized 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the fda and other regulatory authorities will clear our products in a timely manner 
our ability to develop and commercialize products will depend on our ability to internally develop preclinical  clinical  regulatory  manufacturing and sales  distribution and marketing capabilities  or enter into arrangements with third parties to provide those functions 
we may not be successful in developing these capabilities or entering into agreements with third parties on favorable terms 
to the extent we rely on third parties for these capabilities  our control over such activities may be reduced which could make us dependent upon these parties 
the inability to develop or contract for these capabilities would significantly impair our ability to develop and commercialize products and thus our ability to become profitable 
related factors that may impair our ability to develop and commercialize products include our reliance on pre clinical and clinical data concerning our products and product introductions by competing companies 
likewise  in the event we are unable to manufacture our products efficiently or demonstrate to the relevant markets the value of our products or their advantages over competitive products  our ability to commercialize products and thus our operating results will be negatively affected 
sales and marketing efforts are evolving more slowly than expected 
we have been relying to a significant degree on a sales force consisting of independent sales agents for the sale and marketing of our products 
market acceptance of our products  and thus our ability to become profitable  is largely dependent upon the competency of this sales force  whether they perform their duties in line with our expectations and their continued willingness to carry our products 
we are exploring potential collaborations with other companies aimed at accelerating market penetration across a broader array of market segments  but we may not be able to enter into any such collaboration nor may such collaboration be successful even if we enter into one 
our ability to develop and commercialize products will depend on market acceptance of those products 
we are dependent upon the willingness of the medical community to learn about and try our products and then switch from currently used products to our products 
in the event the community is reluctant or unwilling to utilize our products  our ability to generate profits will be significantly impaired 
commercial success is also dependent upon third party payor acceptance of our products 
our ability to develop and commercialize certain products is dependent upon sufficient sources of supply for various raw materials 
we may not be successful in procuring the types and quantities of raw materials necessary to commercialize certain orthobiologic products  which would significantly impair our ability to become profitable 
future sales and profits are dependent upon obtaining and maintaining all necessary regulatory approvals 
we have received clearances from the fda for certain products as medical devices  which approvals must be maintained in order to commercialize these products 
similar fda approval will need to be obtained for any new products in order to market those products 
in addition  depending upon where we intend to engage in marketing activities  we may need to obtain the necessary approvals from the regulatory agencies of the applicable jurisdictions 
moreover  our manufacturing practices are regulated and periodically reviewed by the fda 
failure to obtain and maintain the necessary regulatory approvals would significantly impair our ability to market our products and thus our ability to generate profits 
likewise  the marketing of our products and our profit generating capability would be impaired in the event approval of one or more of our products is limited or restricted by the fda  either in conjunction with or subsequent to approval 
we are highly dependent on several principal members of our management and scientific staff 
the loss of key personnel or the inability to recruit key personnel could have a material adverse effect on therics business and results of operations  and could inhibit product research and development  commercialization and sales and marketing efforts 
failure to retain and recruit executive management in key areas  including sales and marketing and product research and development  could prevent us from achieving our business objectives 
we are dependent upon certain license rights  patents and other proprietary rights 
future success is dependent in part on our ability to maintain and enforce license  patent and other proprietary rights 
complex legal and technical issues define the strength and value of our intellectual property portfolio 
while we own or license certain patents  the issuance of a patent does not establish conclusively either validity or enforceability 
the patent positions of biotechnology firms generally are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions that can determine who has the right to develop a particular product 
no clear policy has emerged regarding the breadth of claims covered by biotechnology patents in the us the biotechnology patent situation outside the us is even more uncertain and is currently undergoing review and revision in many countries 
changes in  or different interpretations of  patent laws in the us and other countries might allow others to use our discoveries or to develop and commercialize our products without any compensation to us 
our business exposes us to potential product liability claims 
the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sale of our products subject us to product liability risk  an inherent risk for our industry 
a successful product liability action against us may have a material adverse effect on our business 
moreover  present insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover potential future product liability claims

domestic backsheet net sales excluding volume shortfall payments were approximately million in and million in we lost share in domestic backsheet as the market transitioned from products made from film to products made from laminates of film and nonwovens 
we did not anticipate this market change and fell behind on the technology curve 
once initial business was lost  economies of scale began to increasingly favor the competition resulting in additional lost business 
we have made a number of changes in response to losing this business  including increasing our marketing resources  conducting our own consumer research and selling to the broader marketplace 
we also are continuously focused on reducing the cost of our products in light of competitive pricing pressures 
while we continue to sell backsheet products on a global basis  our primary prospects for growth relate to apertured films and nonwoven materials used as topsheets in feminine hygiene products for example  our new apertured topsheet product for p g s sanitary napkin business  elastic materials used in baby diapers for example  our elastic fastening components improve overall comfort and fit  materials used in adult incontinent products for example  our elastic materials and transfer layers meet the growing need for adult incontinent products that improve the lifestyles of an aging population  films used for surface protection for example  our protective film is used to protect automobiles and flat panel display components such as glass during fabrication  shipping and handling  films used for packaging for example  our thin gauge high density polyethylene film used as overwrap for tissue and towel products provides customers with cost savings and is readily printable and convertible on conventional processing equipment  and continued global expansion efforts 
excluding domestic backsheet sales  net sales in film products grew at a compounded annual growth rate of approximately from on a volume basis
