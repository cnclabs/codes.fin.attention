additionally  movietickets 
com launched in the united kingdom in july of employees at march   hollywood media employed approximately full time employees 
of our employees  employees are engaged in our data syndication and licensing business divisions conducted through the source business and baseline studiosystems  employees are engaged in our broadway ticketing division  employees are engaged in the development  production and selling and marketing of hollywood 
com and our other websites  employees are engaged in our intellectual properties division  employees are engaged in our cable tv business  and are corporate  technology and administrative employees 
none of the employees are represented by a labor union  nor have we experienced any work stoppages 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
risks of investing in our shares investments in our capital stock are speculative and involve a high degree of risk 
investors should carefully consider the following matters  as well as the other information in this form k 
if any of these risks or uncertainties actually occur  our business  results of operations  financial condition  or prospects could be substantially harmed  which would adversely affect your investment 
we have a history of losses and an accumulated deficit 
our operating results could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis 
we have incurred significant losses since we began doing business 
in the years ended december  and we had net losses of approximately million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we may incur additional losses while we continue to grow our businesses 
our future success will depend on the continued growth in our various businesses  and our ability to generate ticketing  licensing  syndication and advertising revenues 
in addition  our operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  including o seasonal variations in the demand for broadway tickets and resulting variations in our revenue from broadway ticket sales  o our ability to sell advertisements to be displayed on our websites and on our cable tv networks  o seasonal trends in internet usage and internet sales and advertising placements  o our ability to enter into or renew strategic relationships and agreements with media organizations  websites and authors  o the amount and timing of our marketing expenditures and other costs relating to the expansion of our operations  o new products  websites or internet services introduced by us or our competitors  and o technical difficulties  security concerns or system downtime affecting the internet generally or the operation of our websites in particular 
as a result  our operating results for any particular period may not accurately predict our future operating results 
we may not able to compete successfully 
ticketing businesses 
the market for ticketing services and products is intensely competitive and rapidly changing 
the number of telephone services  online services  wireless services and websites competing for consumers attention and spending has proliferated and we expect that competition will continue to intensify 
we compete  directly and indirectly  for customers  advertisers  members and content providers with the following categories of companies o telephone services  wireless services and websites targeted to entertainment enthusiasts  moviegoers  theatergoers and other eventgoers  which feature directories of movies  shows  events  showtimes  theater and event locations and related content  and also allow users to purchase tickets  o travel agents and other traditional ticketing organizations  companies  agents and brokers  and o the box office at each of the venues that hold events for which we sell tickets 
internet businesses 
the market for internet services and products is intensely competitive and rapidly changing 
competition could result in reduced traffic to our websites  price reductions for content that we syndicate and advertising that we offer  a decline in product sales  reduced margins or loss of market share  any of which could cause a material decrease in our revenues 
we compete  directly and indirectly  for advertisers  viewers  members and content providers with the following categories of companies o online services or websites targeted to entertainment enthusiasts  particularly moviegoers and theatergoers  such as imdb 
com  o publishers and distributors of traditional off line media  such as television  radio and print  including those targeted to movie enthusiasts  many of which have established or may establish websites  such as e online 
com  o traditional movie and entertainment organizations including the walt disney company and warner bros  o general purpose consumer online services such as aol  yahoo  and msn  each of which provides access to movie related information and services  and o web search and retrieval and other online services  such as google  yahoo and other high traffic websites 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in attracting and retaining users are the depth  breadth and timeliness of content  the ability to offer compelling and entertaining content and brand recognition 
other important factors in attracting and retaining users include ease of use  service quality and cost 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in attracting and retaining advertisers include the number of users of our website  the demographics of our users  price and the creative implementation of advertisement placements and sponsorship promotions 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete favorably with respect to these factors 
based on our review of publicly available documents  we believe some of our existing competitors in both our ticketing and internet businesses  as well as potential new competitors  have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources  greater name recognition and substantially larger user bases than we do and  therefore  have significantly greater ability to attract advertisers and users 
in addition  many of these competitors may be able to respond more quickly than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in internet user requirements and to devote greater resources than us to the development  promotion and sale of their services 
there can be no assurance that our current or potential competitors will not develop products and services comparable or superior to those developed by us or adapt more quickly than us to new technologies  evolving industry trends or changing internet user preferences 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share  any of which would result in a decrease in our revenues 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  or that competitive pressures faced by us would not impair our ability to expand our operations or grow our revenues 
intellectual properties and book development and licensing businesses 
numerous companies and individuals are engaged in the book development business 
we also compete with a large number of companies that license characters and properties into film  television  books and merchandise 
competition in these businesses is largely based on the number and quality of relationships that we are able to develop with authors and celebrities 
there can be no assurance that our current or future competitors will not be successful in developing relationships with authors and celebrities with whom we have previously had relationships 
our revenues will decrease if we are unable to maintain these relationships or develop new relationships 
we may not be able to successfully protect our trademarks and proprietary rights 
internet businesses 
our performance and ability to compete are dependent to a significant degree on our internally developed and licensed content and technology 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our employees and with third parties and contractual provisions to establish and maintain our proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate  or that third parties will not infringe upon or misappropriate our copyrights  trademarks  service marks and similar proprietary rights 
in addition  effective copyright and trademark protection may be unenforceable or limited in certain foreign countries 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce and protect our trademarks  service marks  trade secrets  copyrights and other intellectual property rights 
any such litigation would be costly and could divert management s attention from other more productive activities 
adverse determinations in such litigation could result in the loss of certain of our proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities  require us to seek licenses from third parties  or prevent us from selling our services 
we own trademark registrations in the united states for many of the trademarks that we use  including hollywood 
com and broadway 
com  and some of our trademarks are registered in select foreign countries 
we have also filed trademark applications in select foreign countries for the marks hollywood media corp  hollywood 
com  and others 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure adequate protection for these names or other trademarks in the united states or in foreign countries 
if we obtain registration of those trademarks  we may not be able to prevent our competitors from using different trademarks that contain the words hollywood or broadway 
many countries have a first to file trademark registration system  and thus we may be prevented from registering our marks in certain countries if third parties have previously filed applications to register or have registered the same or similar marks 
it is possible that our competitors or others will adopt product or service names similar to ours  thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to customer confusion 
our inability to protect our hollywood 
com and broadway 
com marks and other marks adequately could impair our ability to maintain and expand such brands and thus impair our ability to generate revenue from these brands 
intellectual properties business 
hollywood media has applied for trademark and copyright protection for each of its major intellectual property titles 
hollywood media currently has approximately us registered trademarks and ten pending trademark applications in the us related to this business  and netco partners currently has six us registered trademarks and three pending trademark applications in the us in addition  hollywood media currently has approximately foreign registered trademarks and pending trademark applications in several foreign jurisdictions  and netco partners currently has one registered trademark in the european union 
as hollywood media s properties are developed  hollywood media intends to apply for further trademark and copyright protection in the united states and certain foreign countries 
copyright protection in the united states on new publications of works for hire extend for a term of years from the date of initial publication or years from the year of creation  whichever expires first 
trademark registration in the united states extends for a period of ten years following the date of registration 
to maintain the registration  affidavits must be filed between the fifth and sixth years following the registration date affirming that the trademark is still in use in commerce and providing evidence of such use 
the trademark registration must be renewed prior to the expiration of the ten year period following the date of registration 
we may become subject to liability for infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not bring copyright or trademark infringement claims against us  or claim that our use of certain technology violates a patent 
even if these claims are not meritorious  they could be costly and could divert management s attention from other more productive activities 
if it is determined that we have infringed upon or misappropriated a third party s proprietary rights  there can be no assurance that any necessary licenses or rights could be obtained on terms satisfactory to us  if at all 
the inability to obtain any required license on satisfactory terms could force us to incur expenses to change the way we operate our businesses 
if our competitors prepare and file applications that claim trademarks owned or registered by us  we may oppose these applications and have to participate in administrative proceedings to determine priority of right in the trademark  which could result in substantial costs to us  even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us 
an adverse outcome could require us to license disputed rights from third parties or to cease using such trademarks 
in addition  inasmuch as we license a portion of our content from third parties  our exposure to copyright infringement or right of privacy or publicity actions may increase  because we must rely upon such third parties for information as to the origin and ownership of such licensed content 
we generally obtain representations as to the origins  ownership and right to use such licensed content and generally obtain indemnification to cover any breach of any such representations  however  there can be no assurance that such representations will be accurate or that such indemnification will provide adequate compensation for any breach of such representation 
there can be no assurance that the outcome of any litigation between such licensors and a third party or between us and a third party will not lead to royalty obligations for which we are not indemnified or for which such indemnification is insufficient  or that we will be able to obtain any additional license on commercially reasonable terms if at all 
we must manage our growth in order to achieve the desired results 
we have significantly expanded our data syndication  internet and ticketing operations over the past six years through our acquisitions of the businesses of hollywood 
com  inc  cinemasource  inc  baseline  inc  broadwaytheater 
com  inc  theatre direct ny  inc  filmtracker and studio systems  inc  and through the launch of broadway 
com and movietickets 
com hollywood media currently owns of the equity of movietickets 
com  inc 
we plan to continue to expand our operations and market presence by entering into joint ventures  acquisitions  business combinations  investments  or other strategic alliances 
these transactions create risks such as o problems retaining key technical and managerial personnel  o the availability of financing to make acquisitions  o additional expenses of acquired businesses  and o the inability to maintain relationships with the customers or other business partners of acquired businesses 
we may not succeed in addressing these risks if we are not able to adequately develop or increase our management  operational and financial resources and systems 
to the extent that we are unable to identify and successfully integrate future ventures into our operations  our growth strategy may not be successful and our stock price could decrease 
we are dependent on our ability to develop strategic relationships with media  entertainment and internet organizations 
the success of our operations is dependent in part on our ability to enter into and maintain strategic relationships and agreements with media  entertainment and internet organizations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and maintain these strategic relationships and  if we are unable to do so  our financial conditions and results of operations could be adversely impacted 
in addition  our intellectual property division is dependent on our ability to identify  attract and retain best selling authors and media celebrities who create our intellectual properties 
our ability to enter into contracts with new authors or renew contracts would be impaired without the services of dr 
martin greenberg 
see the risk factor our ability to attract qualified personnel and retain certain key personnel is critical to our business below 
our operations could be negatively impacted by systems interruptions 
the hardware and software used in our internet and ticketing operations  or that of our affiliates  could be damaged by fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events 
our websites could also be affected by computer viruses  electronic break ins or other similar disruptive problems 
these system problems could affect our business 
insurance may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to any failures or interruptions in systems 
general internet traffic interruptions or delays could also harm our business 
as with internet websites in general  our websites may experience slower response times or decreased traffic for a variety of reasons 
additionally  online service providers have experienced significant outages in the past  and could experience outages  delays and other difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems 
to the extent our services are disrupted  we could lose users of our websites and our ticketing and advertising revenues could decline 
we are subject to additional security risks by doing business over the internet 
a significant obstacle to consumer acceptance of electronic commerce over the internet has been the need for secure transmission of confidential information in transaction processing 
internet usage could decline if any well publicized compromise of security occurred 
we may incur additional costs to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches 
if a third person were able to misappropriate our users personal information or credit card information  we could be held liable for failure to adequately protect such information and subject to monetary damages to the extent our users suffer financial losses or other harm as a result thereof 
we may not be able to adapt as technologies and customer expectations continue to evolve 
to be successful  we must adapt to rapidly changing technologies by continually enhancing our websites and ticketing services and introducing new services to address our customers changing expectations 
we must evaluate and implement new technologies that are available in the marketplace or risk that our customers will not continue using our services 
examples of technologies that we continue to implement or evaluate include those related to streaming and downloading of audio and video content on our websites  delivery of content over wireless devices and the convergence of cable television  satellite and internet services and delivery systems 
we could incur substantial costs if we need to modify our services or infrastructure in order to adapt to changes affecting providers of content and services through the internet 
our customer base and thus our revenues could decrease if we cannot adapt to these changes 
government regulation of the internet could impact our business 
the application of existing laws and regulations to our business relating to issues such as user privacy  pricing  taxation  content  sweepstakes  copyrights  trademarks  advertising  and the characteristics and quality of our products and services can be unclear 
we also may be subject to new laws and regulations related to our business 
although we endeavor to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and believe that we are in compliance  because of the uncertainty of existing laws and the possibility that new laws may be adopted  there is a risk that we will not be in full compliance 
several federal laws could have an impact on our business 
the digital millennium copyright act establishes binding rules that clarify and strengthen protection for copyrighted works in digital form  including works used via the internet and other computer networks 
the child online protection act is intended to restrict the distribution of certain materials deemed harmful to children 
the children s online privacy protection act of protects the privacy of children using the internet  by requiring  among other things  that in certain specific instances the operator of a website must obtain parental consent before collecting  using or disclosing personal information from children under the age of  the operator of a website to make certain disclosures and notices on the website or online service regarding the collection  use or disclosure of such personal information  and the operator of a website or online service to establish and maintain reasonable procedures to protect the confidentiality  security and integrity of personal information collected from children under the age of our efforts to comply with these and other laws subject our business to additional costs  and failure to comply could expose our business to liability 
we are dependent on mitchell rubenstein and laurie s 
silvers  our founders 
mitchell rubenstein  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  and laurie s 
silvers  our vice chairman  president and secretary  have been primarily responsible for our organization and development 
the loss of the services of either of these individuals would hurt our business 
if either of these individuals were to leave hollywood media unexpectedly  we could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors and could experience a loss in productivity while any successor obtains the necessary training and experience 
the employment agreements between hollywood media and each of these individuals provide  among other things  that if we terminate either of their agreements without cause  we will have also terminated the other s agreement without cause 
our ability to attract qualified personnel and retain certain key personnel is critical to our business 
our future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of our executive officers and key personnel 
our future operating results will also depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management  technical  marketing  sales and support personnel 
competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense  and we cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel 
in addition  there may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of our key employees  by the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position  or by our inability to attract and retain skilled employees 
our intellectual property business could be harmed by the loss of the services of dr 
martin h 
greenberg  who has been primarily responsible for developing relationships with the best selling authors who create our intellectual properties 
dr 
greenberg owns the remaining interest in tekno books through which we operate our intellectual properties division 
many of the authors with whom we have relationships are bound to multiple book contracts and our ability to renew these contracts or enter into contracts with new authors would be impaired without the services of dr 
greenberg 
we may be liable for the content we make available on the internet 
there is risk that we could become subject to various types of legal claims relating to the content we make available on our websites or the downloading and distribution of such content  or the content we license for books  including claims such as defamation  invasion of privacy and copyright infringement 
although we carry liability insurance that covers some types of claims to a limited extent  our insurance may not cover all potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to cover all costs incurred in defense of potential claims or to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
any costs or imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have authorized but unissued preferred stock  which could affect rights of holders of common stock 
our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of preferred stock with designations  rights and preferences determined from time to time by our board of directors 
accordingly  our board of directors is empowered  without shareholder approval  to issue preferred stock with dividends  liquidation  conversion  voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of common stock 
in addition  the preferred stock could be issued as a method of discouraging a takeover attempt 
although we do not intend to issue any preferred stock at this time  we may do so in the future 
our articles of incorporation  shareholders rights plan and florida law may discourage takeover attempts 
certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and our shareholders rights plan may discourage takeover attempts and may make it more difficult to change or remove management 
our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock with designations  rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors 
under our shareholder s rights plan adopted in  our board of directors declared a dividend of one right for each share of common stock 
if certain events  such as a takeover bid not approved by our board  occur  the rights will then entitle most holders to purchase at a specified price  shares of a series of our preferred stock with special voting  dividend and other rights 
in addition  florida has enacted legislation that may deter or frustrate takeovers of florida corporations  such as our company 
the florida control share acquisitions statute provides that shares acquired in a control share acquisition which excludes transactions approved by our board of directors will not have voting rights unless the voting rights are approved by a majority of the corporation s disinterested shareholders 
a control share acquisition is an acquisition  in whatever form  of voting power in any of the following ranges a at least but less than of all voting power  b at least but less than a majority of all voting power  or c a majority or more of all voting power 
the state of florida affiliated transactions statute requires approval by disinterested directors or supermajority approval by disinterested shareholders of certain specified transactions between a public corporation and holders of more than of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation or their affiliates 
our stock price is volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly 
during the months ended december   the trading price for our common stock on the nasdaq stock market ranged from to per share 
our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors  such as our quarterly operating results  announcements of new products or services  announcements of mergers  acquisitions  strategic alliances  or divestitures and other factors  including similar announcements by other companies that investors may consider to be comparable to us 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market prices for internet related companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of the companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may cause the market price of our stock to decrease  regardless of our operating performance 
future sales of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect our stock price and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings 
future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that these sales could occur  could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity securities 
we may issue additional shares of common stock in connection with future financings  acquisitions or other transactions  or pursuant to outstanding stock options  warrants and other convertible securities  and we plan to issue additional stock options from time to time to our employees and directors 
we are generally unable to estimate or predict the amount  timing or nature of future issuances or public sales of our common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could cause the market price for our common stock to decrease 
in addition  a decline in the price of our common stock would likely impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of common stock or other equity securities 
we may require additional capital to finance our growth or operations and there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on favorable terms 
we have required substantial financing to fund our acquisitions  growth and operations since our inception  and we may require additional financing in the future 
our long term financial success depends on our ability to generate sufficient revenue and cash flow to offset operating expenses 
to the extent we do not generate sufficient revenues and cash flow to offset expenses we will require further financing to fund our ongoing operations 
we cannot assure you that any additional financing will be available or if available  that it will be on favorable terms 
the terms of any financing that we enter into will vary depending on many factors including  among other things  our then current financial condition  the market price of our common stock  and other characteristics and terms of our capital structure including outstanding options and warrants 
we may seek to raise additional capital through public or private offerings of equity securities or debt financings 
our issuance of additional equity securities could cause dilution to holders of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the incurrence of additional debt could increase our interest expense and other debt service obligations and could result in the imposition of covenants that restrict our operational and financial flexibility 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of has required changes in some of our corporate governance and securities disclosure or compliance practices 
the sarbanes oxley act also required the securities and exchange commission to promulgate new rules on a variety of subjects  in addition to rule proposals already made  and nasdaq has revised and continues to revise its requirements for companies that are nasdaq listed 
these developments have increased our legal compliance and financial reporting costs 
these developments could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  or qualified executive officers 
we are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result 
we are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under section of the sarbanes oxley act of and any adverse results from such evaluation  or a failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls  could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
we are in the process of documenting and testing our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act  which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm addressing these assessments 
we have identified certain material weaknesses in internal controls as described in item a controls and procedures and  during the course of our testing  we may identify additional control deficiencies which we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the deadline imposed by the sarbanes oxley act for compliance with the requirements of section in addition  if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  as such standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 
while we currently anticipate being able to satisfy the requirements of section on or before may   we cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation  testing and any required remediation 
if we are not able to complete our assessment under section on or before may   we and our independent registered public accounting firm would be unable to issue the required reports on internal control over financial reporting as of december  other economic factors may adversely affect our future results or the market price of our stock including recession  war or terrorism 
we operate in a rapidly changing economic and technological environment that presents numerous risks 
many of these risks are beyond our control and are driven by factors that we cannot predict 
economic recession  war  terrorism  international incidents  labor strikes and disputes  and other negative economic conditions may cause damage or disruption to our facilities  information systems  vendors  employees  customers and or website traffic  which could adversely impact our revenues and results of operations  and stock price

therefore  the payment of any cash dividends on the common stock is unlikely in the foreseeable future

following the closure of our retail stores by the end of and expansion of our business through acquisitions  we currently rely on our broadway ticketing operations  data business syndication operations and internet advertising sales along with our existing intellectual properties business to generate revenues for the foreseeable future 
the growth of our businesses  including broadway ticketing data syndication and internet ad sales operations has required substantial financing and may require additional financing to fund our growth plan and for working capital 
our operating plans and assumptions indicate that anticipated cash flows  when combined with other potential sources of capital  including the million commitment by our chief executive officer and our president to provide funding as described below  will be sufficient to meet our operating  liquidity and or working capital requirements through the twelve month period ending december  if our plans change or our assumptions prove to be inaccurate  we may need to seek further financing or reduce the scope of our operations

we continue to focus our resources on the expansion of our data business  broadway ticketing  internet ad sales and intellectual properties units 
broadway ticketing has become the most significant revenue source for hollywood media  most notably through the launch of broadway 
com in may and broadway in november in january  we merged baseline with filmtracker providing a combined service incorporating baseline s rich data with filmtracker s content management system and in july acquired studio systems  inc  a leading entertainment industry database and information service provider 
expansion of our data business is equally as important since we have stabilized the costs to run these operations and we expect that the high gross margins generated from these business units will improve overall cash flow 
while hollywood media believes that the acquisitions made during through together with the continuing consolidation of resources and development of our businesses will lead hollywood media to net income in the future  there can be no assurances that the revenues generated will be sufficient to generate material net positive cash flow or net income

the investors included mitchell rubenstein  the chairman of the board and chief executive officer  and laurie s 
silvers  the vice chairman and president  of hollywood media  and they participated in this financing with a  cash investment upon the same terms as the other investors 
the investors also received fully vested warrants the warrants to acquire at any time through may  an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
as a result of the above referenced private placement of common stock in february  the per share conversion price of the debentures was reduced to per share  and the exercise price of the warrants was reduced to per share  after giving effect to the weighted average anti dilution provisions of the debentures and warrants 
the debentures and warrants contain customary anti dilution provisions as more fully described in the agreements 
during august and september of  million principal amount of the debentures was converted into shares of hollywood media s common stock at a conversion price of per share  including the  principal amount of debentures held by hollywood media s chief executive officer and president 
prior to such conversions  the prevailing conversion price of the converted debentures had been reduced from per share to per share pursuant to hollywood media s negotiations and agreements with the converting investors for the purpose of facilitating such conversions prior to maturity 
following such conversions  the remaining debenture still outstanding  principal amount was amended to extend the maturity date to may  and to remove restrictive covenants  and the conversion price of this debenture was reduced from per share to per share

the growth of our businesses  including our data syndication  ticketing and internet ad sales operations has required substantial financing and may require additional financing to fund our growth plans and for working capital 
based on our plans and assumptions for operations and investment and financing activities during  we estimate that our cash and cash equivalents on hand  anticipated cash flow from operations  and potential amounts available if we undertake further equity or debt financing  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and investment requirements through the end of the twelve month period ending december  if our plans change or our assumptions prove to be inaccurate  we may need to seek further financing or curtail our growth and or operations 
we believe that our long term financial success ultimately depends on our ability to generate enough revenue to offset operating expenses 
to the extent we do not generate sufficient revenues to offset expenses we will require further financing to fund our ongoing operations

these anticipated capital expenditures do not include any estimates for business acquisitions 
during we incurred costs in connection with preparations for compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  including million for consulting expertise  and million of increased audit expenses for the section review 
at this time we are unable to accurately estimate the full amount of the costs that hollywood media will incur during in connection with our ongoing section compliance efforts  however  such costs during are currently anticipated to include  in addition to the new information systems referenced above  an additional million for consulting expertise and million for the section audit expenses 
additional costs may be incurred during in connection with section compliance preparations but have not been quantified at this time

certain leases provide for payment of real estate taxes  common area maintenance  insurance  and certain other expenses 
lease terms expire at various dates through the year also  certain equipment used in hollywood media s operations is leased under operating leases 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which were established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes of the sort contemplated by paragraph of item of sec regulation s k 
as such  management believes that we currently do not have any disclosures to make of the sort contemplated by paragraph of item regarding off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies in response to the sec s release number cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies and sec release number  commission statement about management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we will evaluate our estimates  including those related to asset impairment  accruals for compensation and related benefits  revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  and contingencies and litigation 
these estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
for a summary of all our significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies discussed below  see note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company s accounting for doubtful accounts contains uncertainty because management must use judgment to assess the collectibility of these accounts 
when preparing these estimates  management considers a number of factors  including the aging of a customer s account  past transactions with customers  creditworthiness of specific customers  historical trends and other information 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  at december  and december   respectively 
although the company believes its allowance is sufficient  if the financial condition of the company s customers were to unexpectedly deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required that could materially impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of customers comprising the company s customer base and their dispersion across many different geographical regions 
ticketing revenue recognition ticketing revenue is derived from the sale of live theater tickets for broadway  off broadway and london shows to individuals  groups  travel agencies  tour groups and educational facilities 
revenue recognition is deferred on ticket sales until performance has taken place 
ticketing revenue and cost of revenue are recorded on a gross basis 
in august  the fasb emerging issue task force issued eitf issue no 
 accounting by a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor eitf  which addresses the accounting by a vendor for consideration given to a customer  including both a reseller of the vendor s products and a entity that purchases the vendor s products from a reseller 
hollywood media adopted early eitf issue no 
on december  for its ticketing business 
the impact on reported results of operations on was a reduction in net revenues and a corresponding decrease in cost of revenue ticketing by  resulting in no change in financial position 
advertising costs hollywood media expenses the cost of advertising as incurred or when such advertising initially takes place 
during  hollywood media issued common stock and warrants to cbs with a fair value of approximately million in exchange for approximately million of advertising on cbs properties to be received over a period of seven years 
hollywood media was entitled to utilize a specified portion of this advertising each contract year 
the deferred advertising was carried on hollywood media s balance sheet as a deferred asset and was being amortized over the contract period as the advertising is utilized 
advertising expense recorded related to cbs advertising for  and was   and  respectively  and is separately reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations under the caption amortization of cbs advertising 
on august   hollywood media entered into an exchange agreement with viacom which terminated various agreements with cbs 
refer to amortization of cbs advertising and impairment loss relating to cbs advertising above 
self insurance reserves hollywood media maintains self insured retentions for its health benefits programs and limits its exposure by maintaining stop loss and aggregate liability coverage 
the estimate of the company s self insurance liability contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate the ultimate cost that will be incurred to settle reported claims and unreported claims for incidents incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date 
when estimating the company s self insurance liability  management considers a number of factors  which include historical claim experience 
the self insurance program was initiated in june management recorded the maximum amount of potential liability under the stop loss coverage due to the lack of historical claims experience data available 
in the future  management will consult third party actuaries to assist in management s estimate 
stock based compensation as permitted under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transaction and disclosure an amendment of fas sfas no 
 which amended statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 we have chosen to account for our stock plan under the intrinsic value method as allowed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
and related interpretations 
under apb no 
 because the exercise price of our employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recorded except as discussed in note supplemental disclosure of noncash investing and financial activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
sfas no 
requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of our employee stock options granted and pro forma financial information assuming compensation expense was recorded using these fair values 
determining the fair value of stock option requires the company to make assumptions regarding the key variables of a stock option pricing model which includes expected volativity  estimated life and dividend yield 
these estimates are sensitive to changes in several factors including market conditions 
impairment of long lived assets effective december   hollywood media adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

sfas no 
superseded sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas no 
and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  apb no 
for the disposal of a segment of a business 
consistent with sfas no 
 sfas no 
requires impairment losses to be recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amount 
we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets not held for sale by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with them 
at the time such evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flows of certain long lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying values of such assets  the assets are adjusted to their fair values 
we determined fair value as the net present value of future cash flows 
based on these evaluations  there were no adjustments to the carrying value of long lived assets in   or other than the asset write downs discussed in note goodwill and other intangible assets  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  were no longer subject to amortization 
goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives acquired prior to june  ceased to be amortized beginning january  in addition  sfas changed the way we evaluated goodwill and intangibles for impairment 
beginning january   goodwill and certain intangibles are no longer amortized  however  they are subject to evaluation for impairment at least annually using a fair value based test 
the fair value based test is a two step test 
the first step involved comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units to the carrying value of those reporting units 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  we are required to proceed to the second step 
in the second step  the fair value of the reporting unit would be allocated to the assets including unrecognized intangibles and liabilities of the reporting unit  with any residual representing the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized if and to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeded the implied value 
as prescribed by sfas no 
 we completed the transitional goodwill impairment test by the second quarter of which did not result in an impairment charge 
additionally  hollywood media established october  as its annual impairment test date and conducted required testing on that date in  and see note goodwill and other intangible assets  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
as of december   we are not aware of any items or events that would cause us to adjust the recorded value of hollywood media s goodwill for impairment 
future changes in estimates used to conduct the impairment review  including revenue projections or market values could cause the analysis to indicate that hollywood media s goodwill is impaired in subsequent periods and result in a write off of a portion or all of the goodwill 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations of our reporting units on the impairment calculation  we applied a hypothetical decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit 
this hypothetical decrease would not result in the impairment of goodwill of any reporting unit 
inflation and seasonality although we cannot accurately determine the precise effects of inflation  we do not believe inflation has a material effect on sales or results of operations 
we consider our business to be somewhat seasonal and expect net revenues to be generally higher during the second and fourth quarters of each fiscal year for our tekno books book licensing business as a result of the general publishing industry practice of paying royalties semi annually 
the ticketing business is also effected by seasonal variations with net revenues generally higher in the second quarter as a result of increased sales volumes due to the tony awards c and in the fourth quarter due to increased levels during the holiday period 
in addition  although not seasonal  our intellectual properties division and netco partners both experience fluctuations in their respective revenue streams  earnings and cash flow as a result of the amount of time that is expended in the creation and development of the intellectual properties and their respective licensing agreements 
the recognition of licensing revenue is typically triggered by specific contractual events which occur at different points in time rather than on a regular periodic basis 
audit fees and other the aggregate audit fees incurred by hollywood media for professional services rendered for the audit of its annual financial statements for the year ended december  and for the reviews of the financial statements included in our quarterly reports on form q for the year ended december  were  refer to item principal accounting fees and services 
related party transactions hollywood media has been a party to various transactions with certain officers  directors and affiliates 
see the descriptions of such transactions in item  certain relationships and related transactions  and note related party transactions in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in our assets or liabilities that might occur due to changes in market rates and prices  such as interest or foreign currency exchange rates  as well as other relevant market rate or price changes 
interest rates charged on hollywood media s debt instruments are primarily fixed in nature 
we therefore do not believe that the risk of loss relating to the effect of changes in market interest rates is material 
we purchase and sell live theater tickets to shows in london s west end 
we minimize our exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates by taking steps to reduce the time lag between the purchase and payment of tickets for the london shows and the collection of related sales proceeds 
we further reduce our exposure by setting favorable currency conversion rates in our foreign ticket pricing 
we do not believe the risk of loss relating to adverse changes in currency exchange rates to be material
