what we do an executive summary we are a leading provider of egovernment services that help governments use the internet to reduce costs and provide a higher level of service to businesses and citizens 
we accomplish this currently through two primary divisions our core portal outsourcing businesses and our software services businesses 
in our core business  portal outsourcing  we enter into contracts primarily with state governments and design  build and operate web based portals on their behalf 
we enter into long term contracts  typically three to five years  and manage operations for each government partner through separate subsidiaries that operate as decentralized businesses with a high degree of autonomy 
our portals consist of web sites and applications that we build  which allow businesses and citizens to access government information online and complete transactions  including applying for a permit  retrieving driver s license records or filing a form or report 
we help increase our government partners revenues by expanding the distribution of their information assets and increasing the number of financial transactions conducted with governments 
we do this by marketing portal services and soliciting users to complete government based transactions and to enter into subscriber contracts that permit users to access the portal and the government information contained therein in exchange for transactional and or subscription user fees 
we are typically responsible for funding the up front investment and ongoing operational costs of the government portals 
our unique self funding business model allows us to reduce our government partners financial and technology risks and obtain revenues by sharing in the fees generated from egovernment services 
our clients benefit because they gain a centralized  customer focused presence on the internet 
businesses and citizens gain a faster  more convenient and more cost effective means to interact with governments 
on behalf of our government partners  we enter into separate agreements with various agencies and divisions of the government to provide specific services and to conduct specific transactions 
these agreements preliminarily establish the pricing of the transaction and data access services we provide and the division of revenues between the company and the government agency 
the government must approve prices and revenue sharing agreements 
we generally own all the applications developed under these contracts 
after completion of a defined contract term  the government agency typically receives a perpetual  royalty free license to the applications for use only 
if our contract were not renewed after a defined term  the government agency would be entitled to take over the portal in place with no future obligation of the company 
in some cases  we enter into contracts to provide consulting  development and management services to government portals in exchange for an agreed upon fee 
currently  we have contracts to provide portal outsourcing services for eighteen states  sixteen of which are operated under our self funding business model 
our closest competitors operate no more than one state portal each 
we also provide portal outsourcing services to five local governments 
our objective is to strengthen our position as the leading provider of internet based egovernment services 
key strategies to achieve this objective include renew all current outsourced government portal contracts we will strive to obtain renewal of all currently profitable outsourced government portal contracts 
in the history of our company  we have not lost a contract renewal opportunity or re bid process and are very proud of our highly reference able list of government partners 
in december  we won a re bid competition and signed a new contract for up to seven years with kansas  which became our first state partner in in january  we won a re bid competition and signed a new contract for up to six years with nebraska  which became our partner in win new portal contracts we intend to increase our number of government partners by leveraging our strong relationships with current government partners and our reputation for providing proven egovernment services 
we intend to continue marketing our services to new governments 
our expansion efforts include developing relationships and sponsors throughout an individual government entity  pursuing strategic technology alliances  making presentations at conferences of government executives with responsibility for information technology policy  and developing contacts with organizations that act as forums for discussions between these executives 
in  we entered into a two year portal outsourcing contract with the commonwealth of kentucky that includes renewal options for up to eight additional years 
increase transactional revenues from our existing government portals we intend to increase transactional revenues from our existing government portals by building new applications and services and increasing the adoption of existing portal applications and services 
we will accomplish this with new services offerings and expanded marketing initiatives 
in addition  we will work closely with the governance entities in our partner portals to evaluate the pricing of new and existing services to encourage higher usage and increased revenue streams 
we plan to continue our development of new online transactional services that enable government agencies to interact more effectively and efficiently with businesses  citizens and other government agencies 
we will continue to work with government agencies  professional associations and other organizations to better understand the current and future needs of our customers 
we will continue to work with our government partners to create awareness of the online alternatives to traditional government interaction through initiatives such as informational brochures  government voicemail recordings and inclusion of web site information on government communication materials 
in addition  we will continue to update our portals to highlight new government service information provided on the portals 
we plan to work with professional associations to directly and indirectly communicate to their members the potential convenience  ease of use and other benefits of the services our portals offer 
in addition to overall portal revenue growth  which includes both organic revenue growth and growth from new portal contract wins  an important financial metric that we use to gauge our success in increasing transactional revenues in our existing portal businesses is same state revenue growth 
we define same state revenue growth as the growth in revenues from states in operation and generating dmv revenues for at least two full years 
dmv revenues are transaction fees that we earn from the sale of driver history records through the portals we operate 
our long term goal is to grow same state revenues at per year 
same state portal revenues grew in  in and in as more fully described below  our same state revenue growth in was lower than normal due primarily to a year over year decrease in same state dmv revenues 
while we generally expect same state dmv revenues to grow only to per year  we experienced an unusually large increase in same state dmv revenues in due in part to more robust us automobile sales than in in  same state dmv revenues grew by primarily due to modest online record dmv price increases in two of our portal states in late and one portal state in late historically  such price increases have been infrequent  and our ability to grow same state dmv revenues has been limited  as such revenues have been driven by broader economic factors outside of our control 
an important component of same state revenue growth is the growth in non dmv transaction revenues  which are transaction fees generated by other means than from the sale of dmv records  for transactions conducted primarily by business users and  to a lesser extent  consumer users through our portals 
in  same state non dmv revenues grew at  up from in  but less than the we achieved in we are able to grow non dmv revenues by continually deploying new revenue generating applications and by driving adoption of existing applications within our existing portal businesses 
we believe the key factor in organically growing our revenues is to continually focus on driving adoption  and on implementation of new non dmv revenue generating applications 
continue to aggressively grow operating margins and profitability in addition to driving same state revenue growth  we will continue to increase profitability by driving cost containment efforts throughout the company and maintaining a lean organizational structure that fosters entrepreneurial decision making and innovation and accentuates the strong financial leverage of our business model 
an important financial metric that we use to gauge our success in improving portal profitability is portal gross profit percentage  or gross profit rate  which is calculated by dividing portal gross profit portal revenues minus cost of portal revenues  excluding depreciation by portal revenues 
our long term outlook is for our portal gross profit rate to be in the range 
our portal gross profit rate increased to in  from in and in the increase in was primarily attributable to a full year of operations from our kentucky portal  and to a modest increase in our same state gross profit rate 
new portal contract wins can have a short term negative impact on our gross profit percentage during the start up phase of a portal  as we incur costs to develop and implement the portal infrastructure prior to the time we begin to generate transaction revenues 
our portal gross profit could be similarly impacted in the future if we are successful in winning new portal contracts 
we carefully monitor our portal gross profit percentage to strike the balance between generating a solid return for our shareholders and delivering value to our government partners through reinvestment in our portal operations 
on a same state basis  our portal gross profit rate was  an increase of less than from while same state portal revenues grew by in  same state cost of portal revenues increased by approximately  primarily as a result of the addition of personnel in several of our portals due to our continued growth and reinvestment in our core business 
in addition  a growing percentage of our non dmv revenues are generated from online applications whereby users pay for information or transactions via credit cards 
we typically earn a percentage of the credit card transaction amount  but also must pay an associated fee to the merchant bank that processes the credit card transaction 
we earn a lower gross profit percentage on these transactions as compared to our other non dmv applications 
however  we anticipate these revenues and the associated merchant card fees to continue to increase in the future  as these transactions contribute favorably to our operating income growth 
our same state gross profit rate was slightly less than in and slightly less than in as discussed above  our long term goal is to grow same state revenues at per year  while keeping same state cost of portal revenue growth in the range 
as a result  we expect our same state gross profit rate to increase modestly on an annual basis 
we also view selling administrative costs  expressed as a percentage of revenue  to be an important indicator of our success in keeping corporate level expenses flat year over year 
selling administrative costs as a percentage of revenue decreased to in  from in and in going forward  we expect selling administrative costs as a percentage of revenues to continue to decline as our revenues grow and our corporate expenses remain relatively flat year over year 
finally  our consolidated operating margin operating income or loss divided by consolidated revenues is an important measure of our overall profitability 
this metric improved to in from in and in we expanded rapidly following our initial public offering in july and incurred substantial operating losses through mid primarily as a result of our acquired software services businesses  which are further discussed below 
throughout this time period  our core outsourced portal operations have grown and have been profitable 
as part of a broad strategic refocusing on our profitable core outsourced portal business during  we exited our eprocurement and transportation businesses and restructured the other software services businesses in an effort to accelerate our path to profitability 
we became profitable in the second half of and have been profitable since that time 
we have focused the business on operations we believe have demonstrable ability to produce positive net income and sustainable cash flow in the future 
however  any projections of future results of operations and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
overview of business models and revenue recognition we classify our revenues and cost of revenues into two categories portal and software services 
the portal category includes revenues and cost of revenues primarily from our subsidiaries operating government portals on an outsourced basis 
the software services category includes revenues and cost of revenues primarily from our corporate filings  ethics elections  transportation and aol businesses 
we currently derive revenue from three main sources transaction based fees  fees for managing portal operations  and fees for application development 
each of these revenue types and the corresponding business models are further described below 
our portal outsourcing businesses we categorize our portal revenues according to the underlying source of revenue 
a brief description of each category follows dmv transaction based these are transaction fees from the sale of electronic access to driver history records  referred to as dmv records  from our state portals to data resellers  insurance companies and other pre authorized customers on behalf of our state partners  and are generally recurring 
non dmv transaction based these are transaction fees from other sources than the sale of dmv records  for transactions conducted by business users and consumer users through our portals  and are generally recurring 
for a representative listing of non dmv services we currently offer through our portals  refer to part i  item in this form k 
portal management these are recurring fees paid to us by our government partners for the operation of portals  which typically supplement transaction based fees 
software development these are fees from the performance of software development projects and other time and materials services for our government partners 
while we actively market these services  they may not have the same degree of predictability as our transaction based or portal management revenues 
the highest volume  most commercially valuable service we offer is electronic access to dmv records through our insurance industry records exchange network 
this service accounted for approximately of our portal revenues in  in and in we believe that while this application will continue to be an important source of revenue  its contribution as a percentage of total revenues on an individual portal basis will decline modestly as other sources grow 
choicepoint  which resells these records to the auto insurance industry  accounted for approximately of portal revenues in  in and in portal revenues accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenues in  in and in we expect portal revenues as a percentage of total revenues to continue to increase in future years as our portal business continues to grow and we continue to wind down certain of our software services businesses 
in our outsourced portal businesses for  dmv transaction based revenues represented approximately of portal revenues  non dmv transaction based revenues represented approximately  software development represented  and portal management represented approximately 
we expect software development and portal management revenues as a percentage of total portal revenues to decline in the future due to our focus on growing transaction based revenues  which are more predictable and recurring in nature 
in  approximately of our transaction based revenues related to business to government transactions  while the remaining related to citizen to government transactions 
transaction based revenues from our outsourced state portal business units are highly correlated to population  but are also affected by pricing policies established by government entities for public records  the number and growth of commercial enterprises and the government entity s development of policy and information technology infrastructure supporting electronic government 
choicepoint and other data resellers and companies who access dmv records electronically through our insurance industry records exchange network have entered into contracts with the portals our subsidiaries operate to request these records from the states of alabama  arkansas  hawaii  idaho  indiana  iowa  kansas  kentucky  maine  montana  nebraska  oklahoma  rhode island  tennessee  utah and virginia 
under the terms of these contracts  we provide data resellers with driver s license and traffic records that vary by contract  for fees that currently range from to per record requested 
the fees charged to all entities that access dmv records are the same for records of a particular state 
we typically collect the entire fee  of which a certain portion is remitted to the state by statute 
these contracts are generally self renewing until canceled by one side or the other  and generally may be terminated at any time after days notice 
these contracts may be terminated immediately at the option of any party upon a material breach of the contract by the other party 
furthermore  these contracts are immediately terminable if the state statute allowing for the public release of these records is repealed 
we charge for electronic access to records on a per record basis and  depending upon government policies  also on a fixed or sliding scale bulk basis 
our fees are set by negotiation with the government agencies that control the records and are typically approved by a government sanctioned oversight body 
we recognize revenues from transactions primarily transaction based information access fees and filing fees on an accrual basis net of the transaction fee due to the government  and we bill end user customers primarily on a monthly basis 
we typically receive a majority of payments via electronic funds transfer and credit card within days of billing and remit payment to governments within to days of the transaction 
the costs that we pay state agencies for data access are accrued as accounts receivable and accounts payable at the time revenue from the access of public information is recognized 
we must remit a certain amount or percentage of these fees to government agencies regardless of whether we ultimately collect the fees 
the pricing of transactions varies by the type of transaction and by state 
currently  under our contracts with the states of new hampshire and vermont  we provide consulting  development and management services for these government portals predominantly under a time and materials model 
we expense as incurred all employee costs to start up  operate and maintain outsourced government portals as costs of performance under the contracts because  after the completion of a defined contract term  the government entities with which we contract typically receive a perpetual  royalty free license to the applications we developed 
such costs are included in cost of portal revenues in the consolidated statements of operations 
our software services businesses corporate filings our corporate filings business derives the majority of its revenues from fixed price application development contracts and recognizes revenues on the percentage of completion method 
the average size contract for this business has historically been approximately million to million 
however  as further discussed below  our five year contract with the california secretary of state is valued at approximately million 
in  our corporate filings business accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenues 
in september  our corporate filings business was awarded a five year contract by the california secretary of state to build an information management and retrieval system for the business programs division of the california secretary of state 
this contract is valued at approximately million and is the largest government contract we have ever been awarded 
this award is both the nation s largest state egovernment filing initiative on record and the most comprehensive secretary of state outsourced filing system project in the united states 
the web enabled document management and filing system will increase efficiency and reduce expenses for the state by eliminating paperwork and decreasing processing and turnaround times 
upon completion  the new system will allow agency customers  primarily from the banking and legal communities  to search  retrieve  and submit documents online 
customers will also be able to pay fees for a variety of transactions  including new incorporation document filings  trademark registrations  and uniform commercial code filings 
the contract includes comprehensive back office document and revenue management systems  web and internet applications that will take approximately of the agency s business programs division s services online  and imaging and indexing of more than ten million historical document pages 
we will also provide three years of onsite support and maintenance for the system 
we currently believe this contract will be profitable 
at december   our corporate filings business was primarily engaged in servicing its contract with the california secretary of state 
this business is not actively marketing its applications and services to new government entities 
ethics elections our ethics elections business derives the majority of its revenues from time and materials application development and maintenance outsourcing contracts and recognizes revenues as services are provided 
in  our ethics elections business accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenues 
at december   our ethics elections business was primarily engaged in servicing its contracts with the federal election commission and the state of michigan 
transportation our transportation business has historically derived the majority of its revenues from cost plus time and materials application development contracts with governments and recognizes revenues as services are provided 
revenues from our transportation business were not significant in we decided to wind down our transportation business in and do not expect to generate substantial revenues from this business in our transportation business did not qualify as a discontinued operation as of december  aol in august  we entered into an agreement with america online  inc to deliver government information  services and applications through aol s government guide 
nic and aol shared revenues generated from the license or sale of advertisement on or through the government guide 
we recognized our share of aol s advertising revenues when notified of the amount due from aol  which is approximately one month after the advertisement is provided 
we experienced a significant decrease in revenues from our aol business in as compared to prior periods due to weakness in aol s online advertising operations 
our contract with aol expired on december   and was not renewed 
revenues from our aol business were not significant in critical accounting policies many estimates and assumptions involved in the application of generally accepted accounting principles have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and on the comparability of such reported information over different reporting periods 
a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
note that the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies described below with the audit committee of the board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosure relating to it in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
application development contracts our corporate filings business  nic conquest  derives the majority of its revenues from fixed price application development contracts and recognizes revenues on the percentage of completion method  utilizing costs incurred to date as compared to the estimated total costs for each contract 
revenues and profits from these contracts are based on management s estimates to complete and are reviewed periodically  with adjustments recorded in the period in which the revisions are made 
use of the percentage of completion method requires that management be able to reasonably estimate total contract costs and costs to complete at each reporting date 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as they are determinable 
we continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability 
our corporate filings business has incurred substantial losses under its fixed price contracts in the past primarily due to cost overruns as further discussed in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
it is possible that our costs will similarly exceed revenues in the future  as a result of unforeseen difficulties in the creation of an application called for in a contract  unforeseen challenges in ensuring compatibility with existing systems  rising development  subcontractor and personnel costs or other reasons 
if this occurs  particularly on our contract with the california secretary of state  which we currently expect to be profitable  our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could be seriously harmed 
because of the inherent uncertainties in estimating the costs of completion  it is at least reasonably possible that the estimate will change in the near term 
deferred income taxes we recognize deferred income taxes for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end based on enacted laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
we have a recent history of unprofitable operations primarily due to operating losses incurred in the software services companies we have acquired since september these losses have generated significant federal tax net operating losses  or nols 
we had available at december   total nol carryforwards for federal tax purposes of approximately million that will expire in the years million  million and million  respectively 
as discussed above  we became profitable in the second half of we expect the company to continue to be profitable and generate taxable income  and have focused the business on operations we believe have demonstrable ability to produce positive taxable income and sustainable cash flow in the future 
we believe it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income from future operations to fully utilize the nol carryforwards prior to expiration 
based on our current projections  we expect to fully utilize the nol carryforwards by the end of the recorded amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward periods are reduced 
there is considerable management judgment necessary to determine future taxable income  and accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from such estimates 
for additional discussion of deferred income taxes  see deferred tax assets section below and note to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
for the years ended december  and  total net deferred tax assets  including nol carryforwards  were the largest asset included in our consolidated balance sheets and comprised approximately and  respectively  of our total assets 
goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets as further discussed below  during we recorded impairment losses totaling million relating mostly to goodwill arising from the idt acquisition and intangible assets relating to our aol business 
in  we recorded impairment losses totaling million relating mostly to goodwill and intangible assets arising from business combinations and software development costs 
at december  and  our recorded intangible assets were not significant 
we had no goodwill remaining after the idt goodwill impairment loss recorded by the company in at each balance sheet date  and whenever events or changes in circumstances warrant  management assesses the carrying value of long lived assets for possible impairment based primarily on the ability to recover the balances from expected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis were to be less than the carrying amount of the intangible asset  an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
we estimate future discounted and undiscounted cash flows and fair values based upon historical performance  trends  and various other factors 
a significant change in the assumptions underlying the cash flows or fair values could result in a different determination of impairment loss and or the amount of any impairment 
software services businesses discontinued operations and impairment losses nic commerce as further discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k  in the second quarter of  we exited our domestic eprocurement business entirely and have classified the results of operations of nic commerce as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
idt during the second quarter of  we identified indicators of possible impairment of goodwill related to the idt acquisition 
the impairment indicators included  but were not limited to  the recent underperformance of this business relative to plan  the expected underperformance of this business as compared to projected future operating results  and nic s strategic refocusing on our core portal outsourcing business and away from our software services businesses 
specifically  we determined that the recent downturn in idt s financial performance was expected to continue and would not be temporary  as we previously expected 
this was a reversal of idt s historical trend of modest profitability  and was primarily attributable to government imposed contract delays and funding shortfalls on the part of governments with whom idt had contracted 
management reached the conclusion that it would not continue to support idt s business and decided to wind down idt s operations 
accordingly  we concluded the remaining goodwill related to the idt acquisition no longer had value and recognized a million impairment loss in the second quarter of idt did not qualify as a discontinued operation as of december  aol during the second quarter of  we identified indicators of possible impairment of the cash and warrant portions of the carriage fee paid and payable to aol pursuant the interactive services agreement between the company and aol 
beginning in the second quarter of  our share of revenues generated from aol s sale of advertisement through government guide had increased steadily on a sequential quarterly basis 
however  in the second quarter of  revenues from our aol business decreased precipitously as compared to recent quarters 
this was primarily a result of lower aol government guide advertising revenues due to weakness in the overall advertising market in general and the online advertising market in particular 
this drop in advertising revenues was in contrast to the growth in revenues our aol business had experienced historically 
additionally  based on discussions with aol personnel at the time  we did not expect our aol business to achieve revenue growth consistent with the growth it had experienced historically 
aol had specifically noted in their filings with the sec at the time that they expected the weakness in the online advertising market to continue for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we reduced the revenue forecast for our aol business for the remainder of and through the completion of our contract with aol 
management determined that the expected future cash flows of its aol business would not be sufficient to recover the cash carriage fee we would have recognized over the remaining term of the contract with aol 
through the second quarter of  we had made cash payments to aol totaling approximately million  with approximately  recorded as a prepaid expense at june   and had to pay the remaining  in a series of three quarterly installments ending in march additionally  management determined the future cash flows of this business would not be sufficient to recover the unamortized carrying amount of the fully vested warrants issued to aol  which totaled approximately million at june  the carrying amount of the fully vested warrants was previously recorded as an intangible asset in the consolidated balance sheet 
as a result  we recognized a million impairment loss in the second quarter of financial analysis of years ended december   and in this section  we are providing more detailed information about our operating results and changes in financial position over the past three years 
this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form k 
key financial metrics revenue growth outsourced portals same state revenue growth outsourced portals revenue growth software services gross profit outsourced portals gross profit software services selling administrative as of revenue operating income margin portal revenues 
in the analysis below  we have categorized our portal revenues according to the underlying source of revenue in thousands  with the corresponding percentage increase or decrease from the prior year period 
portal revenue analysis increase decrease from increase decrease from dmv transaction based non dmv transaction based portal management software development total portal revenues for increased  or approximately million  over of this increase   or approximately million  was attributable to an increase in same state portal revenues states in operation and generating dmv revenues for two full years and  or approximately million  was attributable to our newer portals including kentucky million  which began to generate dmv revenues in september  and alabama million  which began to generate dmv revenues in february these increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenues from our local portals  primarily due to the continued wind down of certain of our unprofitable local portal businesses 
in  the company ceased providing local portal services to dallas county  texas  the city of corpus christi  texas  and washtenaw county  michigan 
same state portal revenues in increased over primarily as a result of increased transaction revenues from several of our portals  most notably hawaii  montana  tennessee and utah 
our same state revenue growth in was higher than the growth we achieved in due in part to a increase approximately million in same state dmv transaction based revenues 
this increase was mainly attributable to modest dmv price increases in two portal states in late and in one portal state in late in addition  same state non dmv transaction based revenues increased  or approximately million  in due primarily to the addition of several new revenue generating applications in existing portals 
portal revenues for increased  or approximately million  over of this increase   or approximately million  was attributable to our newer outsourced state portal businesses including alabama million and kentucky million  and  or approximately million  was attributable to an increase in same state portal revenues 
same state portal revenues in increased over primarily as a result of increased transaction volumes from our iowa  indiana  utah and maine portals 
our iowa portal began to generate dmv revenues beginning in january as a result of a new contract with the state of iowa 
our iowa portal business did have a contract that provided recurring annual revenues prior to in the form of fees paid by the state to nic for the operation of the state s portal 
the contract was expanded in to add the dmv application  which enabled the portal to become self funded like the majority of our other state portal businesses 
the increase in revenues from our indiana  maine and utah portals was the result of the addition of several new non dmv applications during the year 
our same state revenue growth in was less than the growth we had achieved in recent years due primarily to a year over year decrease in same state dmv revenues 
while we generally expect same state dmv revenues to grow only to per year  we experienced a large increase in same state dmv revenues in due in part to more robust us automobile sales than in same state non dmv transaction based revenues increased  or approximately million  in due primarily to the addition of new revenue generating applications in existing portals 
cost of portal revenues 
cost of portal revenues in increased  or approximately million  over of this increase   or approximately million  was attributable to an increase in same state cost of portal revenues  and  or approximately million  was attributable to our newer state portal businesses  including kentucky and alabama 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in operating expenses from our local portals as a result of the continued wind down of certain of our unprofitable local portal businesses 
same state cost of portal revenues in increased  or approximately million  primarily as a result of the addition of personnel in several of our portals due to our continued growth and reinvestment in our core business 
also contributing to the increase in same state cost of portal revenues was an increase in merchant bank fees 
a growing percentage of our non dmv revenues are generated from online applications whereby users pay for information or transactions via credit cards 
we typically earn a percentage of the credit card transaction amount  but also must pay an associated fee to the merchant bank that processes the credit card transaction 
we earn a lower gross profit percentage on these transactions as compared to our other non dmv applications 
however  we anticipate these revenues and the associated merchant card fees to continue to increase in the future  as these transactions contribute favorably to our operating income growth 
our portal gross profit rate increased to in from in this increase was primarily attributable to a full year of operations in from our kentucky portal  and to a modest improvement in our same state gross profit rate 
on a same state basis  our portal gross profit rate was  an increase of less than from while same state portal revenues grew by in  same state cost of portal revenues increased by approximately  as further discussed above 
we are generally able to increase our same state portal gross profit rate by increasing business and citizen adoption of existing portal applications and building new non dmv revenue generating applications and services within existing portals while growing portal operating expenses at a rate considerably less than portal revenue growth 
we intend to continue to expand our portal operations by developing and promoting new non dmv applications and services within our existing portals 
accordingly  we expect our same state gross profit rate to continue to increase modestly in the foreseeable future 
cost of portal revenues in increased  or approximately million  over of this increase   or approximately million  was attributable to our newer state portal businesses  including alabama and kentucky  and  or approximately million  was attributable to a modest increase in same state cost of portal revenues 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in operating expenses from our local portals as a result of our cost reduction efforts in certain of our local portals to improve their profitability 
our portal gross profit rate increased to in from in this increase was primarily attributable to a full year of operations in from our alabama portal  and to an improvement in our local portal gross profit rate as a result of cost reduction efforts in certain of our local portals to improve their profitability 
our same state portal gross profit rate increased less than in due primarily to lower same state revenue growth in as further discussed above

we recognize revenues and profit on our contract with the california secretary of state using the percentage of completion method as we make progress  utilizing costs incurred to date as compared to the estimated total cost for the contract 
software services revenues in decreased  or approximately million  from primarily as a result of a broad strategic refocusing in mid on our profitable core outsourced portal business and a de emphasis of certain of our acquired software services businesses  including our eprocurement  transportation and aol businesses  as further discussed above 
revenues from our aol business decreased by approximately million to less than million in as previously disclosed  and as further discussed above  we experienced a significant decrease in revenues from our aol business in as compared to prior periods due to continued weakness in the online advertising market 
in addition  revenues from our transportation business  idt  decreased by approximately million to million in as previously disclosed  we decided to wind down this business in total corporate filings revenues decreased by million to million in we recognized approximately million in revenue from our contract with the california secretary of state in compared to million in revenues from legacy corporate filing contracts  primarily relating to arkansas and oklahoma  decreased by million to million in revenues from our ethics elections business increased by approximately million to million in as a result of additional work performed under its contract with the federal election commission 
cost of software services revenues 
the decrease in cost of software services revenues in was mostly due to a decrease in project costs incurred on our contract with the california secretary of state  and was relatively consistent with the corresponding decrease in project revenues as further discussed above 
in addition  in the third quarter of  we reversed approximately million in loss accruals relating to our legacy business filing contracts in arkansas and oklahoma  as these contracts are expected to cost less to complete than our previous estimates for further discussion  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
this adjustment positively affected our software services gross profit rate for additionally  in the first quarter of  we reduced our expected profit margin on our contract with the california secretary of state from approximately to due to an increase in estimated costs to complete the contract as a result of adding project management resources to the project 
this margin adjustment adversely affected our software services gross profit rate for cost of software services revenues in decreased  or approximately million  from cost of software services revenues for includes a net charge of million for anticipated costs in excess of revenues to be recognized under certain of our application development contracts in our corporate filings business see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
also contributing to the decrease in expenses in was a million decrease relating to our aol business and a million decrease relating to our transportation business 
as previously disclosed  in the second quarter  we determined that the expected future cash flows of our aol business would not be sufficient to recover the cash carriage fee and common stock warrant amortization expense we would have recognized over the remaining term of the contract with aol and recorded a million impairment loss 
as a result  the company no longer recorded the cash portion of the carriage fee expense in cost of software services revenues  which approximated million in in addition  we significantly reduced the number of dedicated employees related to aol and  as a result  reduced employee payroll costs by approximately million in selling administrative 
selling administrative expenses in increased  or approximately million  from  as a result of a modest increase in costs for new business development initiatives 
selling administrative expenses in decreased  or approximately million  from the majority of this decrease was a reduction in expenses from our software services businesses resulting from our restructuring and cost containment efforts 
selling administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were   and for  and  respectively 
we expect selling administrative costs as a percentage of revenues to continue to decline as our revenues grow and our corporate expenses remain relatively flat year over year 
impairment loss 
for additional information on the impairment losses we recorded in  refer to the discussion above under software services businesses discontinued operations and impairment losses and in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
stock compensation 
stock compensation for consisted primarily of amortization of deferred compensation expense related to common stock options granted to senior level executives and other key employees in and by the end of the second quarter of  all deferred compensation expense relating to options granted in and had been recognized 
depreciation amortization 
depreciation amortization expense decreased in as certain capital expenditures made after our initial public offering in have become fully depreciated 
depreciation amortization expense decreased in by approximately million from as further discussed above  in the second quarter of  we determined the future cash flows of our aol business would not be sufficient to recover the unamortized carrying amount of the fully vested warrants issued to aol and recorded a million impairment loss in the second quarter of as a result  we no longer recorded amortization expense relating to these warrants 
we recognized approximately million in warrant amortization expense in depreciation expense decreased by approximately million in as certain capital expenditures made after our initial public offering in have become fully depreciated 
we expect depreciation expense for to range from to million 
we do not expect to incur amortization expense in equity in net loss of affiliates 
equity in net loss of affiliates represents our share of losses of companies in which we have had equity method investments that give us the ability to exercise significant influence  but not control  over the investees 
in the first quarter of  we invested in two private companies involved in the egovernment services industry  tidemark and e filing  primarily for strategic purposes 
in the fourth quarter of  we invested in egs  a private joint venture among swiss venture capital firm etf group  london based venture development organization vesta group  and our european subsidiary  nic european business ltd 
in may  a private technology company acquired tidemark 
we recognized a million gain in the second quarter of relating to our previous equity investment in tidemark 
in may  e filing repurchased the company s ownership interest in e filing for  which approximated the carrying value of the company s investment at the date of the repurchase 
the company had no investment balance remaining in e filing after the repurchase 
as a result of a modification to the egs joint venture agreement  the company has accounted for its investment in egs under the cost method beginning in fiscal at december   we held no investments in affiliates or joint ventures accounted under the equity method 
see note income taxes 
we recognized income tax expense in and and an income tax benefit in our effective tax rate was approximately in  in and in our income tax provision in was less than the amount customarily expected due primarily to deferred tax asset adjustments recorded in the fourth quarter of totaling a benefit of approximately million as more fully described in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
prospectively  we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in this improvement was primarily the result of approximately million in milestone payments received from the california secretary of state and a year over year improvement in our operating income  excluding non cash charges 
these payments from the california secretary of state contributed to the decrease in unbilled revenues in the current year 
we have been recognizing revenues on this contract under percentage of completion accounting as progress is made on the project 
however  we do not receive regular progress payments from the california secretary of state  which contributes to fairly significant fluctuations in unbilled revenues each reporting period 
the increase in accrued expenses in the current year was partially due to accrued subcontractor costs on this project  as we are not required to pay certain subcontractors until we receive major milestone payments under the contract 
approximately million of the milestone payments received in were paid to certain subcontractors during the year 
we are scheduled to receive two additional milestone payments of approximately million each in the future  currently estimated to be over the course of the next to months 
the first payment will be for the delivery of the business entity filing system into acceptance testing 
the second payment will be for the acceptance of the business entity filing system by the secretary of state and commencement of the associated maintenance period 
the decrease in accounts payable in was mainly attributable to the continued wind down of certain of our unprofitable local portal businesses during the year  as further discussed above 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to net cash used of million in this improvement was primarily the result of a year over year improvement in operating income  excluding non cash charges  that was partially offset by a negative net change in operating assets and liabilities as compared to the prior year 
the primary contributor to this negative net change was an increase in unbilled revenues on our corporate filings contract with the california secretary of state 
the increase in accrued expenses in was partially due to accrued subcontractor costs on this project 
the increases in accounts receivable and accounts payable in were mainly attributable to an increase in revenues from our portal businesses in alabama and kentucky  which began to generate dmv revenues in a million increase in accounts receivable  and to an increase in fourth quarter tax receipts from tax filing applications in hawaii  indiana and dallas county a million increase in accounts receivable 
the majority of these tax receipts were remitted to our government partners in january we recognize revenue from providing outsourced government portal services net of the transaction fees due to the government when the services are provided 
the fees that the company must remit to the government are accrued as accounts payable and accounts receivable at the time services are provided 
as a result  trade accounts receivable and accounts payable reflect the gross amounts outstanding at the balance sheet dates 
gross billings for the years ended december  and were approximately million and million  respectively 
the company calculates days sales outstanding by dividing trade accounts receivable at the balance sheet date by gross billings for the period and multiplying the resulting quotient by the number of days in that period 
days sales outstanding for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
we believe that working capital is an important measure of our short term liquidity 
working capital  defined as current assets minus current liabilities  increased to million at december  from million at december  our current ratio  defined as current assets divided by current liabilities  at december  was compared to at december  the increase in both of these measures was primarily attributable to an increase in total cash and cash equivalents as a result of the significant increase in our operating cash flow in investing activities in resulted in net cash used of million  reflecting million in capital expenditures  which were partially offset by the maturity of marketable securities as further discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k and proceeds from the sale of our minority investment in e filing as further discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
capital expenditures in the current year were mainly attributable to computer equipment purchases relating to our move to a new data center for company wide hosting and disaster recovery purposes  in addition to normal fixed asset additions in our portal business 
investing activities in resulted in net cash used of million for capital expenditures  which were primarily for normal fixed asset additions in our outsourced portal business  including web servers  purchased software and office furniture and equipment 
investing activities resulted in net cash generated of million in  reflecting million in net maturities of our marketable securities used for funding operations and for collateral purposes 
in conjunction with our contract with the california secretary of state  in march  we issued a million letter of credit as collateral for a performance bond required by the contract 
the letter of credit was fully collateralized by cash at the time of issuance 
investing activities in also reflect approximately million of capital expenditures and million in contributions to the egs joint venture 
financing activities in resulted in net cash generated of approximately million  reflecting a million reduction in our cash collateral requirements under the financing arrangement that covers all of the company s outstanding letters of credit  term note payable  which was paid off in  and working capital line of credit as further discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
financing activities in also reflect million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and our employee stock purchase program 
although we cannot predict the annual amount of proceeds we expect to receive from employee stock options in the future  we expect that our employees will continue to exercise vested stock options that have intrinsic value 
at december   approximately million employee stock options were exercisable at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
the closing price of our common stock on december  was per share 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately million in  primarily reflecting a million decrease in restricted cash to collateralize our bank note payable and certain bank letters of credit issued on behalf of the company  and million in payments on our note payable 
we received approximately million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and our employee stock purchase program 
net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately million in  primarily reflecting a million increase in restricted cash to collateralize our bank note payable and certain bank letters of credit issued on behalf of the company  and million in payments to repurchase common stock from a former executive of the company 
we received approximately million in proceeds in from the exercise of employee stock options  the majority of which came from a former executive of the company  and from our employee stock purchase program 
at december   our total unrestricted cash balance was million compared to million at december  at december   we had posted million in cash as collateral for bank letters of credit issued on behalf of the company 
we issue letters of credit as collateral for performance on certain of our government contracts and as collateral for certain performance bonds 
these irrevocable letters of credit are generally in force for one year 
we expect our collateral requirements to continue to ease over time as we continue to produce consecutive quarters of profitability and earnings growth 
however  even though we expect to be profitable in and beyond  we may not be able to sustain our current levels of profitability or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
we will need to generate sufficiently higher revenues while containing costs and operating expenses if we are to achieve growing profitability 
we cannot be certain that our revenues will continue to grow or that we will ever achieve sufficient revenues to become profitable on a long term  sustained basis 
if we are not able to sustain profitability  our cash collateral requirements may increase 
had the company been required to post cash collateral at december  for the face value of all performance bonds which are partially supported by letters of credit and our line of credit in conjunction with a corporate credit card agreement  unrestricted cash would have decreased and restricted cash would have increased by approximately million 
we believe that our currently available liquid resources and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements  capital expenditure requirements  and current growth initiatives for at least the next twelve months without the need of additional capital 
however  we may need to raise additional capital before this period ends to further fund operations  including the costs to fund our contract with the california secretary of state and subcontractors on that project  collateralize letters of credit  which we are required to post as collateral for performance on certain of our outsourced government portal contracts and as collateral for certain performance bonds  support our expansion into other states and government agencies beyond what is contemplated in if unforeseen opportunities arise  expand our product and service offerings beyond what is contemplated in if unforeseen opportunities arise  respond to unforeseen competitive pressures  and acquire complementary technologies beyond what is contemplated in if unforeseen opportunities arise 
any projections of future earnings and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
if our unrestricted cash and cash generated from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity securities  issue debt securities  or increase our working capital line of credit 
the sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to the company s shareholders 
there can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
at december   we were bound by performance bond commitments totaling approximately million on certain government contracts 
of this amount  million relates to the performance bond requirement on our contract with the california secretary of state  which is collateralized by a million letter of credit 
upon acceptance of the business entity filing system and commencement of the associated maintenance period  which we currently expect to take place within the next to months  the company will no longer be required to provide a performance bond under this contract 
we have never had any defaults resulting in draws on performance bonds 
we do not have off balance sheet arrangements or significant exposures to liabilities that are not recorded or disclosed in our financial statements 
while we have significant operating lease commitments for office space  those commitments are generally tied to the period of performance under related contracts 
the following table sets forth our future contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations long term debt obligations capital lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual cash obligations deferred tax assets at december   we have recorded net deferred tax assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  totaling approximately million 
we estimate that we must generate at least million of future taxable income to realize those deferred tax assets 
to achieve a sufficient level of future taxable income  we intend to continue to pursue our current strategy of adding new government partners  broadening our service offerings in our existing government portals  and increasing transactional revenues from our existing government portals 
based on information currently known to management  we believe it is more likely than not that the company will realize the deferred tax assets

as of december   our net deductible temporary differences  exclusive of net operating loss carryforwards  total approximately million 
our federal income tax loss carryforward of approximately million expires as follows million expires in  million expires in and million expires in our state income tax loss carryforwards of approximately million may be used over various periods ranging from to years
