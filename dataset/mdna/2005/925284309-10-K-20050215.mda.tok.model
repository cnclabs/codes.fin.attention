item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors risks related to our business we increasingly depend on our international operations 
the table below presents the company s revenue by region in thousands percent change in fiscal year twelve months ended october  from from in thousands total revenues by geographic area north america europe asia pacific total percent of revenues by geographic area north america europe asia pacific total research and development we have committed  and expect to continue to commit  substantial resources to our research and development efforts 
our current development efforts are focused on ongoing efforts to improve the performance and scalability of our core products  supporting new industry standards for our versant open access product  improving the integration of our products with leading third party technology providers  and providing support and or integration with existing and emerging computing standards 
our research and development expenses were approximately million in the year ended october   million in the year ended october  and million in the year ended october  to date  all research and development expenditures have been expensed as incurred 
to date  our products have been developed almost entirely internally by our own research and development personnel  with the principal exceptions of fastobjects  which we acquired in connection with our acquisition of poet and versant open access  which is based on the core technology we purchased form jdo genie pty ltd 
we selectively supplement our internal staff with outside consultants having expertise in specific areas 
our research and development team consists mainly of software engineers with significant experience and expertise in technologies such as object oriented software development  including java  relational database technology  platform engineering  design and integration  large scale run time environments  and middleware technologies 
we perform some of our porting and enhancement engineering work in our development office in india 
versant india  our wholly owned subsidiary  had employees as of october  and occupies an approximately  square foot facility leased in pune  india 
pursuant to a consulting agreement  we have contracted to have some research and development work for our versant open access product performed for certain periods by jdo genie pty ltd  a south african company from which we acquired core technology used in versant open access we believe that our future results will depend on our ability to improve our current technologies and to develop new products and product enhancements on a timely basis 
the market for our products and services is characterized by changing customer demands  rapid technological change and frequent introductions of new products and product enhancements 
customer requirements for products can change rapidly as a result of innovations or changes within the computer hardware and software industries  the introduction of new products and technologies including new hardware platforms and programming languages and the emergence  evolution or widespread adoption of industry standards 
the actual or anticipated introduction of new products  technologies and industry standards can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable or result in delays in the purchase of these products 
as a result  the life cycles of our products are difficult to estimate 
we have in the past experienced delays in the introduction of new products and features  and may experience similar delays in the future 
if we are unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop new products or enhancements of existing products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  our business  operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
intellectual property and other proprietary rights we rely primarily on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology 
for example  we license our software pursuant to signed license agreements and  to a lesser extent  shrink wrap licenses displayed in evaluation downloads and in software installation screens  which impose certain restrictions on the licensee s ability to utilize our software 
in addition  we take steps to avoid disclosure of our trade secrets  such as requiring persons with access to our proprietary information to execute non disclosure agreements with us  and we restrict access to our software source code 
we seek to protect our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection 
we were also awarded a united states patent no 
 for our proprietary cache system used within our product suites  which expires in competition for our vds and fastobjects products  we compete with companies offering object and relational database management systems  many of which are large and very well established corporations with broader product lines and stronger sales and distribution channels 
for our versant open access product  our competitors consist of both relational database management companies  many of whom have incorporated  or are expected to incorporate in their systems object oriented interfaces and other functionality more directly competitive with our technologies  as well as companies who already have substantial experience in object oriented software development and provide components similar to those included in versant open access 
many of our competitors  especially oracle and computer associates  have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  service and other resources  significantly greater name recognition  broader product offerings and a larger installed base of customers 
in addition  many of our competitors have well established relationships with our current and potential customers 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors  and competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business  pricing  operating results and financial condition 
for a more detailed discussion of the competition we face in our business  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors risks related to our industry our products face significant competition 
employees as of october   we and our subsidiaries had a total of employees  of whom were based in the united states  in europe  and in india 
of the total  employees were engaged in engineering and technical services  were engaged in sales and marketing  were engaged in the services organization and were engaged in general administration and finance 
to our knowledge  none of our employees is represented by a labor union with respect to employment with versant 
we have experienced no organized work stoppage to date and believe that our relationship with our employees is good 
our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our key technical  sales and senior management personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
item properties 
our principal administrative  sales  marketing and research and development operations are located in fremont  california 
our current lease  which expires in june  is for a building of approximately  square feet 
however  we only occupy approximately  square feet of this space  and in the fourth quarter of fiscal year we recorded a restructuring charge to reflect this reduced space usage in future periods 
additionally  we lease a sales office in plano  texas and our international subsidiaries lease space  generally under multi year operating lease agreements  in pune  india  and in both munich and hamburg  germany 
in connection with the restructuring event previously mentioned  we closed the sales office that we formerly leased in basingstoke  england 
we believe that our current facilities will be adequate for our requirements for the next several years

price range of common stock our common stock is quoted on the nasdaq smallcap market under the symbol vsnt 
our common stock commenced trading on the nasdaq national market on july  from july  until march  our common stock was traded on the nasdaq smallcap market 
from march  to september   our common stock was traded on the nasdaq national market 
since october  our common stock has been quoted on the nasdaq smallcap market 
we requested that listing of our common stock be transferred to the nasdaq smallcap market as of october  due to the fact that it then seemed unlikely that  in the near term  we would continue to be able to satisfy the listing criteria of the nasdaq national market system 
the following table lists the high and low intra day prices of our common stock reported on the nasdaq stock market for the periods indicated during the last two fiscal years year ended october  high low fourth quarter third quarter second quarter first quarter year ended october  fourth quarter third quarter second quarter first quarter on january  the closing price of our common stock was on the nasdaq stock market 
we do not currently meet the listing requirements necessary for our common stock to be listed on the nasdaq smallcap market due to the fact that our common stock has traded at a price below per share for sustained period 
to regain compliance with this listing requirement our common stock must trade at or above this price and we have been afforded a grace period to regain compliance with this requirement 
however  there remains a risk that we may be unable to regain compliance within the permitted grace period and that our shares could be delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors risks related to our stock in order for our common stock to continue to be listed on the nasdaq smallcap market  we must satisfy the nasdaq smallcap listing requirements  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
shareholders there were approximately holders of record of our common stock as of january  we believe that a significant number of beneficial owners of our common stock hold their shares in street name 
based on information available to us  we believe we have at least beneficial shareholders of our common stock 
dividend policy we have neither declared nor paid cash dividends on our common stock in the past 
we intend to retain future earnings  if any  to fund development and growth of our business and  therefore  do not anticipate that we will declare or pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future in connection with our merger with poet  the holders of our then outstanding shares of series a preferred stock had their outstanding shares of series a preferred stock converted into shares of our common stock at an increased conversion rate of three shares rather than two shares of common stock per each share of series a preferred stock 
in addition  the exercise price of certain common stock purchase warrants held by such preferred shareholders was reduced from to per share and the term of such warrants was extended by one year 
as a result of these actions a deemed dividend in the amount of approximately million was recorded during the three months ended april  please see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations deemed dividend to the preferred shareholders 
recent sales of unregistered securities on june   versant entered into an asset purchase agreement with jdo genie pty ltd  a privately held south african corporation 
pursuant to this agreement  versant purchased from jdo genie a software product  related technology and customer agreements 
as a portion of the purchase price of these assets  versant agreed to issue to jdo genie  shares of versant s common stock in a private transaction exempt from registration under the securities act  subject to approval of such issuance by the south african reserve bank under south africa s exchange control regulations within a certain time period  which versant and jdo genie extended by mutual agreement 
the issuance of versant common shares to jdo genie was approved by the south african reserve bank on january  and versant will issue these shares in reliance upon the exemption s from registration provided by section  and or regulation s under the securities act and or rules or of regulation d promulgated under the securities act 
in relying upon these exemptions versant considered the fact the issuance of the shares is being made to a single foreign corporate purchaser who has been provided publicly available information about versant and who was advised by legal counsel in connection with the transaction 
versant also considered that jdo genie has made appropriate investment agreements and representations to versant regarding its sophistication  knowledge  investment intent and compliance with resale restrictions applicable to restricted securities under the securities act 
versant has not agreed to register the shares issued to jdo genie under the securities act 
issuer purchases of equity securities no purchases of versant securities were made by or on behalf of versant in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended october  item selected financial data the following selected consolidated financial data has been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements 
the information set forth below is not necessarily indicative of results of our future operations  and should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and notes in this form k in order to fully understand factors that may affect the comparability of the information presented below and factors that might cause the following selected financial data not to be indicative of our future financial condition and results of operation 
in particular  it should be noted that because we changed our fiscal year end from december to october in  our transition period in was only a month period  which impacts the comparability of the following financial data 
in addition  in our fiscal year ended october  we completed our merger with poet  which increased our revenues and operating expenses for part of fiscal and substantially increased the number of our outstanding shares at fiscal year end for purposes of computing net loss per share in fiscal in fiscal we also incurred a restructuring charge of approximately million as well as a charge of approximately million related to the impairment of intangible assets

certain industry terms listed below  for reference are certain technical terms that are well known and often used in our industry 
we have defined these terms here to assist readers in better understanding the information provided in this report relational database data management software that stores data as tables and columns and can be accessed using an industry standard language called sql 
application server software deployment software that is used to build and deploy internet applications including commercial websites and company internal websites 
cache performance enhancing software that works with servers to improve their response times and throughput 
integration framework bridging software that can connect two disparate pieces of software together 
xml a standard format used to exchange data information between multiple software systems 
object oriented object oriented refers to software that uses smaller building blocks called objects to create larger software systems 
data integration data integration is a broad term for a variety of techniques that enable the data from one software system to be used in other software systems 
replication a range of technical approaches that enable multiple databases to be approximately synchronized  or to contain the same data 
disk mirroring uses specialized software  and often specialized hardware  to get the same data on two storage disks for the purpose of increasing the reliability or making a quick snapshot duplicate backup of a database 
fault tolerant server a server that offers higher reliability by the use of duplicated hardware and specialized software 
in the case of a failure of one database  the surviving database can continue offering normal service 
jee based an application or software component that is deployed in a java enterprise edition jee software environment 
zero administration an application that has been constructed so that no intervention from a database administrator is required 
native applications are constructed from a large number of individual software pieces 
the construction is usually easier and resulting application more reliable when the software pieces are built using the same software language  with compatible interaction methods  and running on the same operating system 
these interactions would be called native 
in the less desirable case  there will the need for conversions and adaptations  and the interactions could be called non native overview we are a california corporation and were incorporated in august we design  develop  market and support high performance object database management  data access and data integration software systems and provide related services  and these products and services collectively comprise our single operating segment  data management 
our data management product and services offer customers the ability to manage real time  xml and other types of hierarchical and navigational data 
our combined suite of products and services cater to a wide range of customers with a wide variety of needs ranging from solutions for small devices  like remote controls  up to full scale enterprise solutions  which manage hundreds of gigabytes of streaming data 
we believe that by using our data management solutions  customers cut hardware costs  accelerate and simplify development  significantly reduce administration costs and deliver products with a significant competitive edge 
on march  we finalized a merger in which we acquired poet holdings  inc  or poet 
poet brought two distinct lines of business to versant 
the first was poet s data management line of business  comprised of its fastobjects database product line 
the second was poet s catalog solutions business  comprised of the x solutions and esupplier solutions products which we disclosed as a separate catalog operating segment in our forms q for the three months ended april  and july  while we intend to continue integrating poet s database product line into our existing product line to provide a broader suite of data management products  in september we concluded the sale of the catalog solutions line of business  thereby returning our business back to the single operating segment  data management  that existed prior to our merger with poet 
on july  we acquired fastobjects inc  the exclusive distributor of poet s database product line in north america  and on june  we acquired data access technology from jdo genie pty ltd  a privately held south african company 
our data management business is currently comprised of the following products versant developer suite  or vds  a sixth generation object database management system that is used in high performance large scale real time applications 
versant enjin has been replaced by vds using vds s java data objects jdo language interface 
fastobjects  an object oriented database management system that can be embedded as a high performance component into customers applications and systems  and versant open access  a software product that provides business application developers a powerful object storage tool 
versant open access is offered in versions for applications written in java and microsoft 
net environments 
versant jdo  a product we announced last year  and the technology we acquired in june from jdo genie  have both been absorbed into the versant open access family 
as previously disclosed in a form k filed on august   we recorded a non cash charge in our statement of operations for the three months ended july  which represented the net book value of all assets associated with our versant real time framework product or vrtf 
vrtf was launched in fiscal  and was based on technology we acquired through our november acquisition of mokume software  inc while versant believes that the need exists in the marketplace for a product such as vrtf  our primary operational focus since merging with poet in march has been on integrating the two companies and leveraging their respective object database and data access product suites  with the goal of increasing versant s accessible market 
we have determined that this objective requires priority and a greater dedication of resources within our organization such that we cannot distract or dilute our efforts in this regard by continuing with the more early stage real time initiative addressed by vrtf 
we license our products and sell associated maintenance  training and consulting services to end users through our direct sales force and through value added resellers  systems integrators and distributors 
services are an important aspect of our business  and in the fiscal years ended october   and october   a majority of our revenues were derived from services 
in addition to these products and services  we resell related software developed by third parties 
to date  substantially all of our revenue has been derived from the following data management products and services sales of licenses for vds  fastobjects and to a much lesser extent  versant open access  maintenance and technical support services for our products  consulting services versant and poet consulting practice and dedicated ibm websphere consulting practice and training services  nonrecurring engineering fees received in connection with providing services associated with vds  the resale of licenses  and maintenance  training and consulting services for third party products that complement vds  and reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses we incurred that are booked as revenue in our statement of operations 
during fiscal  our primary focus was on concluding our acquisitions of poet holdings  inc fastobjects  inc 
and the data access technology from jdo genie pty ltd which is a component of our versant open access product line 
integration activities surrounding these mergers  including the restructuring plan we announced during october aimed at streamlining our operations and minimizing redundancies in light of the above acquisitions 
concluding the sale of our catalog business however  we also maintained focus on i sales and product development activities designed to obtain revenue growth from and enhance database our management products  and ii obtaining growth in our consulting service programs 
although we showed overall revenue growth in compared with  mainly due to our merger with poet  our net loss for was million comprised of the following the cost of our restructuring in was approximately million 
we expect this to yield future cost reduction benefits 
the conversion of series a preferred stock and the modification of the outstanding warrants held by our former series a preferred shareholders in conjunction with the poet merger resulted in an inducement to these preferred shareholders  which was recorded as a deemed dividend in the amount of approximately million in the three months ended april  this was a non cash expense 
a non cash charge in our statement of operations for the three months ended july  of approximately million representing the net book value of all assets associated with our versant real time framework product or vrtf 
the catalog business incurred significant operating losses from the date of acquisition through to the date of sale 
these operating losses together with the loss on the sale of this business accounted for approximately million of our net loss in and approximately million of the total net loss was due to the excess of other operating expenses and costs of revenue not mentioned above exceeding revenues as we proceeded through the integration activities surrounding our acquisitions 
for we expect that our principal sources of revenue will be licenses of vds and fastobjects  as well as maintenance  support  training and consulting services and to a lesser extent license and service revenues from our versant open access product 
we expect the relative mix of our revenues between license  maintenance and professional services to be substantially the same in compared with we continue to experience significant quarterly fluctuations in total revenue and believe this trend will continue in and is similar to many companies in our industry 
like many enterprise software companies  we do not operate with a significant backlog of orders 
our license revenue  in particular  is difficult to forecast and it is not atypical for a significant proportion of orders for a given quarter to be closed during the last month of that quarter 
information technology spending in general has been considerably depressed over the recent years and customers purchasing behavior has become more conservative 
we expect lengthy sales cycles and customers preference for licensing our software on an as needed basis versus the customer behavior we had seen in the late s of prepaying license fees in advance of usage to continue to be factors impacting our license revenues in the inherently unpredictable business cycle of an enterprise software company  together with the cautious macro economic environment  makes discernment of meaningful business trends difficult 
however in spite of this inherent uncertainty we expect overall revenues to grow in compared with we expect modest improvements in the north america region compared with our fiscal  in part due to our july acquisition of fastobjects  inc we also expect that europe will continue to contribute in excess of of our total revenues in fiscal due to the acquisition of poet  a company with primarily european business to date 
we also expect some traction in the marketplace with our versant open access product  although we expect revenues to be skewed more towards the second half of fiscal consistent with the past three years  we expect technology  telecommunications and defense to be our largest vertical market sectors in our agreement with ibm originally executed in year  through which we are subcontracted to work on websphere consulting engagements  was amended in august to extend its term to september   and was again amended in august to extend its term to september  we expect that this agreement will again be renewed in august or september of  although such renewal will not by itself guarantee that we will be engaged by ibm to perform any particular level of services and thus will not assure us of any ongoing level of revenue from ibm nor have there been any guarantees of this nature in the past 
however  we expect utilization of our websphere consulting practice to improve over primarily due to lower than normal utilization rates in our quarter ended july  and be more in line with utilization levels in we also expect increased professional services engagements in relation to our fastobjects product line 
we expect gross margin percentages to improve slightly over with expected revenue growth offset to an extent by increased amortization of purchased intangibles compared with overall  we expect operating expenses in to decrease compared with we expect marketing and sales expense and research and development expense in to return to similar levels to those in  largely due to the restructuring plan we committed to in october overall average engineering headcount levels in were consistent with though the geographic distribution was adjusted in light of the direct engineering staff we now have in hamburg  germany as result of the merger with poet 
this gives us the advantage of a skilled regional engineering element closer to the european market and customers  and is additionally a more cost effective model 
we expect to increase staffing in our indian operation over the course of we expect general and administrative expense to increase in  primarily due to the estimated cost of implementation and compliance with sarbanes oxley requirements 
we need to comply with this legislation for our year ended october   and we expect to incur significant third party consulting costs in assisting us to become compliant and increased audit fees related to the year end attestation our auditors will have to perform on the effectiveness of our internal controls 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of our assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base these estimates and judgments on information reasonably available to us  such as our historical experience and trends and industry  economic and seasonal fluctuations  and on our own internal projections that we derive from that information 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable under the circumstances  there can be no assurances that our estimates will be accurate given that the application of these accounting policies necessarily involves the exercise of subjective judgment and the making of assumptions regarding future uncertainties 
we consider critical those accounting policies that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  and that are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
these critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  goodwill and acquired intangible assets  impairment of long lived assets  the determination of our reserve for doubtful accounts and stock based compensation 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
revenue consists mainly of revenue earned under software license agreements  maintenance support agreements otherwise known as post contract customer support or pcs  and agreements for consulting and training activities 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a license agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date 
if there is an undelivered element under the license arrangement  we defer revenue based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of the fair value of the undelivered element  as determined by the price charged when the element is sold separately 
if vsoe of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements  we defer all revenue until sufficient evidence exists or all elements have been delivered 
under the residual method  discounts are allocated only to the delivered elements in a multiple element arrangement  with any undelivered elements being deferred based on the vendor specific objective evidence the value of such undelivered elements 
we typically do not offer discounts on future undeveloped products 
revenue from software license arrangements  including prepaid license fees  is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
delivery has occurred and there are no future deliverables except pcs 
fee is fixed and determinable 
if we cannot conclude that a fee is fixed and determinable  then assuming all other criteria have been met  revenue is recognized as payments become due in accordance with paragraph of sop  and collection is probable 
probability of collection is assessed using the following customer information credit service reports  bank and trade references  public filings  and or current financial statements 
prior payment experience is reviewed on all existing customers 
payment terms in excess of our standard payment terms of days net  are granted on an exception basis  typically in situations where customers elect to purchase development and deployment licenses simultaneously for an entire project and are attempting to align their payments with deployment schedules 
extended payment terms are only granted to customers with a proven ability to pay at the time the order is received  and with prior approval of our senior management 
in accordance with paragraph of sop  we have an established history of collection  without concessions  on longer term receivables 
in addition  the volume of extended payment term arrangements has dramatically reduced since fiscal consistent with customers adopting a more conservative approach to software purchases and their reluctance to prepay for licenses prior to usage 
we typically do not grant extended payment terms beyond one year 
if an acceptance period or other contingency exists  revenue is not recognized until satisfaction of the contingency  customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period  as applicable 
our license fees are non cancelable and non refundable and we do not make concessions or grant a refund for any unused amount 
also  our customer agreements for prepaid deployment licenses do not make payment of our license fees contingent upon the actual deployment of our software 
therefore a customer s delay or acceleration in his deployment schedule does not impact our revenue recognition 
revenue from related pcs for all product lines with the exception of deployments of fastobjects products is billed in advance of the service being provided and is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the pcs  which is generally twelve months 
pcs revenue from deployments of the fastobjects product line is paid in arrears of the service being provided and is recognized as revenue at the time the customer provides a report to us for deployments made during a given period 
training and consulting revenue is recognized when a purchase order is received  the services have been performed and collection is deemed probable 
consulting services are billed on an hourly  daily or monthly rate 
training classes are billed based on group or individual attendance 
we categorize our customers into two broad groups  end users and value added resellers vars 
our end user customers are companies who use our products internally and do not redistribute the product outside of their corporate organizations 
our var customers include traditional value added resellers  systems integrators  oems and other vendors who redistribute our products to external third party customers  either individually or as part of an integrated product 
we license our data management products through two types of perpetual licenses development licenses and deployment licenses 
development licenses are typically sold on a per seat basis and authorize a customer to develop an application program that uses our software product 
before an end user customer may deploy an application that it has developed under our development license  it must purchase deployment licenses based on the number of computers connected to the server that will run the application using our database management system 
for certain applications  we offer deployment licenses priced on a per user basis 
pricing of vds and fastobjects varies according to several factors  including the number of computer servers on which the application will run and the number of users that will be able to access the server at any one time 
customers may elect to simultaneously purchase development and deployment licenses for an entire project 
these development and deployment licenses may also provide for prepayment of a nonrefundable amount for future deployment 
vars and distributors purchase development licenses from us on a per seat basis on terms similar to those of development licenses sold directly to end users 
vars are authorized to sublicense deployment copies of our data management products that are either bundled or embedded in the var s applications and sold directly to end users 
vars are required to report their distribution of our software and are charged a royalty that is based either on the number of copies of application software distributed or computed as a percentage of the selling price charged by the vars to their end user customers 
these royalties from vars may be prepaid in full or paid upon deployment 
provided that all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met  revenue is recognized  i as to prepaid license arrangements  when the prepaid licenses are sold to the vars  and ii as to other license arrangements  at the time the var provides a royalty report to us for sales made by the var during a given period 
revenue from our resale of third party products is recorded at total contract value with the corresponding cost included in cost of sales when we act as a principal in these transactions and we assume the risks and rewards of ownership including the risk of loss for collection  delivery or returns 
when we do not assume the risks and rewards of ownership  revenue from our resale of third party products or services is recorded at contract value net of the cost of sales 
in the rare case that a customer requests engineering work for porting our product to an unsupported platform or customization of our software for specific functionality  or any other non routine technical work  we recognize revenue in accordance with sop and use either the percentage of completion or completed contract methods for recognizing revenue 
we use the percentage of completion method if we can make reasonable and dependable estimates of labor costs and hours required to complete the work in question 
we periodically review these estimates in connection with work performed and rates actually charged and recognize any losses when identified 
progress to completion is determined using the cost to cost method  whereby cost incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated cost determines the percentage completed and revenue recognized 
when using the percentage of completion method  the following conditions must exist an agreement must include provisions that clearly specify the rights regarding goods or services to be provided and received by both parties  the consideration to be exchanged and the manner and terms of settlement 
the buyer can be expected to satisfy his obligations under the contract 
versant can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract 
the completed contract method is used when reasonable or dependable estimates cannot be made 
as a result  in such situations we defer all revenue until such time as the work has been completed 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets we account for purchases of acquired companies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations sfas and account for the related acquired intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
in accordance with sfas  we allocate the cost of the acquired companies to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired according to their respect fair values as of the date of completion of the acquisition  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
certain intangible assets  such as acquired technology  are amortized to expense over time  while in process research and development costs ipr d  if any  are charged to operations at the acquisition date 
for the purpose of testing for goodwill impairment in our single data management operating segment we have aggregated the goodwill for the following acquisitions versant europe  acquired in  poet  acquired on march   technology of jdo genie  acquired on june   and fastobjects  inc  acquired on july  we filed a form k on august  reporting our assessment that the carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill acquired through our acquisition of mokume software inc  in november had been fully impaired 
consequently  for the quarter ended july  we recorded a charge of approximately million related to the write off of remaining mokume intangible assets and goodwill 
we test goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas  which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level which in our case is at the consolidated company level at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events  as provided in sfas we use the market approach to assess the fair value of our assets and this value is compared with the carrying value of those assets to test for impairment 
the total fair value of our assets is estimated by summing the fair value of our equity as indicated by our publicly traded share price and shares outstanding plus a control premium  debt and current liabilities 
under this approach  if the estimated fair value of our assets is greater than the carrying value of these assets  then there is no goodwill impairment 
if the estimated fair value of our assets is less than the carrying value of these assets then a memo allocation of the reporting unit s estimated fair value to its assets and liabilities as though the reporting unit had just been acquired in a business combination is required 
the impairment loss is the amount  if any  by which the implied fair value of goodwill is less than that reporting unit s goodwill carrying amount and would be recorded in earnings during the period of such impairment 
as required by sfas  we ceased amortizing goodwill effective november  prior to november   we amortized goodwill over five years using the straight line method 
identifiable intangibles are currently amortized over five years in relation to the jdo genie pty ltd acquisition  six years in relation to the fastobjects  inc acquisition and seven years in relation to the merger with poet  using the straight line method in each of these cases 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets  including intangible assets other than goodwill  for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires that long lived assets and intangible assets other than goodwill be evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
the recoverability test compares the carrying amount of the asset or asset group to the expected undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by these assets 
if the carrying amount of the asset or asset group is less than the expected undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by these assets  an impairment loss is recorded in earnings during the period of such impairment and is calculated as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset or asset group over its estimated fair value 
reserve for doubtful accounts we initially record our provision for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and then adjust this provision at the end of each reporting period based on a detailed assessment of our accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 
in estimating the provision for doubtful accounts  we consider  among other factors i the aging of the accounts receivable  ii trends within and ratios involving the age of the accounts receivable  iii the customer mix in each of the aging categories and the nature of the receivable ie license  consulting  maintenance  etc  iv our historical provision for doubtful accounts  v the credit worthiness of each customer  vi the economic conditions of the customer s industry  and vii general economic conditions 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management will also change  which could impact the level of our future provision for doubtful accounts 
specifically  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  affecting their ability to make payments  an additional provision for doubtful accounts may be required 
a number of our customers are in the telecommunications industry and  as part of our evaluation of the provision for doubtful accounts  we have considered not only the economic conditions in that industry but also the financial condition of our customers in that industry in determining the provision for doubtful accounts 
if conditions deteriorate further in that industry  or any other industry  then an additional provision for doubtful accounts may be required

all subsequent discussion of our revenues  cost of revenues and operating expense line items in this item refer only to continuing operations  all of which are in our data management segment 
revenue our revenue consists of license fees  maintenance fees which includes technical and phone support  and fees for professional services which includes versant consulting  our ibm websphere practice  training and related billable travel expense 
our international sales are made at the foreign currency equivalent of a u 
s 
dollar based price 
an increase or decrease in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more or less expensive  respectively  and  therefore impact our competitiveness in foreign markets 
we intend to maintain our sales and marketing activities outside the united states  which include supporting our subsidiaries  distributors and resellers in europe  japan and other asia pacific countries 
this will require significant management attention and financial resources  and may increase costs and impact margins unless and until corresponding revenue is achieved

geographically  our north american revenues declined and under performed compared with expectations  especially for the two consecutive quarters  ended april  and july  we attribute this outcome more to cautious purchasing behavior in the region rather than a discernable trend away from using versant s technology 
european revenues grew significantly  primarily due to our merger with poet  although revenues from versant s core data management products also grew in this region 
for the last two years  the technology sector has been our largest revenue source 
the incorporation of versant products into the application offerings of independent software vendors isvs such as peoplesoft and borland and increasing sales of the isv s products have increased license revenue in this sector 
examples of these applications are demand consensus forecasts  collaborative planning  and requirements management 
in addition  the growth of the versant websphere professional services practice since its inception in year has increased the amount of our business in the technology sector because of increasing adoption of websphere by technology companies 
the telecommunications industry continues to be a very significant vertical market sector for us 
our products are used in the telecommunications industry in such strategic distributed applications as network modeling and management  fault diagnosis  fraud prevention  service activation and assurance  and customer billing 
defense sector revenue was down in  but we attribute this more to the erratic purchasing behavior and lengthy sales cycles of our defense customers and sub contractors rather than an indication of a meaningful revenue trend 
fiscal compared to fiscal the relative mix of our revenues between license  maintenance and professional services in was more heavily weighted toward professional services revenue and less towards license revenue than in due to the growth in our websphere consulting practice in and the lower license transaction volume in compared with geographically  both our european and asian revenues declined in absolute and relative terms 
we believe that these declines resulted from the economic downturn during this period  which has had a more marked effect on international sales than on domestic sales  particularly in europe  and especially as it applied to the telecommunications industry 
the technology sector was the biggest contributor to the increase in revenues  largely attributable to the growth in our websphere consulting practice revenues 
telecommunications customers represented of total revenues in and continue to be a significant vertical market for versant  although this sector was down compared with and with historical norms for versant  reflecting the ongoing economic challenges in that industry 
defense sector revenue was consistent with in both absolute and percentage terms 
license revenue license revenue represents perpetual license fees received from our end user and value added reseller customers and recognized in our statement of operations in accordance with sop cost of license revenue consists primarily of product royalty obligations incurred by us when we sublicense tools provided by third parties and costs of reselling third party products and secondarily of costs of user manuals  product media  production labor costs  freight and packaging 
percent change in fiscal year twelve months ended october  from from in thousands license revenue cost margin margin fiscal compared to fiscal the net increase in license revenue of approximately  in over was comprised of an approximate million license revenue contribution from poet products  which was primarily generated in europe  offset by an approximate million decrease in versant s core data management license sales 
much of this shortfall was attributable to weakness in the us apac value added reseller var channels in the second and third quarters of resale of third party products was of total license revenue in down considerably from the we experienced in cost of license revenue decreased by approximately  primarily due to approximately  lower cost of resold licenses compared with and offset by approximately  in higher product royalty payments compared to last year 
license margins improved by in  due to the fact that our revenue mix included fewer revenues from lower margin resales of third party products 
fiscal compared to fiscal license revenue in decreased to million from million in  primarily due to lower transaction volume rather than price pressure 
lengthy sales cycles and customers preference for licensing our software on an as needed basis versus the historical practice of prepaying license fees in advance of usage were factors adversely affecting our license revenues  as was the macroeconomic environment  especially as it pertained to the telecommunications industry 
resale of third party products was of total license revenue in with the remainder being primarily sales of versant s core database product  vds 
cost of license revenue decreased in to approximately  compared to approximately  in this net year over year decline of approximately  was primarily due to decreased license sales volume 
license margins remained constant at 
maintenance and technical support maintenance and technical support revenue includes revenue derived from maintenance agreements under which we provide customers with internet and telephone access to support personnel and software upgrades  dedicated technical assistance and emergency response support options 
it also includes maintenance revenue on the resale of third party products 
cost of maintenance and technical support revenue consists principally of personnel costs associated with providing technical support percent change in fiscal year twelve months ended october  from from in thousands maintenance revenue cost margin margin fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in revenue of approximately  in compared with was comprised principally of the addition of poet s maintenance and support contracts that were primarily executed in europe while maintenance revenue from versant s vds customers in remained at levels similar to those of cost of maintenance and technical support revenue increased  primarily as a result of the addition of poet s customer support organization in europe 
maintenance and technical support margins remained unchanged with we exited the year with maintenance and technical support employees worldwide in north america and in europe 
fiscal compared to fiscal maintenance and technical support revenues increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to an increase in maintenance pricing on new license deals  which mitigated the impact of reduced license sales  and also our continued efforts to bring the installed customer base current on their maintenance contracts for customers that were running older versions of our software 
cost of maintenance and technical support revenue increased slightly due to salary cost  though total headcount levels did not change year over year 
maintenance and technical support margins improved slightly  with revenue increases exceeding the nominal increase in expense 
professional services professional services revenue consists of revenue from consulting  training and technical support as well as billable travel expenses incurred by our service organization 
cost of professional services revenue consists principally of personnel costs both employee and sub contractor associated with providing consulting and training 
cost of revenues from professional services may vary depending on whether such services are provided by versant personnel or by typically more expensive sub contracted third party consultants 
percent change in fiscal year twelve months ended october  from from in thousands professional services revenue cost margin margin fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in revenues of approximately  in professional services revenue in compared with was comprised primarily of a decrease in versant s websphere consulting revenue 
this decrease was due to lower utilization rates in this practice  especially in our quarter ended july   as some long term engagements concluded and our consultants transitioned onto new engagements 
websphere consulting represented of total professional services revenue for compared with for cost of professional services revenue decreased in by approximately  due to lower headcount and related costs of approximately  offset by approximately  of increased subcontracted consulting costs as some of our employees transitioned to subcontractor status 
professional services margins decreased in  with revenue reductions outpacing cost decreases 
we exited the year with professional services employees worldwide  comprised of in north america and in europe 
fiscal compared to fiscal professional services revenue increased to million in from million in  with approximately million of the total increase coming from the growth in our websphere practice with the remaining  due to the growth in versant s consulting practice 
websphere consulting represented of total professional services in compared with of the total in cost of professional services revenue increased to million in from million in mainly due to the increased volume of subcontracted consulting resources required to support the increased sale volume 
professional services margins improved by in despite increased usage of subcontracted labor due to higher utilization rates for our professional services 
gross profit margins the key factors that cause variations in our gross profit are sales volume the mix of our product sales  as this directly impacts our total costs of revenue 
in general  a higher proportion of license revenue will result in lower relative total costs of revenue and thus higher gross profit margins 
our maintenance revenues have the next lowest associated costs  with consulting revenues attracting the highest costs

amortization of purchased intangibles in accordance with sfas  we allocate the cost of companies and technology we acquire to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired according to their respective fair values as of the date of completion of the acquisition  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
certain intangible assets  such as acquired technology and customer relationships are amortized to expense over time

we believe that a significant level of research and development expenditures is required to remain competitive and to timely complete products under development 
accordingly  we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development to design  produce and increase the quality  competitiveness and acceptance of our products 
however  if we continue our research and development efforts without corresponding increases in revenue  our results of operations would be adversely affected

some of these employees were employed on a part time basis yielding the equivalent of full time employees worldwide comprised of in north america and in europe 
fiscal compared to fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in primarily due to reduced bad debt expense  a major component of which was the collection of a previously reserved european receivable 
restructuring costs during the second quarter of fiscal  we implemented a restructuring plan aimed at optimizing performance in our catalog business that was acquired as part of the merger with poet 
the primary goal was to reduce operating expenses to more appropriately align them with sustainable revenue levels 
as a result  we incurred costs related to employee severance payments  related benefit and outplacement expenses totaling approximately  that were recorded as restructuring costs in operating expenses during the second and third quarters of fiscal given that our catalog business was acquired in september by ems and ems assumed all assets  liabilities and employees of the catalog business  all obligations under this restructuring plan have been fulfilled as of october  during october we committed to an additional restructuring plan to take the following actions in an effort to reduce operating expenses in our data management business restructuring action restructuring expense recorded in quarter ending october  cash impact amount estimated timing in thousands workforce reduction and separation costs paid in october through february closure of certain european offices and reduction in utilization of leased space for california headquarters  by approximately no cash impact above original lease commitment paid in monthly installments through may write off of leasehold improvements relating to the unutilized portion of the office space mentioned above no cash impact n a total the company took these actions in order to streamline its operations and minimize redundancies in light of its acquisitions of poet holdings  inc  fastobjects  inc and the assets of jdo genie pty ltd during and in general to reduce ongoing operating expenses in an effort to improve operating results and conserve working capital

fiscal in fiscal  non cash stock expense consisted of the following approximately  of stock based expense related to stock options granted to non employee contractors 
approximately million of non cash stock expense related to the acceleration of the vesting of employee owned shares  pursuant to an amendment agreement dated september   entered into with certain of the former stockholders of mokume software  inc the former mokume stockholders 
the amendment agreement amended the agreement and plan of reorganization dated as of november  pursuant to which versant acquired mokume the mokume merger agreement 
pursuant to the mokume merger agreement  versant originally issued  shares of its common stock the mokume shares to the former mokume stockholders 
under the terms of the merger agreement  versant was entitled to repurchase from the former mokume stockholders a total of  of the mokume shares the contingent shares at the price of per share if certain contingencies related to the mokume acquisition did not occur within a defined time period the contingency 
the contingent shares held by certain of the former mokume stockholders were also subject to monthly vesting conditions based on their continued employment with versant over a two year period beginning on november  in addition  all the shares issued to the former mokume stockholders under the mokume merger agreement were subject to potential forfeiture to versant to satisfy claims for indemnification that might be asserted by versant for breaches of mokume s representations and warranties under the merger agreement  subject to certain release conditions 
the principal modifications to the mokume merger agreement effected by the amendment agreement are summarized below 
a total of  of the contingent shares were forfeited by the former mokume stockholders and cancelled without consideration 
the remaining  contingent shares are no longer subject to forfeiture or repurchase by versant and were released from the contingency and any vesting restrictions now applicable to them 
subject to certain conditions  the  remaining mokume shares were to be released from the risk of forfeiture to satisfy claims for indemnification made by versant under the merger agreement in installments over time as follows a  shares were released from potential forfeiture under indemnification claims on september  and b the balance of  shares were to be released in various increments at various times during the one year period beginning on november  and ending november   when all shares not previously forfeited would be released from indemnification claims 
under this formula   shares have been released from potential forfeiture under indemnification claims in various increments at various times through the period ending may   and the amendment agreement also provides former mokume stockholders certain rights to satisfy versant indemnification claims in cash in lieu of forfeiting mokume shares 
all of the remaining  mokume shares are currently being held by versant to potentially satisfy indemnity claims by versant that arose from a lawsuit filed against versant on october  by systems america  inc and mokume  inc 
a different company than that acquired by versant any indemnity shares not forfeited to satisfy the indemnity claim will be disbursed to the former mokume stockholders 
the suit  which seeks unspecified damages and injunctive relief  alleges that former employees of systems america  inc left systems america to form a company named mokume software  inc  and in the process misappropriated systems america s trade secrets and confidential information  unfairly competed with systems america vis vis its customer relationships  and infringed systems america s trademarks and trade names 
the suit further alleges that when versant acquired mokume software inc in november of  versant acquired the benefit of the misappropriated trade secrets  confidential information  customer relationships  and trademarks and trade names 
versant denies the allegations in the litigation and intends to vigorously defend against the complaint

at october   the company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively and federal and state tax credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and federal tax credit carryforwards expire on various dates through  if not utilized 
the state tax credit carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely 
due to the company s history of operating losses  the company believes that there is sufficient uncertainty regarding the realizability of these carryforwards and  therefore  a valuation allowance of approximately million has been recorded against the company s net deferred tax assets of approximately million 
approximately million of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is attributable to employee stock option deductions  the benefit from which will be allocated to additional paid in capital when and if subsequently realized 
the company will continue to assess the realizability of the tax benefit available based on actual and forecasted operating results 
due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of  the availability of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to offset federal taxable income in future periods is subject to an annual limitation due to changes in ownership for income tax purposes 
amortization and write down of goodwill in accordance with sfas no

the principal assets disposed of in the sale of the catalog business to ems include the x solutions and esupplier solutions product lines  including the poet x buy  poet x market  poet x sell  poet esupplier port  poet esupplier web and poet esupplier link products  related rights to those products and customer agreements of the catalog business as well as the transfer of catalog business personnel 
pursuant to the sale agreement  it was also agreed that poet gmbh now owned by ems may use the poet trade name and mark in connection with data processing and software businesses and that versant  its subsidiary poet holdings  inc and their affiliates agreed to cease their use of the poet trade name or mark effective as of january  in addition  pursuant to the sale agreement poet software granted poet gmbh certain non exclusive rights to certain poet database software for use with certain existing poet gmbh customer contracts 
in exchange for the shares of poet gmbh  ems has paid poet software a closing cash payment of  euros and agreed to pay a further  euros for a total of  euros cash consideration or approximately million usd 
in addition  ems has agreed to pay a royalty on future revenues of poet gmbh s catalog business over the ten month period following the signing of the sale agreement in an amount equal to of all poet gmbh s catalog solutions business revenues which a exceed  euros or approximately  usd based on current exchange rates during the period from september  to december   b exceed  euros or approximately  usd based on current exchange rates during the period from january  to march   and c exceed  euros or approximately  usd based on current exchange rates during the period from april  to june  the following tables show the results of the company s discontinued catalog solutions business from march  the effective date of the poet merger through the date of disposition and summarize the components on the company s loss from the sale of the catalog solutions business

of this amount  approximately million was held in us bank accounts and approximately million was held in foreign accounts  principally in europe 
in relation to our cash balances held overseas  there are no european union foreign exchange restrictions on repatriating our overseas held cash to the united states 
however  we may be subject to income tax withholding in the source countries and to us federal and state income taxes if the cash payment or transfer from our subsidiaries to the us parent were to be classified as a dividend 
other payments made by our european overseas subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business eg payment of royalties or interest from the subsidiaries to the us parent are generally not subject to income tax withholding due to tax treaties 
we do not currently have plans to repatriate the cash held in our foreign subsidiaries to the united states 
commitments and contingencies in november  we entered into a ten year operating lease agreement for our corporate headquarters in fremont  california that commenced on june  and expires on may  the terms of the lease provide for certain increases in rental payments during the lease term 
rental expense under this agreement  including contractual rent increases  is recognized on a straight line basis 
we also lease field office space in europe and india  generally under multi year operating lease agreements 
consolidated rent expense for the year ended october   the year ended october  and year ended october   was approximately   and  respectively 
pursuant to a consulting agreement  we have contracted to have some research and development work for a portion of our versant open access product performed for certain periods by jdo genie pty ltd  a south african company from which we acquired core technology used in our versant open access product 
this contract was executed in conjunction with our june  acquisition of the jdo genie technology and expires on the anniversary of the acquisition unless both parties to the contract mutually agree to extend the term of the arrangement 
the contract includes a fixed monthly retainer  milestone payments  objective based bonus payments and a provision for the reimbursement of travel expenses all payable by versant the company s future annual minimum commitments at october  under non cancelable operating leases and the jdo genie consulting contract are listed in the table below 
the company has approximately million of these commitments recorded in the october  balance sheet 
in thousands operating consulting year ending october  leases contract total total commitments cash flow from operating activities our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers following the purchase of our products and services 
our primary uses of cash in operating activities are for personnel related expenditures and facilities costs 
with our october restructuring action and the disposition of the catalog business we re forecasting our cash expenses in our income statement for ie excluding depreciation and amortization of intangible assets to be consistent with levels we operated at prior to the merger with poet 
we do expect some revenue growth in and believe that  together with our projected expense reductions  this gives us a realistic opportunity of operating at a cash flow breakeven position or better for in the approximate million use of cash in operating activities was comprised of an approximate million net outflow of cash in our data management business made up of approximately million of cash expense  mainly employee related  an increase of million over cash expenses paid in operating activities in  primarily due to the addition of poet s employee base from march   plus approximately  of restructuring expense paid in  offset by approximately million in collections from our customers which was down from despite higher revenue levels for the following reasons our collections performance in was not as good as in mainly due to the higher proportion of european receivables in versus attributable to higher revenue levels in europe and which typically take longer to collect than domestic receivables and  secondarily  the effect of ibm changing its payment terms to all its vendors from days to days impacted us more in than in a decrease in deferred revenue in versant s core business due to reduced demand for premium support services eg x support and certain of our enterprise customers moving to a time and material model for support  both factors  we believe  being a function of product stability on deployed customer applications rather than an indicator of customer defection to competitive technologies 
another factor in the deferred revenue decrease is the weak license revenue performance in the north american geography in the three months ended april  and july  versant s deferred revenue balance in total declined by million year over year however the deferred revenue brought to the company by the poet and fastobjects inc acquisitions has partially offset the decline in our deferred revenues attributable to our core business  a trend we see continuing next year and to a larger extent 
given that maintenance support services are paid in arrears for fastobjects product deployments compared with in advance for all other versant products we expect near term cash flows will continue to be impacted until we fully transition to this new model 
an approximate million net outflow of cash from operations in our catalog business incurred from march  through to the sale of this business in september 
in the million use of cash in operating activities was comprised of approximately million of cash expense  mainly employee related and approximately  legal and investment banking fees attributable to our merger with poet  offset by approximately million in collections from our customers cash flow from investing activities in the past  our primary uses of cash in investing activities are typically for purchases of property and equipment typically it related equipment 
to a much smaller extent  our sources of cash from investing activities are proceeds from the sale of property and equipment 
however  over the past two years and we have made a number of acquisitions mokume  poet  fastobjects  inc and the jdo genie technology and have incurred significant costs in effecting these acquisitions as well as acquiring the cash balances of the acquired companies in the case of poet holdings and fastobjects inc  all of which are reflected in this section of the cash flow statement 
additionally  in  we also sold our catalog business for cash  the proceeds from which are reflected in investing activities 
we re forecasting moderate levels of capital expenditure in  mainly in the it systems arena 
we expect that some infrastructure may need to be added improved as a result of sox implementation 
in net cash provided by investing activities was approximately million  comprised of approximately million of cash inflows from the acquisition of poet net of transaction costs and the sale of our catalog business  offset by approximately  of investing outflows representing the net acquisition costs of fastobjects inc and the jdo genie technology in and approximately  of purchases of property and equipment in net cash used in investing activities was approximately  comprised of approximately  of acquisition costs for mokume software  inc  and approximately  of purchases of property and equipment cash flows from financing activities our existing asset based credit line for million with pacific business funding expired on september  and we elected not to renew the facility at that time due to our very low historic usage of this credit line 
we intend evaluating similar facilities  possibly with other banks  during the last time we borrowed under our line with pacific business funding was in october in the amount of  and this amount was repaid within a month 
our primary uses of cash in financing activities were typically for repayments under our receivables line that  as we mentioned above  expired in september our usual sources of cash from financing activities are proceeds from the sale of common stock under our employee stock option and stock purchase plans and  in the periods that we had a receivable line in place  periodic draw downs on the credit line that were typically repaid within a month 
our publicly traded stock is an important potential source of financing for us as follows employee stock option and stock purchase plans we ve taken a conservative approach in our forecast regarding financing inflows from exercises of employee stock options or share purchases under our employee stock purchase plan espp as our stock has been trading under per share for the past few months and many of our employee options now have exercise prices significantly in excess of the current bid price of our stock 
however  should our stock price rise above current levels  employees will be likely to exercise more options than in the recent past and enrollment in the espp may increase  thereby potentially generating extra cash flow for the company 
acquisitions or long term financing opportunities in the case of acquisitions we have used our stock as currency in effecting purchases of other companies or technologies  poet being the most significant example as this acquisition brought significant cash resources to the company reported under investing activities 
another source of longer term financing could be a private offering of stock or other equity securities of versant  although we are not actively working on anything in this realm 
for the avenue of either acquisition or long term financing to be viable it is important that our stock remains traded on nasdaq 
we have received notification from nasdaq that our bid price has traded below the minimum per share bid price level for some time and have been given a grace period to rectify this or potentially have our common stock delisted off the nasdaq smallcap market 
please see risk factors risks related to our stock in order for our common stock to continue to be listed on the nasdaq smallcap market  we must satisfy the nasdaq smallcap listing requirements  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so below 
however we believe that there is a good chance that we will be able to again come into compliance with the nasdaq listing requirements through operational means  although if this is not the case we would likely need to consider effecting a reverse split of our common stock to achieve compliance with this listing requirement 
in  uses of cash in financing activities were almost completely matched by cash provided by financing activities as follows  in outflows due to repayment of the amount drawn down on the receivables line in october  offset by approximately  in inflows consisting of proceeds from the sale of common stock under our employee stock option and stock purchase plans 
in  approximately  of cash was provided by financing activities as follows  in inflows due to a draw down on our receivables line of credit in october  and approximately  in inflows consisting of proceeds from the sale of common stock under our employee stock option and stock purchase plans 
although we expect to effectively manage our cash resources  there can be no assurance that our cash resources will be adequate  if our financial results fall short of our goals  as our operating results are very difficult to predict and we are dependent upon future events  including our ability to successfully negotiate a new revolving credit line or obtain additional debt or equity financing 
additional debt or equity financing may be required or desirable  although it is not currently anticipated  and may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
the prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase our securities may be lower than the market value or trading price of our common stock  which has recently decreased 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our shareholders  which could be substantial and may involve the issuance of preferred securities that would have liquidation preferences that entitle holders of the preferred securities to receive certain amounts before holders of common stock in connection with an acquisition or business combination involving versant or a liquidation of versant 
new investors may also seek agreements giving them additional voting control or seats on our board of directors 
even if we were able to obtain additional debt or equity financing  the terms of this financing might significantly restrict our business activities and in some circumstances  might require us to obtain the approval of our shareholders  which could delay or prevent consummation of the financing transaction 
cash may also be needed to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies and we expect that  in the event of such an acquisition or investment  if significant  it will be necessary for us to seek additional debt or equity financing 
risk factors this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements regarding the company that involve risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those set forth below  that could cause our actual results of operations to differ materially from those contemplated in the forward looking statements 
the matters set forth below should be carefully considered when evaluating our business and prospects 
risks related to our business we are dependent on a limited number of products 
nearly all of our license revenue to date has been derived from vds 
consequently  if our ability to generate revenue from vds were negatively impacted  our business  cash flows and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
many factors could negatively impact our ability to generate revenue from vds  including without limitation slowness in the general economy or in key industries we serve  such as the telecommunications and financial services industries  the success of competitive products of other vendors  reduction in the prices we can obtain for our products due to competitive factors  the adoption of new technologies or standards that make either product technologically obsolete or customer reluctance to invest in object oriented technologies 
although we have taken steps to diversify our product line through our acquisition of poet and its fastobjects data management product our recent introduction of our open access jdo product  we still expect that sales of vds will continue to be critical to our revenues for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  any significant reduction in revenue levels from our vds products can be expected to have a strong negative impact on our business and results of operation 
our revenue levels are not predictable 
our revenue has fluctuated dramatically on a quarterly basis  and we expect this trend to continue 
for example  in fiscal our quarterly revenue fluctuated from a high of million in the first quarter of fiscal to a low of million in the second quarter of fiscal these quarterly fluctuations result from a number of factors  including delays by our customers including customers who are resellers in signing revenue bearing contracts that were expected to be entered into in a particular fiscal quarter  general macroeconomic factors that impact information technology  or it  capital purchasing decisions  the lengthy sales cycle associated with our products  customer and market perceptions of the value and currency of object oriented software technology  uncertainty regarding the timing and scope of customer deployment schedules of applications based on vds where revenue is contingent upon the customer s deployment of our product  failure to timely develop and launch successful new products  fluctuations in domestic and foreign demand for our products and services  particularly in the telecommunications  technology  and defense markets the impact of new product introductions  both by us and by our competitors  our unwillingness to lower prices significantly to meet prices set by our competitors or reductions of our prices to meet competition  the effect of publications of opinions about us and our competitors and their products  customer deferrals of orders in anticipation of product enhancements or new product offerings by us or our competitors  and potential customers unwillingness to invest in our products given our perceived financial instability 
we may not be able to manage costs effectively given the unpredictability of our revenue 
we expect to continue to maintain a relatively high level of fixed expenses  including expenses related to poet s operations 
if planned revenue growth  including revenue from poet s products  does not materialize  then our business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially harmed 
our customer concentration increases the potential volatility of our operating results 
a significant portion of our total revenue has been  and we believe will continue to be  derived from a limited number of orders placed by large organizations 
for example  one customer  ibm who subcontracts for us on websphere consulting engagements  represented of our total revenue in fiscal and in fiscal the timing of large orders and of their fulfillment has caused  and in the future is likely to cause  material fluctuations in our operating results  particularly on a quarterly basis 
in addition  our major customers tend to change from year to year 
the loss of any one or more of our major customers  or our inability to replace a customer making declining purchases with a new customer of comparable significance  could each have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have limited working capital and may experience difficulty in obtaining needed funding  which may limit our ability to effectively pursue our business strategies 
at october   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and working capital of approximately million 
we have experienced significant declines in our cash and working capital in fiscal to date  we have not achieved profitability or positive cash flow on a sustained basis 
in response to this situation  in the fourth quarter of fiscal we restructured our business operations to reduce our operating expenses 
although with this restructuring we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  and any net cash provided by operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for the next twelve months  it is possible that events may occur that could render our current working capital reserves insufficient 
because our revenue is unpredictable and a significant portion of our expenses are fixed  a reduction in our projected revenue or unanticipated requirements for cash outlays could deplete our limited financial resources 
for example  our acquisition of poet and its operations may increase certain of our operating expenses even after our fiscal restructuring  and if revenues from poet s product line don t materialize when anticipated our working capital could be adversely impacted 
impairment of our working capital would require us to make expense reductions and or to raise funds through borrowing or debt or equity financing 
our bank line of credit expired in september and there can be no assurance that we will secure a new bank line of credit 
likewise  there can be no assurance that any equity or debt funding will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
if we cannot secure adequate financing sources  then we would be required to further reduce our operating expenses  which would restrict our ability to pursue our business objectives 
reduced demand for our products and services may prevent us from achieving targeted revenue and profitability 
our revenue and our ability to achieve and sustain profitability depend on the overall demand for the software products and services we offer 
reduced demand for our product line may result from competition offered by alternative technologies or negative customer perception of our object oriented technology 
general economic conditions can also have a significant adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
the slowdown in the world economy that began in the early s caused many of our customer or potential customer to experience declines in their revenues and results of operations 
this in turn caused potential or existing customers to defer purchases of capital equipment  particularly for critical it infrastructure  which is the market sector we serve the current war in iraq and generally uncertain world conditions and concerns about terrorism also have increased the current uncertainty in the economic environment  and we cannot predict the impact of these or similar events in the future  or of any related or unrelated military action  on our customers or our business 
we believe that  in light of these concerns  some businesses may continue to curtail or eliminate capital spending on information technology 
in addition  we have experienced continued hesitancy on the part of our existing and potential customers to commit to new products or services from us 
further  prior to our merger with poet in march of  poet s ability to forecast the timing and amount of its sales had been substantially reduced by the economic slowdown  and poet had experienced lengthened sales cycles  lower average selling prices and reduced bookings and revenues 
if us or global economic conditions worsen  this revenue impact may worsen as well and have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we rely for revenue on the technology  telecommunications and defense which are characterized by complexity and intense competition 
historically  we have been highly dependent upon the telecommunications industry and  more recently  we are becoming increasingly dependent upon the technology and defense industries for sales of vds 
our success in these areas is dependent  to a large extent  on general economic conditions  our ability to compete with alternative technology providers our ability to develop products that can successfully operate in different computing environments and whether our customers and potential customers believe we have the expertise and financial stability necessary to provide effective solutions in these markets on an ongoing basis 
if these conditions  among others  are not satisfied  we may not be successful in generating additional opportunities in these markets 
currently  companies in these markets are scaling back their technology expenditures and the telecommunications industry has in particular experienced significant economic difficulties and consolidation trends which could jeopardize our ability to continue to derive revenue from customers in that industry 
in addition  the types of applications and commercial products for the technology  telecommunications and defense markets are continuing to develop and are rapidly changing  and these markets are characterized by an increasing number of new entrants whose products may compete with ours 
as a result  we cannot predict the future growth of or whether there will be future growth in these markets  and demand for object oriented databases applications in these markets may not develop or be sustainable 
we also may not be successful in attaining a significant share of these markets due to competition and other factors  such as our limited working capital 
moreover  potential customers in these markets generally develop sophisticated and complex applications that require substantial consulting expertise to implement and optimize 
this requires that we maintain a highly skilled consulting practice with specific expertise in these markets 
there can be no assurance that we can hire and retain adequate personnel for this practice 
we increasingly depend on our international operations 
a large and increasing portion of our revenue is derived from customers located outside north america 
for the fiscal year ended october   international revenue made up approximately of our total revenue  while for the year ended october   approximately of our total revenue was derived from customers outside the united states and canada 
following our acquisition of poet  we expect that international revenue will represent a larger percentage of our total revenue than it has historically 
consequently we must conduct our operations internationally and maintain a significant presence in international markets 
as a result of our acquisition of poet we now have approximately employees based in europe 
in addition  we also perform a significant amount of engineering work in india through our wholly owned subsidiary located in pune  india 
in fiscal  we transitioned some of our international sales efforts to a business model that employs local distributors 
while use of local distributors reduces certain sales and operating expenses  it also makes our business more dependent on the skills and efforts of third parties and can decrease our profit margins 
our international operations are subject to a number of risks in addition to the risks faced by our domestic operations 
these risks include  but are not limited to longer receivable collection periods  adverse changes in regulatory requirements  dependence on independent resellers  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  compliance with multiple and conflicting regulations and technology standards in different jurisdictions  import and export restrictions  tariffs and other regulatory restrictions  difficulties in  and increased costs of  staffing and managing foreign operations  potentially adverse tax consequences arising from international operations and inter company transactions  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  the impact of business cycles  economic and political instability and potential hostilities outside the united states  and limited ability to enforce agreements  intellectual property rights and other rights in some foreign countries 
in addition  in light of increasing global security and terrorism  there may be additional risks of disruption to our international sales activities 
any prolonged disruption in markets in which we derive significant revenue may potentially have a material adverse impact on our revenues and results of operations 
our personnel  management team and operations are located in different countries and as a result  we may experience difficulty in coordinating our activities and successfully implementing company goals 
following our merger with poet  we acquired significant operations and personnel in europe  whose activities must be well coordinated with those of our us workforce and other employees 
following the poet merger  our management team resides in both our us headquarters in fremont  california and our offices in hamburg  germany 
the fairly large geographic dispersion of our management team and our workforce may make it more difficult for us to successfully manage longer term objectives  coordinate activity across the company and integrate our operations and business plans 
our products have a lengthy sales cycle 
the sales cycle for our vds and fastobjects products varies substantially from customer to customer  and often exceeds nine months and can sometimes extend to a year or more  especially for sales to defense sector customers 
sales to our versant open access customers are often concluded in shorter time intervals 
due in part to the strategic nature of our products and associated expenditures  potential customers are typically cautious in making product acquisition decisions 
influencing our customers decision to license our products generally requires that we provide a significant level of education to prospective customers regarding the uses and benefits of our products  and that we frequently commit  without any charge or reimbursement  pre sales support resources  such as assistance in performing benchmarking and application prototype development 
because of the lengthy sales cycle for our products and the relatively large average dollar size of individual licenses  a lost or delayed sale could have a significant impact on our operating results for a particular fiscal period 
we are subject to litigation and the risk of future litigation 
we and certain of our present and former officers and directors were named as defendants in four class action lawsuits filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california in the complaint alleged violations of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  or exchange act  and securities and exchange commission rule b promulgated under the exchange act  in connection with public statements about versant and its financial performance 
although this case has been dismissed as of this date  there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to similar litigation in the future 
in addition  in the last quarter of fiscal we were served with a complaint filed by systems america  inc  a privately held company  which alleges that  prior to our acquisition of mokume software  inc in november  persons associated with mokume misappropriated systems america s trade secrets and confidential information  unfairly competed with systems america with respect to its customer relationships  and infringed systems america s trademarks and trade names 
the complaint seeks unspecified damages and injunctive relief against the company and mokume s former personnel 
we do not believe this complaint has merit or that this litigation is material 
we deny the allegations in the complaint and intend to vigorously defend against the complaint 
however  even if we prevail  litigation can be expensive to defend  can consume significant amounts of management time and could result in an adverse judgment or settlement that could have adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition 
in order to be successful  versant must attract  retain and motivate key employees and failure to do so could seriously harm the company 
in order to be successful  versant must attract  retain and motivate its executives and other key employees  including those in managerial  sales and technical positions and those who became our employees as a result of our merger with poet holdings 
in recent months our stock price has declined and we reduced our workforce in connection with a restructuring of our operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal these and other circumstances may adversely affect versant s ability to attract and retain key management  sales and technical personnel who are critical to the success of our operations 
versant must continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on the achievement of our strategies and goals 
in addition  as a result of our merger with poet in march of  versant now employs a sizable german workforce subject to german law  which generally provides greater financial protection to terminated employees than does united states law 
consequently  failure to retain our german employees may cause us to incur significant severance costs  which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
we will incur increased costs as a result of recently enacted laws and regulations relating to corporate governance matters and public disclosure 
recently enacted and proposed changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies  including the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of  rules adopted or proposed by the sec and by the nasdaq national market and new accounting pronouncements will result in increased costs to us as we evaluate the implications of these laws  regulations and standards and respond to their requirements 
to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure  we intend to invest substantial resources to comply with evolving standards 
this investment will result in increased general and administrative expenses within fiscal year and a diversion of management time and attention from strategic revenue generating and cost management activities 
in addition  these new laws and regulations could make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance  including director and officer liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors  on our board committees or as executive officers 
we are taking steps to comply with the recently enacted laws and regulations in accordance with the deadlines  by which compliance is required  but we cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs that we may incur to respond to their requirement and cannot be certain that we will be able to fully comply with the provisions of section of the sarbanes oxley act regarding compliance with certain assessments and auditor attestations regarding internal control structure reporting 
although we expect that our merger with poet will ultimately result in benefits to us  we may not realize those benefits because of integration difficulties and other challenges 
following our merger with poet holdings in march of we have been continually engaged in ongoing efforts to successfully integrate the operations of the two companies 
however  much integration work still remains to be done and any failure to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating the operations of versant and poet or to realize any of the anticipated benefits or synergies of the merger could seriously harm our results 
integration efforts absorb significant amounts of senior management s time 
realizing the benefits of the merger will depend in part on the ability of the combined company to continue to overcome significant challenges  such as timely  efficient and successful execution of post merger strategies  including combining the day to day operations of the two companies  making successful strategic decisions with respect to versant s and poet s product lines  integrating and managing the operations of the combined company across multiple distant geographic locations  including updating and extending management controls  reporting systems and procedures on a timely basis  retaining and assimilating the key personnel of each company  integrating the technology and products of the two companies and their marketing strategies  retaining existing customers and strategic partners of both companies and attracting new customers and strategic partners  and successfully exploiting potential synergies of the two companies 
the risks related to the execution of these post merger strategies include potential disruption of the combined company s ongoing business  distraction of senior management resulting from the efforts to combine and integrate versant s and poet s operations  difficulty in successfully coordinating the management of the combined company  including difficulties arising from the fact that the combined company s management team is dispersed between offices in fremont  california and hamburg  germany  difficulties inherent in creating successful strategies for coordinating sales and marketing plans for the combined company s products and services  changes in strategic directions that may adversely affect near term and long term revenues  the risk that synergies anticipated for the combined company s products will not be achieved or may not be realized within the time frame currently anticipated  the possibility that efforts to achieve operating expense reductions may be unsuccessful or give rise to unexpected liabilities  the potential need to demonstrate to customers that the merger will not result in adverse changes in customer service standards or business  impairment of relationships with employees  suppliers and customers as a result of the integration of new management personnel  and failure to retain key employees  including members of the management team  of the combined company 
until march   versant cannot take certain actions without the approval of at least of versant s directors then in office 
upon consummation of our merger with poet  versant s articles of incorporation were amended to provide that  for a period of months immediately after the effective time of the merger  certain actions  including any proposed acquisition of versant  any sale of any product line  any material change in operation of versant s business or any change in the authorized number of versant s directors  will require the approval of at least of the members of versant s board of directors then in office 
since versant s board is now comprised of three directors who were members of versant s board immediately prior to the merger and two directors who were members of poet s board immediately prior to the merger  approval of these transactions will effectively require the unanimous vote of all directors 
the board members may have different views on which transactions are beneficial to versant and its shareholders 
failure to obtain this required approval may cause versant to lose opportunities that could be favorable to it and its shareholders 
charges to earnings resulting from the application of the purchase method of accounting for the merger with poet may adversely affect the market value of versant s common stock 
in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  versant accounts for the merger with poet using the purchase method of accounting  which results in charges to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on the market value of versant common stock 
under the purchase method of accounting  versant has allocated the total estimated purchase price to of poet to net tangible assets and amortizable intangible assets based on their fair values as of the date of the closing of the merger  and recorded the excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill 
versant will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in connection with the merger 
which will extend into future fiscal years 
in addition  to the extent the value of goodwill or intangible assets becomes impaired  versant may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets 
these depreciation  amortization  and potential impairment charges could have a material impact on versant s results of operations 
risks related to our industry our products face significant competition 
for our vds and fastobjects products  we compete with companies offering other database management systems 
we face competition from traditional relational database management companies who are substantial competitors including oracle  computer associates  sybase  ibm and microsoft 
we also face competition from object database companies including object design which was acquired by progress software corporation in and objectivity  inc additionally  some prospective customers attempt to build specialized data storage capability themselves using their own internal engineering resources  sometimes starting with low level operating system functionality  and other times utilizing lower level data storage routines that are commercially available  such as berkeley db  a simplified database without query processing capability 
for versant open access  competitors include other object relational mapping products such as hibernate  toplink  other suppliers of products using the jdo standard  such as solarmetric  and a variety of small vendors offering a variety of technical approaches 
many of our competitors  and especially oracle and computer associates  have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  service and other resources  significantly greater name recognition  broader suites of product offerings  stronger sales and distribution channels and a much larger installed base of customers than ours 
in addition  many of our competitors have well established relationships with our current and potential customers 
our competitors may be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products and also may have more direct access to corporate decision makers of key customers based on previous relationships our competitors may also be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements and may be able to obtain sales of products competitive to ours through package sales of a suite of products we do not offer or compete with 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors  and competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we depend on successful technology development 
we believe that significant research and development expenditures will continue to be necessary for us to remain competitive 
while we believe our research and development expenditures will improve our product lines  because of the uncertainty of software development projects  these expenditures will not necessarily result in successful product introductions 
uncertainties affecting the success of software development project introductions include technical difficulties  delays in introductions of new products  market conditions  competitive products and consumer acceptance of new products and operating systems 
we also face certain challenges in integrating third party technology with our products 
these challenges include the technological challenges of integration  which may result in development delays  and uncertainty regarding the economic terms of our relationship with the third party technology providers  which may result in delays of the commercial release of new products 
we expect that evolving industry standards will affect our business 
for example  the ejb standard jsr for data storage in the java enterprise edition will offer risks and opportunities for versant 
the principal risk is that this technology may stimulate the creation of a broader range of competitors  some of whom will offer applications bundled with application servers 
the opportunity is that we expect a very large number of applications to be built with programming interfaces that can readily use versant products to gain performance and other advantages 
in the 
net market  microsoft has experimented with an object relational tool  code named objectspaces  but has withdrawn the tool saying any offering would be beyond the release of their product  code named longhorn 
we must protect our intellectual property 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products  obtain or use information that we regard as proprietary or use or make copies of our products in violation of license agreements 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and potentially expensive 
in addition  the laws of many jurisdictions do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
shrink wrap licenses may be wholly or partially unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions  and copyright and trade secret protection for software may be unavailable in certain foreign countries 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate  and our competitors may independently develop similar technology 
we may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement 
we expect that developers of object oriented technology will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products  competitors and patents in our industry sector grows 
for example  in the last quarter of fiscal we were served with a complaint filed by systems america  inc alleging that we received misappropriated intellectual property from mokume software  inc when we acquired mokume in november and that mokume had interfered with certain business relationship of systems america 
we believe these claims lack merit and intend to defend them vigorously if they are pursued 
however  any claim of this type  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays and require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
if any of our products or technologies were found to infringe third party rights  royalty or licensing agreements to use such third party rights might not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
we depend on our personnel  for whom competition is intense 
our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our key technical  sales and senior management personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract  train and motivate highly qualified technical  sales and managerial personnel 
our current financial position and recent declines in our stock price may make it more difficult to attract and retain highly talented individuals due to constraints on our ability to offer compensation at levels that may be offered by larger competitors 
risks related to our stock our common stock is listed on the nasdaq smallcap market 
we do not currently meet the listing requirements necessary for our common stock to be listed on the nasdaq national market system nms 
effective october   we transferred the listing of our common stock from the nms to the nasdaq smallcap market 
the listing of our common stock on the nasdaq smallcap market may be perceived as a negative by investors and may adversely affect the liquidity and trading price of our common stock 
we may be unable to re list our common stock on the nms 
in order for our common stock to continue to be listed on the nasdaq smallcap market  we must satisfy the nasdaq smallcap listing requirements  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
although the continued listing requirements of the nasdaq smallcap market are not as demanding as those of the nms  they do  among other things  require that our stock have a minimum bid price of per share  which we sometimes refer to below as the minimum price requirement  and that either i we have shareholders equity of  or ii we have  in net income or iii the market value of our publicly held shares be million or more 
as reported in our september  report on form k  on september   we received notification from the nasdaq stock market that  because our common stock had traded at a price below per share for thirty consecutive trading days  we must regain compliance with the minimum price requirement to avoid delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq smallcap market 
to regain compliance with this continued listing requirement  our common stock must have a or greater minimum bid price for a minimum of least ten consecutive trading days  or possibly longer as may be required by nasdaq pursuant to its marketplace rules 
under nasdaq s current marketplace rules  we have been provided a grace period until march  to achieve compliance with the minimum price requirement 
if we have not regained compliance with this requirement by march   then we will potentially be eligible for further grace periods which could extend beyond six months depending upon our ability to meet nasdaq smallcap market initial listing requirement  an important element of which is meeting a minimum net shareholders equity requirement of million 
our net shareholders equity at october  was approximately million 
if we experience difficulty in regaining compliance with the minimum price requirement  we may need to consider adoption of a reverse stock split to obtain compliance 
due to these circumstances  there exists a significant risk that our common stock could cease to qualify for listing on the nasdaq smallcap market 
if our common stock is delisted from trading on the nasdaq smallcap market  then the trading market for our common stock  and the ability of our shareholders to trade our shares and obtain liquidity and fair market prices for their versant shares are likely to be significantly impaired and the market price of versant s common stock may decline significantly 
we may engage in future acquisitions that dilute our shareholders and cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities 
as part of our strategy  we expect to review opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that would complement our current products  expand the breadth of our markets or enhance technical capabilities  or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities 
in the event of any future acquisitions  we could pay amounts of cash to acquire assets or businesses  issue stock that would dilute current shareholders percentage ownership  incur debt  or assume liabilities 
such acquisitions also involve numerous risks  including problems combining the acquired operations  technologies or products or integration of new personnel  the incurrence of unanticipated costs in completing such acquisitions or in inheriting unforeseen liabilities and expenses of acquired businesses  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees of purchased organizations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired businesses  products or technologies that we might purchase in the future 
our stock price is volatile 
our revenue  operating results and stock price have been and may continue to be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
we have previously experienced revenue and earnings results that were significantly below levels expected by securities analysts and investors  which have had an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 
this may occur again in the future 
additionally  as a significant portion of our revenue often occurs late in the quarter  we may not learn of revenue shortfalls until late in the quarter  which  when announced  could result in an even more immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 
we may desire or need to raise additional funds through debt or equity financings  which would dilute the ownership of our existing shareholders and possibly subordinate certain of their rights to rights of new investors 
we may choose to raise additional funds in debt or equity financings if they are available to us on terms we believe reasonable to increase our working capital  strengthen our financial position or to make acquisitions 
any sales of additional equity or convertible debt securities would result in dilution of the equity interests of our existing shareholders  which could be substantial 
additionally  if we issue shares of preferred stock or convertible debt to raise funds  the holders of those securities might be entitled to various preferential rights over the holders of our common stock  including repayment of their investment  and possibly additional amounts  before any payments could be made to holders of our common stock in connection with an acquisition of the company 
such preferred shares  if authorized  might be granted rights and preferences that would be senior to  or otherwise adversely affect  the rights and the value of versant s common stock 
also  new investors may require that we enter into voting arrangements that give them additional voting control or representation on our board of directors 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency hedging instruments 
we transact business in various foreign currencies and  accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
to date  the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on revenue and operating expenses has not been material 
operating expenses incurred by our foreign subsidiaries are denominated primarily in local currencies 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge these operating expenses 
we intend to assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 
in addition  a substantial portion of our cash balances is held in foreign financial institutions and is subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
interest rate risk 
our cash equivalents primarily consist of money market accounts  accordingly  our interest rate risk is de minimus
