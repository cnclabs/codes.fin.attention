risks and uncertainties executive overview with the conclusion of  we wrapped up an month turnaround plan on schedule while continuing to increase our cash and short term investment position 
for the year  we grew revenue by  achieving net sales of nearly million and earnings per diluted share of as the result of a robust direct business and strong sell through in our retail business 
we believe we will generate double digit revenue and earnings growth for the next three years as we press forward to become the global leader in health and fitness 
the business results we are achieving are a direct outcome of our commitment to our fit operating principals financial rigor  innovation  trust  and putting ourselves on a path to become the leader in every category where we compete 
we have made substantial progress positioning our company for growth 
we have four of the strongest brands in fitness today with nautilus and bowflex leading the way followed by schwinn fitness and stairmaster 
we have momentum through new product innovation  which accounted for approximately of our revenue in  compared to about in we believe we are the only health and fitness company positioned across all channels of distribution  providing us an opportunity to leverage innovations and brands with consumers wherever they shop 
we believe was the year of the turnaround  not just to get our company back on a growth track but to position our organization to become the global leader in health and fitness over the long term 
this required a sequenced  multi faceted business plan 
it included new leadership  new strategies  integrating past acquisitions  renewing our commitment to quality  entering new categories  forging customer relationships and investing in innovation 
all of these steps have positioned us for  the first year of our new three year growth plan 
the growth plan involves further increased investment in research and development  continuing the consolidation of our management information systems  investing in brand marketing and finally defending our intellectual property 
critical accounting policies this md a is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when products are shipped and we have no significant remaining obligations  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured or probable  and title and risk of loss have passed 
revenue is recognized net of applicable promotional discounts  rebates  and return allowances 
in addition  revenue is recognized upon final installation for the nautilus commercial equipment if we are responsible for installation 
return allowances  which reduce product revenue by our best estimate of expected product returns  are estimated using historical experience 
in addition  from time to time  we arrange for leases or other financing sources to enable certain of our commercial customers to purchase our equipment 
in the event that a guarantee of the commercial customer s lease obligation is made  we record a liability and corresponding reduction of revenue for the estimated fair value of the guarantee and then recognize revenue over the life of the lease obligation 
stock based compensation we measure compensation expense for our stock based employee compensation plans using the method prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we provide pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the method prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  had been applied in measuring compensation expense 
a change to recognize compensation expense for all options granted using a fair value approach  which will be required starting in july under sfas no 
r  share based payment  will have a significant impact on our results of operations 
warranty reserves accrued warranty expense includes the cost to manufacture raw materials  labor and overhead or purchase warranty parts from our suppliers as well as the cost to ship those parts to our customers 
the cost of labor to install a warranted part on our manufactured commercial equipment is also included 
the warranty reserve is based on our historical experience with each product 
a warranty reserve is established for new products based on historical experience with similar products  adjusted for any technological advances in manufacturing or materials used 
we track warranty claims by part and reason for claim in order to identify any potential warranty trends 
the warranty trends are evaluated periodically with respect to future claims volume and nature of likely claims 
adjustments  if any are so indicated  are made to the warranty reserve to reflect our judgment regarding the likely effect of the warranty trends on future claims 
if we were to experience a significant volume of warranty claims for a particular part or for a particular reason  we may need to make design changes to our product 
if we believed it was necessary to implement those design changes to our installed base of products  our warranty costs could change materially 
a change in warranty experience could have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
legal reserves we are involved in various claims  lawsuits and other proceedings from time to time 
such litigation involves uncertainty as to possible losses we may ultimately realize when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
we accrue and charge to income estimated losses from contingencies when it is probable at the balance sheet date that an asset has been impaired or liability incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
differences between estimates recorded and actual amounts determined in subsequent periods are treated as changes in accounting estimates ie  they are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are determined to 
table of contents be losses  with no retroactive restatement 
the company estimates the probability of losses on legal contingencies based on the advice of internal and external counsel  the outcomes from similar litigation  the status of the lawsuits including settlement initiatives  legislative developments  and other factors 
due to the numerous variables associated with these judgments and assumptions  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates of the related loss contingencies are subject to substantial uncertainties 
we regularly monitor our estimated exposure to these contingencies and  as additional information becomes known  may change our estimates significantly 
a significant change in our estimates  or a result that materially differs from our estimates  could have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
sales return reserves the sales return reserve is maintained based on our historical experience of direct marketed product return rates during the period in which a customer can return a product for refund of the full purchase price  less shipping and handling in certain instances 
the return periods for direct marketed product lines range from days to six weeks depending on the specific product 
we track product returns in order to identify any potential negative customer satisfaction trends 
our return reserve may be sensitive to a change in our customers ability to pay during the trial period due to unforeseen economic circumstances and to different product introductions that might fulfill the customers needs at a perceived better value 
in our commercial retail segment we also provide for estimated sales returns from customers as reductions to revenues and accounts receivable 
the estimates are based on historical rates of product returns 
actual returns in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from the estimates 
any major change in the aforementioned factors may increase sales returns  which could have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level based on our historical experience adjusted for any known uncollectible amounts 
we periodically review the creditworthiness of our customers to help gauge collectibility 
our allowance is sensitive to changes in our customers ability to pay due to unforeseen changes in the economy  including the bankruptcy of a major customer  our efforts to actively pursue collections  and increases in chargebacks 
any major change in the aforementioned factors may result in increasing the allowance for doubtful accounts  which could have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
inventory valuation our inventory is valued at the lower of cost standard or average  depending on location or market 
inventory adjustments are applied for any known obsolete or defective products 
we periodically review inventory levels of our product lines in conjunction with market trends to assess salability of our products 
our assessment of necessary adjustments to market value of inventory is sensitive to changes in fitness technology and competitor product offerings driven by customer demand 
any major change in the aforementioned factors may result in reductions to market value of inventory below cost  which could have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
intangible asset valuation currently  intangible assets consist predominantly of the nautilus  schwinn  and stairmaster trademarks and goodwill associated with the acquisition of schwinn fitness 
management estimates affecting these trademark and goodwill valuations include determination of useful lives and estimates of future cash flows and fair values to perform an impairment analysis on an annual basis or more frequently if additional circumstances arise 
the useful lives assigned by management to the nautilus  schwinn  and stairmaster trademarks are indefinite  years  and indefinite  respectively 
any major change in the useful lives and or the determination of an impairment associated with the valuation of the aforementioned intangible assets may result in asset value write downs  which could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period or periods in which the asset write down is recorded 

table of contents income tax provision income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
inherent in the measurement of these deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of existing tax law and other published guidance as applied to our operations 
when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
no valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets  since we anticipate the full amount of these assets should be realized in the future 
accordingly  if the company s facts or financial results were to change thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to determine changes to the amount of the valuation allowance required to be in place on the financial statements in any given period 
as a matter of course  the company may be audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
we provide reserves for potential exposures when we consider it probable that a taxing authority may take a sustainable position on a matter contrary to our position 
we evaluate these reserves  including interest thereon  on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events that may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures 
management believes that an appropriate liability has been established for estimated exposures  however  actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
to the extent the audits or other events result in a material adjustment to the accrued estimates  the effect would be recognized in income tax expense benefit in the consolidated statement of income in the period of the event 
in the company derived tax benefits from an exclusion provided under us income tax laws with respect to certain extraterritorial income attributable to foreign trading gross receipts ftgrs 
this exclusion was repealed as part of the american jobs creation act of the ajca  which was enacted on october  the ajca provides for a phase out such that the exclusion for the company s otherwise qualifying ftgrs generated in fiscal and will be limited to and  respectively 
no exclusion will be available in fiscal years and thereafter 
the ajca also provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities  which will be phased in from through under the guidance in financial accounting standards board fasb staff positions fsp fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of  the deduction will be treated as a special deduction as described in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as such  the special deduction has no effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at the enactment date 
the impact of this deduction will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on our tax return 
in  the company is evaluating the effects of indefinitely reinvesting undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 
in prior years  the company provided us deferred income taxes on all undistributed earnings from non us subsidiaries 
we expect to complete our evaluation in results of operations this md a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily indicative of future performance 
you should consider our prospects in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies that operate in evolving markets 
we may not be able to 
table of contents successfully address these risks and difficulties and  consequently  we cannot assure you of any future growth or profitability

sales within our direct segment were million in  an increase of compared with our direct segment accounted for of our aggregate net sales in  as compared to of net sales in the sales growth in our direct segment occurred primarily in the second half of the year 
the growth was due to several factors  including product innovation in the bowflex home gym line  strong demand for the less than two year old bowflex treadclimber cardio products  and the introduction of bowflex selecttech dumbbells  coupled with more effective advertising placement and an increase in consumer financing approval rates 
sales within our commercial retail segment were million in as compared to million  an increase of million or 
the increase in sales within the commercial retail segment was primarily attributable to a million increase in the sale of bowflex branded products within the retail side of the business

the gross profit margin decreased to in from in the gross profit margin within our direct segment was in compared to in approximately percentage points of the decline was due to increased promotions to drive sales growth 
approximately percentage points of the decline was due to a change in sales mix from the higher margin bowflex home gym products to the treadclimber and selecttech products 
as we continue to sell more units of the treadclimber we believe our treadclimber margins will increase due to the leveraging of our costs 
additionally  approximately percentage points of the decline was due to increased shipping costs due to the combination of carrier rate increase and certain sales promotions 
the gross profit margin within our commercial retail segment was in  compared to in the decline was due to the expansion of sales into large volume  lower margin retail customers consistent with our diversification strategy along with increased shipping costs due to carrier rates 
this decline was partially offset by the overall increase in commercial retail sales which allowed us to leverage our fixed costs 
operating expenses selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses were million for compared to million for  an increase of million or

royalties royalty expense decreased to million in as compared to million in our direct and commercial retail segments have several agreements under which we are obligated to pay royalty fees on certain products 
the decrease in our royalty expense was primarily attributable to the april expiration of a royalty agreement related to the bowflex patents 
this decrease in bowflex related royalties was partially offset by royalty expense associated with our treadclimber and elliptical product sales 
we are obligated to pay royalties  at the rate of of treadclimber sales  to the inventor of the main patent on the treadclimber until this patent expires on december  effective income tax rates the effective income tax rate decreased from in to in the decrease in the effective income tax rate is primarily due to tax reserve adjustments as a result of favorable resolutions of certain federal and state income tax issues  tax advantaged investment income and research and development credits 
as more fully disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the effective income tax rate reflects a benefit for certain income exclusions provided for under us income tax laws 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  this exclusion has been repealed and will be phased out commencing net income for the reasons discussed above  net income declined to million in from million in  a decrease of 
net income in the second half of the year actually increased by compared to the prior year as we began experiencing the growth benefits of our turnaround strategy 
comparison of the years ended december  and december  net sales net sales decreased by in compared to we believe this was primarily due to increased competition and higher advertising costs due to increased demand for advertising time 
these factors reduced sales conversion rates for our direct marketed products 
sales within our direct segment were million in  a decrease of compared with our direct segment accounted for of our aggregate net sales in  down from in the decrease in direct segment sales can be attributed to a combination of factors including increased competition for our 
table of contents bowflex product line and managing our advertising spending in a higher advertising cost environment to optimize profitability 
we believe competing products adversely affected demand for our bowflex products 
additionally  advertising costs rose when comparing to  resulting in lower sales of direct marketed products for comparable advertising spending 
as a percentage of sales  selling and marketing expense for the direct segment was in compared to in sales within our commercial retail segment were million in  an increase of over excluding our acquisition of stairmaster  commercial retail segment sales increased during compared to the increase in sales within the commercial retail segment was primarily attributable to the introduction of the bowflex to the retail side of the business  which equated to sales of million

the increase in gross profit margin within our commercial retail segment to in  compared with in  was primarily due to sales of bowflex products through the retail channel

we experienced an increase in direct marketing advertising spending during in response to declines in our sales conversion rates coupled with a higher advertising cost environment 
we believe the decline in conversion was a result of increased competition 
in addition  depreciation associated with our newly implemented customer relationship management information system also contributed to the increase in selling and marketing costs 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased in compared to as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in our direct segment accounted for million of the million increase due primarily to depreciation  consulting costs  and wages associated with our newly implemented computer information systems

quarterly results of operations the following table presents our operating results for each of the quarters in the periods ended december  and the information for each of these quarters is unaudited and has been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in the opinion of management  all necessary adjustments have been included to present fairly the unaudited quarterly results when read together with our audited financial statements and the related notes 
certain amounts from previous periods have been reclassified to conform to the full year presentation with no effect on previously reported consolidated net income or stockholders equity 
these operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results of any future period 
due to diversification towards our commercial retail segment  we expect heightened seasonality in our business 
we expect sales in the second quarter to be weakest while the fourth quarter should be our strongest 
we expect the third quarter will generally be stronger than the first quarter 
quarter ended in thousands except per share march june september december total fiscal net sales gross profit operating income net income earnings per share basic diluted fiscal net sales gross profit operating income net income earnings per share basic diluted 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our business primarily from cash generated by our operating activities 
during  our operating activities generated million in net cash  which contributed to an aggregate million balance in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at year end  compared with million in net cash generated by our operating activities in working capital was million at december  compared to million at december   largely due to increased short term investments as a result of net income for the period 
the million increase in trade receivables and million decrease in inventory levels can primarily be attributed to supply chain issues resulting in many shipments occurring later in the fourth quarter of as compared with the million increase in trade payables is primarily due to the timing of inventory purchases and payments for those purchases 
the million decrease in accrued liabilities can primarily be attributed to the completion of the product recall which was accrued at december  net cash used in investing activities was million in compared with net cash used in investing activities in of million 
the change in cash flow from investing activities is primarily due to million for capital expenditures primarily consisting of building improvements  manufacturing equipment and information systems and related equipment compared to million in short term investments increased by million in compared to million in net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to million in the primary difference between the years related to cash received from the exercise of stock options of million in as compared to million in during  the company paid million in dividends compared to million during we maintain a million line of credit with a lending institution 
the line of credit is secured by certain assets and contains several financial covenants 
as of the date of this filing  we are in compliance with the covenants applicable to the line of credit  and there is no outstanding balance under the line 
at december  and  the company had million and million  respectively in stand by letters of credit with asian vendors reducing the available balance of the million line of credit 
we believe our existing cash balances  cash generated from operations and borrowings available under our line of credit  will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments as defined in item a of regulation s k under the securities exchange act of as of december  are as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total certain contractual obligations and commercial commitments are excluded from this table because they require imprecise measurement or are of a contingent nature eg off balance sheet arrangements described below 
due to the majority of our inventory being sourced from asia  the company has long lead times for inventory purchases and needs to secure factory capacity from our vendors in advance 
as a result  approximately million of the million in purchase obligations is for inventory purchases 
this inventory is predominately related to anticipated sales in the first half of 
table of contents off balance sheet arrangements from time to time  we arrange for leases or other financing sources with third parties to enable certain of our commercial customers to purchase our equipment 
while most of these financings are without recourse  in certain cases we may offer a guaranty or other recourse provisions 
the purpose of these guaranties is to increase our selling opportunities to commercial customers that would not otherwise be able to obtain financing to purchase our equipment 
at december  and  the maximum contingent liability under all recourse provisions was approximately million and million  respectively 
refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the accounting treatment for these arrangements 
we expect an increase in these types of arrangements going forward 
inflation and price changes although we cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation on our operations  with the exception of steel and fuel prices discussed below  we do not believe that inflation has had  or is likely in the foreseeable future to have  a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  increases in inflation over historical levels or uncertainty in the general economy could decrease discretionary consumer spending for products like ours 
very little of our revenue variation from prior periods is attributable to price changes 
during  we experienced increases in the price of steel  a major component of our products  and in distributions costs as the result of an increase in the price of fuel 
we expect that to the extent costs continue to increase our gross margins in will continue to be negatively impacted by increased steel and fuel prices 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
clarifies that abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities  excess freight and handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage are required to be recognized as current period charges 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company is currently evaluating the provisions of sfas no 
and does not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r share based payment  which requires companies to recognize in their statement of operations the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees 
sfas no 
r is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after june  accordingly  we will adopt sfas no 
r in our third quarter of the company is evaluating the impact that sfas no 
r will have on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no  exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb no 
the amendments made by sfas no 
are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
further  the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
this standard is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring after july  the adoption of this standard is not expected to impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
the ajca was enacted on october  the ajca repeals an export incentive  creates a new deduction for qualified domestic manufacturing activities and includes a special one time deduction of of certain foreign earnings repatriated to the us the fasb issued fsp fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of 
table of contents fsp fas on december  in accordance with fsp fas  the company will treat the deduction for qualified domestic manufacturing activities as a reduction of the income tax provision in future years as realized 
the deduction for qualified domestic manufacturing activities did not impact the company s consolidated financial statements in  and this deduction combined with the phase out of the export incentive is not expected to have a material impact on the company s effective tax rate in in december  the fasb issued fsp fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of  allowing companies additional time to evaluate the effect of the ajca on plans for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings 
the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the company s effective tax rate in risks and uncertainties because of the following factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results  past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance  and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
a significant decline in availability of media time or fluctuating advertising rates may hinder our ability to effectively market our products and may reduce profitability 
we depend primarily on and second spot television commercials and minute television infomercials to market and sell our direct marketed products 
consequently  a marked increase in the price we must pay for our preferred media time or a reduction in its availability may adversely impact our financial performance 
a decline in consumer spending due to unfavorable economic conditions could hinder our product revenues and earnings 
the success of each of our products depends substantially on the amount of discretionary funds available to consumers and their purchasing preferences 
economic and political uncertainties could adversely impact the us and international economic environment 
a decline in general economic conditions could further depress consumer spending  especially discretionary spending for premium priced products like ours 
these poor economic conditions could in turn lead to substantial decreases in our net sales 
a decline in our ability to effectively develop  market and sell future products could adversely affect our ability to generate future revenues and earnings 
our future success depends on our ability to develop or acquire the rights to  and then effectively market and sell  new products that create and respond to new and evolving consumer demands 
accordingly  our net sales and profitability may be harmed if we are unable to develop  or acquire the rights to  new and different products that satisfy our marketing criteria 
in addition  any new products that we market may not generate sufficient net sales or profits to recoup their development or acquisition costs 
we also may not be able to successfully acquire intellectual property rights or potentially prevent others from claiming that we have violated their proprietary rights when we launch new products 
we could incur substantial costs in defending against such claims  even if they are without basis  and we could become subject to judgments requiring us to pay substantial damages 
a delay in getting foreign sourced products through customs in a timely manner could result in cancelled orders and unanticipated inventory accumulation 
many of our imported products are subject to duties  tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states or into our other sales markets 
the countries in which our products are produced or sold may adjust or impose new quotas  duties  tariffs or other restrictions  any of which could have a material adverse effect on us 

table of contents our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner 
as a result  we rely on the free flow of goods through open and operational ports worldwide 
labor disputes at various ports create significant risks for our business  particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns  lockouts  strikes  or other disruptions during our peak importing seasons  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  potentially resulting in cancelled orders by customers  unanticipated inventory accumulation  and reduced revenues and earnings 
any failure by us to manage acquisitions and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results  business and prospects 
as we have done in the past  we may seek to acquire other businesses in the future 
integrating acquired businesses into our operations poses significant challenges  particularly with respect to corporate cultures and management teams 
failure to successfully effect the integration could adversely impact the revenue  earnings and business synergies we expect from the acquisitions 
in addition  the process of integrating acquired businesses may be disruptive to our operations and may cause an interruption of  or a loss of momentum in  our core business 
our future integration efforts may be jeopardized  and our actual return on investment from such acquisitions may be lower than anticipated  as a result of various factors  including the following challenges in the successful integration of the products  services or personnel of the acquired business into our operations  loss of employees or customers that are key to the acquired business  time and money spent by our management team focusing on the integration  which could distract it from our core operations  our potential lack of experience in markets of the acquired businesses  possible inconsistencies in standards  controls  procedures and policies among the combined companies and the need to implement our financial  accounting  information and other systems  and the need to coordinate geographically diverse operations 
our failure or inability to protect our intellectual property could significantly harm our competitive position 
protecting our intellectual property is an essential factor in maintaining our competitive position in the health and fitness industry 
if we do not or are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property  our sales and profitability could be adversely affected 
we currently hold a number of patents and trademarks and have several patent and trademark applications pending 
however  our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may be inadequate and applicable laws provide only limited protection 
the introduction of lower priced competing products could significantly harm our ability to generate future revenues and earnings 
our products are sold in highly competitive markets with limited barriers to entry 
as a result the introduction of lower priced competing products by our competitors could result in a significant decline in our net sales 
unpredictable events and circumstances relating to our international operations  including our use of foreign manufacturers could result in cancelled orders  unanticipated inventory accumulation  and reduced revenues and earnings 
a portion of our revenue is derived from sales outside the united states 
for the year ended december   international sales represented approximately of consolidated net sales

government regulatory actions could disrupt our marketing efforts and product sales 
various federal  state and local government authorities  including the federal trade commission and the cpsc  regulate our marketing efforts and products 
our sales and profitability could be significantly harmed if any of these authorities commence a regulatory enforcement action that interrupts our marketing efforts  results in a product recall or negative publicity  or requires changes in product design 
the cpsc is investigating whether the company violated the reporting obligations of the consumer product safety act 
as detailed in item  legal proceedings  penalties are possible in connection with this investigation 
in order to be successful  we must retain and motivate key employees  and failure to do so could have an adverse impact on our business 
our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key personnel  particularly gregg hammann  our president  chief executive officer and chairman of the company s board of directors 
our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain key managers  product development engineers  sales people  and others 
we face intense competition for such individuals worldwide 
not being able to attract or retain these employees could have a material adverse effect on revenues and earnings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have primarily invested cash with banks and in liquid debt instruments purchased with maturity dates of less than one year 
our bank deposits may exceed federally insured limits  and there is risk of loss of the entire principal with any debt instrument 
to reduce risk of loss  we limit our exposure to any individual debt issuer and require certain minimum ratings for debt instruments that we purchase 
foreign exchange risk the company is exposed to foreign exchange risk from currency fluctuations  mainly in europe 
given the relative size of the company s current foreign operations  the company does not believe the exposure to changes in applicable foreign currencies to be material  such that it could have a significant impact on our current or near term financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
management estimates the maximum impact on stockholders equity of a change in any applicable foreign currency to be million 
interest rate risk the company has financed its growth through cash generated from operations 
at december   the company had no outstanding borrowings and was not subject to any related interest rate risk 
the company invests in liquid debt instruments purchased with maturity dates of less than one year 
due to the short term nature of those investments  management believes that any reasonably possible near term changes in related interest rates would not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows
