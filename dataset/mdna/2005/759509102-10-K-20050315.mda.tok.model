table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the year was unlike any other that we have seen for the metals service center industry 
we experienced unprecedented high prices for most carbon steel products  along with higher prices for stainless steel and aluminum products  coupled with improved demand from our customers 
this environment allowed reliance and many other metals service center companies to generate record financial results 
demand for most of our products improved modestly in from levels 
customer demand was at low levels for most products that we sell from through primarily related to the economic downturn experienced in the united states during that period 
in there was a significant increase in global demand that impacted supply levels in the united states  however  we believe that domestic demand is still well below peak levels for most of our products 
aerospace is the one area where demand increased consistently during  and we expect it to continue through we expect modest increases  if any  in demand for other products in pricing for carbon steel products increased significantly and rapidly in  especially in the first half of the year 
this resulted mainly from supply limitations due to shortages of raw materials at the mill level because of increased global demand for these raw materials  due to lower domestic capacity as some mill capacity was shut down during and  and due to reduced quantities of import material entering the united states because of higher pricing levels in other parts of the world  especially china 
aluminum and stainless steel costs increased consistently during most of due to improved demand and some supply limitations 
aluminum products used by the aerospace industry are in tight supply and prices for these products are expected to continue to increase into because of the improved demand in  we were typically able to increase our selling prices for most products at a rate equal to or above our cost increases 
because of the reduced supply of carbon steel products  in the first half of the year we were able to increase our selling prices for these products prior to receiving the higher cost metal into our inventory 
these significant increases resulted in higher gross profit margins than we have experienced in recent years 
although we are extremely proud of our record financial results  we are also proud of our ability to consistently generate profitable returns even during the poor economic environment experienced from through in addition to profitability  we focus on working capital management which allows us to generate cash flow to further expand and strengthen our business and reduce debt during most environments 
although we did not complete any acquisitions in  we continued to evaluate opportunities that would allow us to improve our profitability 
we reviewed acquisition opportunities  but did not complete any as we continued to apply our strict criteria 
we also identified opportunities to expand our existing operations and took actions to allow for this profitable future growth 
in we completed our largest acquisition to date that has contributed significantly to our financial results  however  this acquisition required us to increase our leverage and to provide security under our credit agreements 
as a result of our strong earnings and resulting cash flow in  we have reduced our leverage to a level that will allow this security interest to be released in the first quarter of we believe that the steps that we took during the difficult years of through positioned us to take full advantage of the improved economic conditions we experienced in however  as evidenced by our performance during the difficult years  we take the necessary actions to allow us to operate efficiently and profitably even in less favorable economies 
we believe this is because of our focus on cost controls and inventory turnover and our product  customer and geographic diversification 
in the fourth quarter of we experienced some softening of carbon steel prices that we believe was due to the normal seasonal slowdown along with higher inventory levels at many of our competitors 
this caused our gross margin levels to reduce somewhat 
however  we believe that the current pricing levels for carbon steel products makes for a very attractive operating environment 
our product and geographic diversification should benefit us in  as we expect demand and pricing for certain aluminum and stainless steel products to continue to increase above levels 
we are optimistic about business conditions in  and while we do not expect the benefit of rapidly accelerating prices as we experienced in  we do expect to be a strong year for reliance when compared to all years except  although we cannot provide any assurance that it will be 
significant declines in demand or pricing for our products could reduce our gross margins 
also  if we cannot obtain a sufficient supply of metals for our customers in  or if domestic availability of our products increases significantly in  this could negatively impact our financial results  especially as compared to our results 

table of contents customer demand can have a significant impact on our results of operations 
when volume increases  our revenue dollars increase  which contributes to increased gross profit dollars 
variable costs may also increase with volume including increases in our warehouse  delivery  selling  general and administrative expenses 
conversely  when volume declines  we typically produce fewer revenue dollars which can reduce our gross profit dollars 
we can reduce certain variable expenses when volumes decline  but we cannot easily reduce our fixed costs 
pricing for our products can have a more significant impact on our results of operations than customer demand levels 
as pricing increases  so do our revenue dollars 
our pricing usually increases when the cost of our materials increases 
if prices increase and we maintain the same gross profit percentage  we generate higher levels of gross profit and pre tax income dollars 
conversely  if pricing declines  we will typically generate lower levels of gross profits and pre tax income dollars 
because changes in pricing do not require us to adjust our expense structure  the impact on our results of operations is much greater than the effect of volume changes 
also  when volume or pricing increases  our working capital requirements typically increase  which may require us to increase our outstanding debt 
this could increase our interest expense 
when our customer demand falls  we can typically generate strong levels of cash flow from operations as our working capital needs decrease 
recent developments we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and expect to continue to grow our business in part through acquisitions 
although we did not complete any acquisitions in  we did expand certain of our existing operations 
we relocated two operations into larger and more efficient facilities and we added processing equipment in certain facilities to expand or enhance their processing services 
in we completed our largest acquisition to date 
through that transaction  we entered into new geographic markets in indiana and kentucky  strengthened our presence in the midwest region of the united states  and expanded our service offerings 
the acquisition made in of a metals processor did not result in a new segment 
on july   we purchased all of the outstanding stock of precision strip  inc and its related entity  precision strip transport  inc 
collectively precision strip for million in cash  plus the assumption of approximately million of debt 
in  we made an additional payment of million to the precision strip sellers to reimburse them for increased income taxes related to a tax election that we made 
precision strip is a privately held metals processing company founded in whose processing activities consist primarily of slitting and blanking carbon steel  stainless steel and aluminum flat rolled products on a toll basis  that is  processing the metal for a fee without taking ownership of the metal 
precision strip s revenues for the twelve months ended december  were million 
the business has facilities in minster  kenton  middletown and tipp city  ohio  anderson and rockport  indiana  bowling green  kentucky  and talladega  alabama 
precision strip s customers include carbon steel  stainless steel and aluminum mills  as well as companies in the automotive  appliance  metal furniture and capital goods industries 
based on the volume of metal processed  we estimate that precision strip processed more than billion of metal in results of operations the following table sets forth certain income statement data for each of the three years in the period ended december  dollars are shown in thousands and certain amounts may not calculate due to rounding of of of net sales net sales net sales net sales gross profit s  g a expenses depreciation expense operating profit excludes other income  amortization expense  equity in earnings of owned company  minority interest  interest expense and income tax expense 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
our consolidated net sales were a record billion  an increase of  compared to billion in this increase includes the additional sales from precision strip that we acquired in july our increased sales include an increase in our tons sold of and an increase in the average selling price per ton sold of the tons sold and average selling price per ton sold exclude amounts related to precision strip 
the increase in our tons sold is mainly due to somewhat improved customer demand in all markets in as compared to levels 
we began to experience higher sales volumes in september that continued through the first nine months of this included a peak in the march period  which we believe was due in part to increased buying by our customers to beat announced mill price increases 
in the fourth quarter of  we experienced a slight slowdown from earlier in the year  which we believe was mainly due to the typical seasonal slowdown during this period 
the increase in our average selling price per ton sold of resulted mainly from significant increases in our costs of carbon steel products along with limited supply during most of carbon steel costs increased significantly in the first nine months of  with the most rapid and pronounced increases in the first half of the year 
supply was limited due to raw material shortages at the mill level resulting from increased global demand  especially china  and reduced domestic capacity 
this resulted in increased costs from the mills and an environment that allowed us to pass through our increased costs to our customers 
in some cases  we were able to pass through the significant cost increases before we received the higher cost metal in our inventory 
carbon steel costs are still at high levels  however we did experience some softening of carbon steel prices in the fourth quarter of our prices for aluminum and stainless steel products increased consistently during most of due to reduced supply and improved customer demand  especially for aerospace products 
gross profit 
our total gross profit of million increased from mainly because of the increased pricing levels of our products in our gross profit as a percentage of sales was in  up from in the improvement in our gross profit percentage resulted from the improved business conditions discussed above that allowed us to pass through our cost increases to our customers  especially in the first half of when we were able to increase our selling prices before we received the higher cost metal in our inventory 
due to the increased cost of our metals  our cost of sales includes million of lifo expense  compared to million of lifo expense in lifo expense reduces our gross profit 
expenses 
warehouse  delivery  selling  general and administrative expenses s  g a expenses for increased million  or from this increase includes a full year of s  g a expenses of precision strip  along with increased expenses to support our higher sales levels  including higher incentives and bonuses due to the record profit levels achieved at many of our operations 
our s  g a expenses represented of sales in  down from in the improvement as a percentage of sales was mainly because of the significant increases in our average selling price per ton sold  which did not require us to change our expense structure 
depreciation expense increased million in over mainly because of the additional expense related to precision strip 
operating profit 
operating profit  calculated as gross profit less s  g a expenses and depreciation expense  was million in  resulting in an operating profit margin of  compared to operating profit of million and an operating profit margin of 
the significant improvement occurred because of the improved business conditions  especially the favorable pricing  discussed above 
other income and expense 
interest expense was million in compared to million in the increase was mainly due to increased borrowing levels to fund our increased working capital needs in and to fund the acquisition of precision strip on july  although variable interest rates increased in  we were able to offset the effect of this as the pricing on our borrowings declined due to our improved profitability 
minority interest expense increased in compared to mainly due to the improved operating performance at our owned company  american steel  llc  that sells primarily carbon steel plate products 
minority interest also includes expense related to valex korea during the first seven months of that is attributable to our partner 
in july we purchased the remaining interest in valex korea from our partner 
valex korea s performance benefited from a strong asian market for semiconductor products in income tax rate 
our effective income tax rate was in  down from in  mainly due to shifts in the geographic composition of our income  lower income tax rates from our foreign operations that were profitable in and benefits from state and city income tax credits 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
our consolidated net sales were billion  an increase of  compared to billion in this increase includes the additional sales from the companies we acquired in and our tons sold decreased and our average selling price per ton sold increased the tons sold and average selling price per ton sold exclude amounts related to precision strip 
the decrease in our tons sold is mainly due to reduced customer demand in all markets through the first eight months of our sales volumes continued at the low levels experienced in the second half of until september  when we began to experience some improvement in demand across most product and customer markets 
this improvement continued through the remainder of the increase in our average selling price per ton sold of resulted mainly from costs of carbon steel flat rolled products increasing in the second half of due to supply constraints resulting from the temporary closure of a few mills and due to tariffs placed on imports 
these prices remained high in early and then declined somewhat until late in the third quarter of when carbon steel costs began to increase due to a shortage of scrap and other raw materials and high energy costs for the producers 
the scrap shortage is a result of the increase in global steel demand  especially in china 
the costs for carbon steel continued to increase very rapidly in the fourth quarter of  and we increased our selling prices accordingly 
we also increased our prices for aluminum and stainless steel products due to reduced supply and improved customer demand that resulted in increased costs in the second half of our same store sales excludes sales of businesses we acquired in and increased million  or  with year tons sold declining as compared to  and the average selling price per ton sold increasing by 
these changes were due to the factors discussed above 
gross profit 
our total gross profit of million increased from mainly because of our increase in sales due to our and acquisitions and due to our increased selling prices 
our gross profit as a percentage of sales was in compared to in the decline in our gross profit margin occurred primarily due to competitive pressures resulting from low levels of customer demand in the first half of when we reduced our selling prices at a more rapid rate than our material costs were declining 
this resulted in lower gross profit margins 
beginning in september  we experienced improved customer demand that allowed us to increase our selling prices and expand our gross profit margins 
expenses 
our s  g a expenses increased million  or  from this increase includes the s  g a expenses of the company we acquired in plus a full year of expenses for our acquisitions 
we were able to reduce our same store s  g a expenses by million in as compared to these expenses represented and of sales in and  respectively 
the improvement as a percentage of sales resulted from our continued focus on expense reduction and an increase in our average selling price per ton sold 
depreciation expense increased million for compared to because of the inclusion of depreciation expense related to the companies we acquired in and operating profit 
operating profit increased million  or  in compared to this occurred mainly due to the operating profit from our acquisition 
other income and expense 
interest expense of million increased by in compared to  due to increased borrowing levels to fund our acquisition of precision strip for million plus the assumption of approximately million of outstanding debt on july  because of our increased ownership interest in american steel  we began to consolidate its results beginning may  prior to that date  we accounted for our investment using the equity method 
on our income statement  the equity in earnings of owned company represents our of american steel s net income from january through april th 
the minority interest amount represents of american steel s net income or loss beginning may  for the portion that we do not own 
minority interest also includes the net income or loss from the interest in valex korea co 
ltd 
and the interest in valex corp 
that we do not own 
american steel incurred a loss in due to the continued depressed economic conditions in the northwest region of the united states  including the loss of certain large carbon steel customers in that area over the past few years 
income tax rate 
our effective income tax rate decreased from in to in  mainly due to shifts in the geographic composition of our income  and due to the resolution of open tax issues 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources at december   our working capital was million  up from million at december  the increase was primarily due to an increase in our accounts receivable of million and an increase in our inventory of million resulting from our improved sales levels  offset by an increase in our accounts payable and accrued expenses of million due to our increased costs of inventory 
our current debt maturities also increased by million at december  over the prior year end 
to manage our working capital  we focus on our days sales outstanding to monitor accounts receivable and on our inventory turnover rate to monitor our inventory levels  as receivables and inventory are our two most significant elements of working capital 
although the amount of our accounts receivable increased significantly in due to the higher pricing levels  our accounts receivable days sales outstanding rate at december  was days  improved from our december  rate of days 
we calculate our days sales outstanding as an average of the most recent two month period 
our inventory turnover rate improved to about times in from about times in the increase in our accounts payable balance was mainly due to the increased costs for the metals we purchased in as demand and pricing for our products increase or decrease  our working capital needs increase or decrease  respectively 
we expect to finance increases in our working capital needs through operating cash flow or with borrowings on our syndicated credit facility 
our primary sources of liquidity are generally from our internally generated funds from operations and our revolving line of credit 
our operations provided cash of million in compared to million in although our working capital needs increased in  our strong earnings and effective working capital management provided cash flow from operations 
the cash generated from operations in was also used to fund our capital expenditures  to pay an additional amount due for the reimbursement of the tax differential for our election of section h treatment related to our acquisition and to pay down debt 
during  we made net debt repayments of million  including payment of million of private placement notes upon their maturity 
this resulted in a net debt to capital ratio of at december  compared to at december  our debt to ebitda ratio  calculated as defined by our syndicated credit facility  decreased to at december  from at december  our syndicated credit facility allows for million in borrowings 
as of december   million was outstanding under this credit facility 
the million five year secured syndicated credit facility  as amended effective december   is with banks and may be increased to million 
at december   we had million of letters of credit outstanding under our syndicated credit facility 
on january  date of maturity  we paid off million of private placement notes with borrowings on our syndicated credit facility 
at december   we had outstanding with insurance companies senior secured notes in the aggregate amount of million 
these privately placed senior notes have maturity dates ranging from to  and bear interest at an average rate of per annum 
in  million of these notes mature  including the million note paid off in january  and we expect to pay these amounts with cash generated from operations or borrowings on our syndicated credit facility 
the syndicated credit facility and senior note agreements were amended effective july  to provide  among other things  for our company to grant a security interest in certain personal property to the lenders named therein 
the security interest was structured to terminate automatically when we meet certain conditions  including a required leverage ratio 
as of december   we have satisfied the conditions for the security interest to be released and expect this to occur in the first quarter of the syndicated credit facility and senior note agreements  as amended  also require that we maintain a minimum net worth and interest coverage ratio  and a maximum leverage ratio  and include restrictions on the amount of cash dividends we may pay 
in december we amended our syndicated credit facility to increase the maximum amount of cash dividends that we could pay to our shareholders during the last six months of our net capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  were million for the year 
we had no material commitments for capital expenditures or capital leases as of december  our capital expenditures are currently budgeted at million 
historically  our actual capital expenditures have been less than our budgeted amount 
any capital expenditure commitments that existed at december  are included in the below table of contractual obligations 
our operating lease commitments are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our capital requirements are primarily for working capital  acquisitions  and capital expenditures for continued improvements in plant capacities and materials handling and processing equipment 
we anticipate that funds generated from operations and funds available under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditure and senior debt repayment needs for the foreseeable future 
we also anticipate that we will 
table of contents be able to fund acquisitions with borrowings under our line of credit 
however  the acquisition of a significant company may require that we raise additional capital beyond our currently available instruments 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  certain of these contractual obligations are reflected on our balance sheet  while others are disclosed as future obligations under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
payments due by year in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet under gaap total amounts include principal payments only 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for information regarding interest rates and payment dates 
includes capital expenditure items committed to as of december   including a lease buy out option at fair market value 
the fair market value has been estimated at million based upon market comparisons 
includes non cancelable purchase or service contracts with a term of one year or greater that existed at december  the majority of our material purchases are completed within to days and therefore are not included in this table 
also includes the amount of the put option to purchase the remaining interest in american steel  llc  per the terms of the operating agreement 
includes the estimated benefit payments or contribution amounts for the company s defined benefit pension plans and serp plans for the next ten years 
these amounts are limited to the information provided by our actuaries 
contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on our company and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are typically fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
in addition  some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of goods specifying minimum quantities and set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
therefore  agreements for the purchase of goods and services are not included in the table above 
the expected timing of payments of the obligations above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different  depending on the time of receipt of goods or services  or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
on august   our board of directors amended our stock repurchase plan and approved the purchase of up to an additional  shares of our outstanding common stock through this plan  for a total of  shares 
since inception of the stock repurchase plan  we have purchased a total of  shares of our common stock  at an average purchase price of per share  as of december   all of which are being treated as authorized but unissued shares 
in and  we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock 
we believe such purchases  given appropriate circumstances  enhance shareholder value and reflect our confidence in the long term growth potential of our company 
inflation our operations have not been  and we do not expect them to be  materially affected by general inflation 
historically  we have been successful in adjusting prices to our customers to reflect changes in metal prices 

table of contents seasonality some of our customers may be in seasonal businesses  especially customers in the construction industry 
as a result of our geographic  product and customer diversity  however  our operations have not shown any material seasonal trends 
revenues in the months of november and december traditionally have been lower than in other months because of a reduced number of working days for shipments of our products and holiday closures of some of our customers 
we cannot assure you that period to period fluctuations will not occur in the future 
results of any one or more quarters are therefore not necessarily indicative of annual results 
goodwill goodwill  which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired  amounted to million at december   or approximately of total assets or of consolidated shareholders equity 
under statement of financial accounting standards sfas or statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill deemed to have indefinite lives is no longer amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statement 
other intangible assets continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we review the recoverability of goodwill annually or whenever significant events or changes occur which might impair the recovery of recorded costs 
we measure possible impairment based on either significant losses of an entity or the ability to recover the balance of the long lived asset from expected future operating cash flows on an undiscounted basis 
if impairment is identified  we would calculate the amount of such impairment based upon the discounted cash flows or the market values as compared to the recorded costs 
we have performed tests of goodwill as of november  and  and believe that the recorded amounts for goodwill are recoverable and that no impairment currently exists 
critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when we prepare these consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
some of our accounting policies require that we make subjective judgments  including estimates that involve matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting estimates include those related to accounts receivable  inventories  income taxes  goodwill and intangible assets and long lived assets 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates  as discussed with our audit committee  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for our summary of significant accounting policies 
there have been no material changes made to the critical accounting estimates during the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  such as for revenue recognition  however these policies do not require us to make subjective estimates or judgments 
accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect our estimate of the uncollectibility of accounts receivable based on an evaluation of specific potential customer risks 
assessments are based on legal issues bankruptcy status  our past collection history  current financial and credit agency reports  and the experience of our credit personnel 
accounts which we determine to be uncollectible are reserved for or written off in the period in which the determination is made 
additional reserves are maintained based on our historical and estimated future bad debt experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  we might be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories we maintain allowances for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory to reflect the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on an evaluation of slow moving products and current replacement 
table of contents costs 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those anticipated by management  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes we currently have significant deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
realizing our deferred tax assets principally depends upon our achieving projected future taxable income 
we may change our judgments regarding future profitability due to future market conditions and other factors 
we may adjust our deferred tax asset balances if our judgments change 
for information regarding our provision for income taxes as well as information regarding differences between our effective tax rate and statutory rates  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our tax rate may be affected by future acquisitions  changes in the geographic composition of our income from operations  changes in our estimates of credits or deductions including those that may result from the american jobs creation act of  and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities 
goodwill and intangible assets in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
we have performed impairment testing in accordance with sfas no 
we perform an annual review in the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if the carrying value of the recorded goodwill is impaired 
our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which goodwill resides to its carrying value 
we estimate the reporting unit s fair value based on a discounted future cash flow approach that requires us to estimate income from operations based on historical results and discount rates based on a weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies 
a key assumption made is that  in general  our revenues will grow at to per year  adjusted for the current economic outlook 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
long lived assets we review the recoverability of our long lived assets as required by sfas no 
and must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to various market risk factors  including changes in general economic conditions  domestic and foreign competition  foreign currency exchange rates  and metals pricing and availability 
additionally  we are exposed to market risk primarily related to our fixed rate long term debt 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates 
decreases in interest rates may affect the market value of our fixed rate debt 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
based on our debt  we do not consider the exposure to interest rate risk to be material 
our fixed rate debt obligations are not callable until maturity
