white mountains intends statements which are not historical in nature  and are hereby identified as forward looking statements  to be covered by the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of white mountains cannot promise that its expectations in such forward looking statements will turn out to be correct 
white mountains actual results could be materially different from and worse than its expectations 
see forward looking statements for specific important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements 
the following discussion also includes two non gaap financial measures  adjusted comprehensive net income and fully converted tangible book value per share  that have been reconciled to their most comparable gaap financial measures see page 
white mountains believes these measures to be more relevant than comparable gaap measures in evaluating white mountains financial performance 
results of operations for the years ended december   and overview white mountains ended with a fully converted tangible book value per common share of  which represents an increase of including dividends over the fully converted tangible book value per common share of as of december  during  fully converted tangible book value per common share increased by including dividends from as of december  adjusted comprehensive net income was million for  compared to million in net income for was million  compared to million in the growth in book value was driven by strong investment results  particularly equities which returned  and million in transaction gains 
this more than offset the impact of higher than expected losses from catastrophes and prior year reserve development 
the growth in earnings was primarily driven by the transaction gains as both and had strong investment results 
all three business segments performed well 
onebeacon s combined ratio in was  the second consecutive year it was below  and esurance earned a profit for the first time in white mountains re had a combined ratio of due to points from catastrophes 
however  the segment contributed million in transaction gains and therefore was a significant contributor to the company s growth in book value for the year 
fully converted tangible book value per share the following table presents the company s tangible book value per share for the years ended december    and and reconciles this non gaap measure to the most comparable gaap measure

net investment income grew in primarily due to the income earned on the additional invested assets acquired in the sirius acquisition offset by decreased net invested assets at onebeacon 
white mountains total expenses grew for as loss and lae  insurance acquisition and underwriting expenses were all up due to the sirius acquisition and atlantic specialty transactions 
general and administrative costs were up in  primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation accruals  which were driven by a rise in white mountains stock price during the year 
white mountains expenses its full cost of all incentive compensation programs 
this expense is spread among loss and lae  other underwriting expense and general and administrative expense for white mountains insurance and reinsurance operating subsidiaries  depending upon the function of the employees being compensated 
for other operations  it is entirely included in general and administrative expenses 
white mountains net income in also benefitted from million in transaction gains million from the sirius acquisition  million for the symetra investment  million from the tryg baltica acquisition and million from the sierra group acquisition 
consolidated results year ended december  versus year ended december  white mountains total revenues decreased by in compared to  as an increase in earned reinsurance premiums at folksamerica was more than offset by a decrease in earned insurance premiums at onebeacon as a result of the business transferred to liberty mutual under the liberty agreement 
total revenues in were also impacted by decreased net investment income due to the run off of loss reserves from onebeacon s other businesses as well as the reduced interest rate environment 
the decline in total revenues in was partially offset by an increase in other revenues  primarily as a result of million in gains recorded during related to the sale of several real estate properties previously written off under purchase accounting for onebeacon and a million increase in fees and commissions for business placed by wmu 
total expenses decreased by in as compared to  as loss and lae  as well as insurance acquisition and other underwriting expenses  decreased at onebeacon as a result of improved underwriting performance on its on going businesses and as the continued run off of unprofitable business through the liberty agreement 
in addition  interest expense on debt decreased in as a result of the repayment of the million of debt in november and the refinancing of million of debt in may also contributing to the decrease in expenses was a decrease in the accretion of the fair value adjustment to the reserves acquired as part of the onebeacon acquisition 
this accretion will continue to decrease as those acquired reserves are paid over time 
partially offsetting these expense decreases was an increase in general and administrative expense of million in over  primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation accruals  which were driven by a rise in white mountains stock price during income taxes the company is domiciled in bermuda and has subsidiaries domiciled in several countries 
the majority of the company s worldwide operations are taxed in the united states 
income earned or losses incurred by non us companies will generally be subject to an overall effective tax rate lower than that imposed by the united states 
the income tax provision related to pretax earnings for  and represents an effective tax rate of  and  respectively 
white mountains effective tax rate for was lower than the us statutory rate of primarily from income generated in jurisdictions other than the united states and from the recognition of foreign tax credits  offset by taxes incurred from an internal restructuring of the company

in total  adverse development was million in relating primarily to and prior accident years and million in relating primarily to and prior accident years 
the development related primarily to personal auto liability  general liability and multiple peril reserves due in part to emerging trends in claims experienced in onebeacon s run off operations  as well as national account and program claims administered by third parties 
these claim trends principally included higher defense costs and higher damages from liability assessments

onebeacon s total expenses for increased compared to  primarily as a result of increased incentive compensation accruals driven by the rise in white mountains share price in  partially offset by the release of million of the new york assigned risk liability 
the release of this liability resulted from the continued effects of favorable revisions to the structure of credit programs

during the fourth quarter of  onebeacon sold two of its subsidiaries  potomac insurance company of illinois potomac and western states insurance company western states  as well as its boiler inspection service business  and recognized gains on the sales of million through other revenues 
specialty lines 
the specialty lines combined ratio was for  compared to the combined ratio of 
the combined ratio was higher than primarily due to losses relating to the four storms in the southeastern united states that impacted imu and better than expected weather losses in written premiums for specialty lines were up in  driven by growth in writings at obpp and autoone insurance  as well as the introduction of obsp in  a new division offering coverages to the excess and surplus property market 
personal lines 
the combined ratio for personal lines for was  compared to the combined ratio of 
the personal lines combined ratio was adversely impacted by seven points as a result of increased incentive compensation accruals  partially offset by three points due to the reduction of the new york assigned risk liability 
the combined ratio benefitted by four points due to a reduction of the new york assigned risk liability 
premiums in this line grew due in part to improved production of new business and increased retention levels and also million in premiums assumed from new jersey skylands insurance association through a quota share reinsurance agreement 
commercial lines 
the combined ratio for commercial lines for was  compared to the combined ratio of 
the combined ratio was a bit higher as a result of transition and integration costs related to the atlantic specialty transaction and adverse results from its non atlantic mutual new york commercial lines book 
the loss ratio includes two points relating to the four storms in the southeastern united states  which primarily related to atlantic specialty business in that area 
excluding these losses  the commercial lines loss ratio significantly improved 
premiums in this line grew by primarily due to the atlantic specialty transaction 
during the third quarter of  onebeacon entered into an agreement to sell the renewal rights to most of its non atlantic mutual new york commercial lines business to tower insurance group 
the transaction  effective with december  renewals  will remove approximately million of premiums over the next year 
onebeacon results year ended december  versus year ended december  overview onebeacon s pretax income for was million  compared to pre tax income of million for  and its gaap combined ratio was for compared to for all of onebeacon s ongoing businesses specialty  personal and commercial lines delivered combined ratios below in and  in the second half of  its premiums from its ongoing businesses grew for the first time since the onebeacon acquisition 
onebeacon s total revenues for declined by compared to  due principally to a decline in earned premiums  resulting primarily from a reduction in premiums assumed under the liberty agreement 
total revenues for were also impacted by a decrease in net investment income due to the runoff of loss reserves as well as the reduced interest rate environment 
other revenues increased significantly in due mainly to fee revenue generated by new jersey skylands management llc and certain consolidated limited partnerships 
onebeacon s total expenses for declined by compared to  primarily as a result of reduced premium writings and improved underwriting performance 
total expenses in included a net million reserve increase in onebeacon s runoff operations  primarily related to prior year construction defect claims  that was partially offset by an approximate million release of the new york assigned risk liability due to the shrinking new york assigned risk pool 
general and administrative expenses increased significantly in due mainly to expenses generated by new jersey skylands management llc and certain consolidated limited partnerships 
during the fourth quarter of  onebeacon sold one of its subsidiaries  national farmers union standard insurance company nfu standard  for million and recognized a million gain on the sale through other revenue 
specialty lines 
the combined ratio in was  a six point improvement over the reported in this was driven by good underwriting results across onebeacon s various specialty businesses  as well as favorable development in autoone insurance s prior year reserves  which positively impacted the combined ratio by two points 
onebeacon wrote specialty lines premiums of million in  up over  mostly due to an increase in business written by obpp and imu 
personal lines 
the combined ratio in was  a six point improvement over the reported in as price increases achieved in and flowed through into underwriting results 
in addition  the period reflected the reduction in onebeacon s new york assigned risk liability  discussed above  which lowered the combined ratio by three points 
onebeacon s personal lines written premium volume for decreased from  primarily due to re underwriting efforts such as actions to reduce exposure to windstorms on property located in coastal areas 
also contributing to the decrease were declines in written premiums relating to the transfer of onebeacon s private passenger automobile business in new jersey to new jersey skylands insurance association in commercial lines 
the combined ratio in was  a five point improvement over the reported in as the company s efforts to re underwrite its book took hold  partially offset by prior year reserve development of three points 
onebeacon s commercial lines written premium volume for decreased from  primarily due to the continued effects of actions taken to reduce the concentration of risks subject to terrorism  such as reducing total insured values in major cities  and reductions in workers compensation writings 
run off operations 
pursuant to the liberty agreement  liberty mutual assumed control of onebeacon s claims offices in the regions subject to the liberty agreement and was responsible for servicing claims from the onebeacon policies written prior to november   as well as policies which renewed in those regions since that date 
effective july   the servicing agreement with liberty mutual was amended and onebeacon took back substantially all remaining outstanding claims related to policies written prior to the liberty agreement 
during the second quarter of  onebeacon claims and actuarial personnel noticed an unusual spike in case reserves related to the policies taken back from liberty mutual 
the spike was isolated primarily to incurred losses on construction defect claims which were approximately million higher than expected 
there were new claims  higher than expected 
the four states with the largest number of new construction defect claims were california  nevada  colorado and arizona of the total new claims 
as a result  onebeacon claims and actuarial personnel undertook a study to determine the cause of the increase 
this study  which was completed in the third quarter of  indicated that most of the increase in activity was due to differences in case reserving philosophies between onebeacon s and liberty s claims adjusters  such as the identification and coding of construction defect claims 
however  the study also indicated that some of the increase in activity related to an increase in the severity of construction defect claims stemming from increased litigation and resulting adverse court decisions 
as a result  onebeacon recorded an increase for construction defect claim reserves of million in the third quarter of see construction defect claims in critical accounting estimates below for further background on construction defect claims 
white mountains re financial results and gaap combined ratios for white mountains re for the years ended december   and follows year ended december  millions gross written premiums   net written premiums  earned insurance and reinsurance premiums  net investment income net realized investment gains other revenue total revenues  losses and lae insurance and reinsurance acquisition expenses other underwriting expenses general and administrative expenses accretion of fair value adjustment to loss and lae reserves interest expense on debt total expenses  pretax earnings years ended december  gaap ratios loss and lae expense total combined white mountains re results year ended december  versus year ended december  white mountains re s gaap combined ratio increased from in to in  due primarily to million of claims incurred related to significant property catastrophe events in the second half of these catastrophes  which are discussed further below  increased the combined ratio in by points 
in general  white mountains re has experienced favorable underwriting conditions for the past three underwriting years 
earnings from business segments not impacted by the property catastrophe events  and earnings from the recently completed sirius acquisition  have partially offset the impact of these natural disasters 
net written premiums  total revenues  and total expenses were all up substantially in due to the sirius acquisition 
gross written premiums increased million  or from to  and net written premiums increased million  or for the same period 
this increase is due primarily to the sirius acquisition  which contributed million of gross written premiums and million of net written premiums during included in these amounts is the us program business written by sirius america totaling million of gross written premiums and million of net written premiums 
additionally  in late  white mountains re  through folksamerica  entered into the cna re agreement and established a chicago underwriting office 
annual gross written premiums for the underwriting year resulting from this transaction and the related opening of the chicago underwriting office were approximately million  of which million was recorded as gross written premium and million as net written premium for the year ended december  partially offsetting the increases resulting from these transactions was the cancellation of several large casualty treaties at folksamerica whose pricing or terms did not meet white mountains re s underwriting guidelines 
there were significant levels of property catastrophe activity during the last half of  including the four hurricanes which affected the southeast united states and the caribbean  where white mountains re has historically been a significant participant in the property reinsurance market 
additionally  sirius international was exposed to losses from the devastating tsunami that impacted south asia in december white mountains re believes its underwriting discipline and risk management approach helped to contain these losses to manageable levels 
this significant property catastrophe activity during the last half of resulted in million of pre tax losses  including million related to the tsunami 
there was no significant property catastrophe activity in during  white mountains re recorded million of net unfavorable loss reserve development  which contributed point to the loss ratio in  as compared to million  or points in the unfavorable development is described in further detail in the section titled white mountains re results year ended december  versus year ended december   below 
the majority of the unfavorable development recorded in resulted from certain discontinued lines at folksamerica as well as run off operations acquired as part of the sirius acquisition 
this unfavorable development was partially offset by favorable development in the sirius international reserve portfolio  stemming mainly from the three most recent underwriting years  and is indicative of the favorable terms and conditions that have existed in the global reinsurance marketplace during that time 
additionally  white mountains re recorded million of unfavorable loss development on its workers compensation reserves acquired as part of the sierra acquisition in this adverse development was offset dollar for dollar by the adjustable note discussed in note significant transactions 
white mountains re receives fee income on reinsurance placements referred to olympus and is entitled to a profit commission based on net underwriting profits on referred business 
the additional capacity provided by the reinsurance relationship with olympus supports white mountains re s ability to offer significant reinsurance protection 
white mountains re recognized net fee income of million from olympus in as compared to in the decline in the fee income earned is due primarily to the negative impact of the four hurricanes on the profit commission arrangement between white mountains re and olympus 
white mountains re results year ended december  versus year ended december  white mountains re s pretax income was million for  an increase of over the million recorded in white mountains re s gaap combined ratio improved to for  from for the improvement in white mountains re s combined ratio resulted primarily from more favorable terms and conditions in the reinsurance marketplace  and fewer catastrophe losses affecting white mountains re in as compared to white mountains re s gross written premiums increased from to  while net written premiums increased and earned premiums increased 
the increases in net written and earned premiums were due to increased pricing on white mountains re s expiring and renewed contracts  increased shares on renewed contracts and new contracts resulting from the increased demand of reinsurance buyers for placing reinsurance with responsible  well capitalized reinsurers 
white mountains re s total revenues were up in over  primarily driven by a increase in earned premiums 
the increase in earned and net written premiums was due to increased pricing on white mountains re s expiring and renewed contracts  increased shares on renewed contracts and new contracts resulting from the increased demand of reinsurance buyers for placing reinsurance with responsible  well capitalized reinsurers 
also contributing to the increase in revenues in was a million increase million in vs million in in advisory fees and profit commissions received by white mountains re on reinsurance placements referred to olympus  due principally to an increase in the volume of business ceded to olympus in white mountains re experienced approximately million of unfavorable loss reserve development during  primarily due to strengthening of a e reserves and reserves on risk capital casualty lines 
white mountains re s loss development for a e exposures was due to the completion of a detailed a e market share study

esurance s loss ratio improvement resulted from the continued rollout and refinement of esurance s proprietary auto insurance program 
loss ratio improvement also resulted from better claims performance  driven by the transition from a third party administrator to an in house claims operation in  as well as points of favorable development on loss reserves 
the auto program  combined with esurance s self service  web enabled operating platform  allowed esurance to increase premium volume and in force policy count while reducing the expense ratio from to

in this regard  the results of its other operations segment primarily relate to financing activities  purchase accounting adjustments relating to the onebeacon acquisition  gains and losses recognized from the purchase and sale of certain of the company s subsidiaries and other assets and general and administrative expenses incurred at the holding company level 
other operations results year ended december  versus year ended december  white mountains other operations segment reported a pre tax loss of million for  compared to million for the increased loss for the year was primarily due to a million increase in incentive compensation accruals  which were driven by a rise in white mountains stock price during  and higher gains from the sale of real estate in million in and million in 
in addition  interest expense on preferred stock was up million in due to the inclusion of a full year of expense in pre tax income in as opposed to six months included in as a result of the company s adoption of sfas  effective july  prior to the adoption of sfas  the interest expense on preferred stock was classified below the pretax loss line on the income statement as preferred stock dividends

interest expense on debt decreased by million in  due to the pay off of a million loan and the refinancing of million of senior debt and amortization of the previous credit facility 
this decrease was offset by the inclusion of million of interest expense on preferred stock as a result of sfas ii 
summary of investment results investment philosophy white mountains manages all of its consolidated investments through its wholly owned subsidiary  wm advisors 
white mountains investment philosophy is to invest its assets with a view towards maximizing its after tax total return over extended periods of time 
under this approach  each dollar of after tax investment income and realized and unrealized gains and losses is valued equally 
white mountains overall fixed maturity investment strategy is to purchase securities that are attractively priced in relation to perceived credit risks 
white mountains generally manages the interest rate risk associated with holding fixed maturity investments by actively monitoring and maintaining the average duration of the portfolio with the goal of achieving an adequate after tax total return without subjecting the portfolio to an unreasonable level of interest rate risk 
white mountains investment portfolio mix as of december  consisted in large part of high quality  fixed maturity investments and short term investments  as well as some equity investments and limited partnerships 
white mountains management believes that prudent levels of investments in common equity securities and other investments within its investment portfolio are likely to enhance after tax total returns without significantly increasing the risk profile of the portfolio when considered over long periods of time when balanced with leverage and insurance risk considerations 
white mountains seeks to maximize after tax risk adjusted returns over the long term 
investment returns white mountains generated strong investment returns in the gaap total return on invested assets was  while the equity portfolio returned for the year 
the equity return was significantly better than the s p  which returned for the year  while the bond portfolio performed in line with its duration and credit characteristics 
management is continuing to keep its fixed maturity portfolio duration relatively short at about years to reflect its concern that interest rates may rise in the next few years 
net investment income was up from last year mainly due to the sirius acquisition  after declining in primarily due to the decline in reserves at onebeacon as its premium volume was reduced 
white mountains sold a portion of its investment in montpelier common shares during the first quarter of resulting in a million pre tax realized gain and  as a result  changed the method of accounting for its remaining montpelier common shares to the fair value method  resulting in a million increase in after tax unrealized gains in the first quarter 
impairment see note investments of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for white mountains analysis of impairment losses on investment securities 
non gaap financial measures this report includes two non gaap financial measures that have been reconciled to their most comparable gaap financial measures 
white mountains believes these measures to be more relevant than comparable gaap measures in evaluating white mountains financial performance 
adjusted comprehensive net income is a non gaap measure that excludes the change in net unrealized gains from symetra s fixed maturity portfolio from comprehensive net income 
gaap requires these assets to be marked to market  which results in gains during periods when interest rates fall and losses in periods when interest rates rise 
because the liabilities related to the life insurance and structured settlement products that these assets support are not marked to market  it is likely that the economic impact on symetra would be the opposite of that shown under gaap ie  in general  symetra s intrinsic value increases when interest rates rise and decreases when interest rates fall 
the reconciliation of adjusted comprehensive net income to comprehensive net income is included on page book value per share is derived by dividing the company s total gaap shareholders equity as of a given date by the number of common shares outstanding as of that date  including the dilutive effects of outstanding options and warrants to acquire common shares  as well as the unamortized accretion of preferred stock 
fully converted tangible book value per share is a non gaap measure which is derived by expanding the gaap book value per share calculation to include the effects of assumed conversion of all convertible securities and to exclude any unamortized goodwill and net unrealized gains from symetra s fixed maturity portfolio 
the reconciliation of fully converted tangible book value per share to book value per share is included on page liquidity and capital resources operating cash and short term investments holding company level 
the primary sources of cash for the company and certain of its intermediate holding companies are dividends and tax sharing payments received from its insurance and reinsurance operating subsidiaries  financing activities and net investment income and proceeds from sales and maturities of holding company investments 
the primary uses of cash are interest payments on the senior notes  dividend payments on the berkshire and zenith preferred stock as well as on common shares  purchases of investments and holding company operating expenses 
operating subsidiary level 
the primary sources of cash for white mountains insurance and reinsurance operating subsidiaries are premium collections  net investment income and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments 
the primary uses of cash are claim payments  policy acquisition costs  operating expenses  the purchase of investments and dividend and tax sharing payments made to parent holding companies 
both internal and external forces influence white mountains financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
claim settlements  premium levels and investment returns may be impacted by changing rates of inflation and other economic conditions 
in many cases  significant periods of time  ranging up to several years or more  may lapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to white mountains and the settlement of the liability for that loss 
the exact timing of the payment of claims and benefits cannot be predicted with certainty 
white mountains insurance and reinsurance operating subsidiaries maintain portfolios of invested assets with varying maturities and a substantial amount of short term investments to provide adequate cash for the payment of claims 
management believes that white mountains cash balances  cash flows from operations  routine sales of investments and the liquidity provided by its bank facility are adequate to meet expected cash requirements for the foreseeable future on both a holding company and insurance and reinsurance operating subsidiary level 
dividend capacity under the insurance laws of the states and jurisdictions under which white mountains insurance and reinsurance operating subsidiaries are domiciled  an insurer is restricted with respect to the timing or the amount of dividends it may pay without prior approval by regulatory authorities 
accordingly  there can be no assurance regarding the amount of such dividends that may be paid by such subsidiaries in the future 
following is a description of the ability of white mountains insurance and reinsurance operating subsidiaries to pay dividends to the company and certain of its intermediate holding companies onebeacon generally  onebeacon s regulated insurance operating subsidiaries have the ability to pay dividends during any month period without the prior approval of regulatory authorities in an amount equal to the greater of prior year statutory net income or of prior year end statutory surplus  subject to the availability of unassigned funds 
as a result  based on statutory net income  onebeacon s top tier regulated insurance operating subsidiaries have the ability to pay million of dividends during without prior approval of regulatory authorities  subject to the availability of unassigned funds 
as of december   onebeacon s top tier regulated insurance operating subsidiaries had billion of unassigned funds available for dividend distribution 
in addition  as of december   onebeacon had million of cash and investments outside of its regulated insurance operating subsidiaries available for distribution during during  onebeacon paid million of cash dividends to fund american 
white mountains re folksamerica s principal regulated reinsurance operating subsidiary has the ability to pay dividends during any month period without the prior approval of regulatory authorities in an amount equal to the lesser of net investment income  as defined by statute  or of statutory surplus  in both cases as most recently reported to regulatory authorities  subject to the availability of earned surplus 
as a result  based upon december  statutory surplus of million  folksamerica s principal regulated reinsurance operating subsidiary would have the ability to pay approximately million of dividends during without prior approval of regulatory authorities  subject to the availability of earned surplus 
as of december   folksamerica s principal regulated reinsurance operating subsidiary had million of earned surplus  therefore it can pay dividends of million plus additional earned surplus reported during  subject to the million limitation discussed above 
as of december   wmu had million of cash and investments available for distribution during in addition  wmu has the ability to distribute its earnings without restriction 
during  wmu paid million of cash dividends to its immediate parent 
in addition  as of december   white mountains re had approximately million of cash and investments outside of its regulated insurance and reinsurance operating subsidiaries available for distribution during safety reserve in accordance with provisions of swedish law  sirius international can voluntarily transfer its pretax earnings  or a portion thereof  subject to certain limitations  into an untaxed reserve referred to as a safety reserve 
the safety reserve is a swedish regulatory concept that has no equivalent under gaap 
accordingly  under gaap  an amount equal to sirius international s safety reserve of billion at december   net of the related deferred tax liability established at the statutory swedish tax rate of  is classified as equity 
generally  this deferred tax liability is only required to be paid by sirius international if it fails to maintain predetermined levels of premium writings in future years 
as a result of the indefinite deferral of these taxes  swedish regulatory authorities do not apply any taxes to the safety reserve when calculating solvency capital under swedish insurance regulations 
keep well on november   white mountains completed a significant corporate reorganization  through which ownership of folksamerica was transferred to white mountains re from fund american 
in order to effect the reorganization  white mountains and fund american entered into or amended certain agreements with respect to the berkshire preferred stock 
under the terms of a keep well agreement dated november  between white mountains and fund american the keep well  white mountains has agreed to return to fund american up to approximately billion  which equals the amount of net assets transferred out of fund american as a result of the reorganization  if some or all of that amount is required by fund american to meet its obligations to berkshire under the berkshire preferred stock 
additionally  the keep well limits the aggregate amount of distributions that white mountains may make to its shareholders to approximately billion plus white mountains aggregate consolidated net income after september  the keep well will expire when all obligations of the berkshire preferred stock  which is redeemable in may  have been satisfied  or when approximately billion has been returned to fund american 
insurance float insurance float is an important dynamic of white mountains operations that must be managed effectively 
float is money that an insurance company holds for a limited time 
in an insurance operation  float arises because premiums are collected before losses are paid 
this interval can extend over many years 
during that time  the insurer invests the money 
when the premiums that an insurer collects do not cover the losses and expenses it eventually must pay  the result is an underwriting loss  which is considered to be the cost of float 
the amount and cost of float for white mountains is affected by underlying market conditions  as well as acquisitions or dispositions of insurance and reinsurance businesses 
although insurance float can be calculated using numbers determined under gaap  insurance float is not a gaap concept and therefore there is no comparable gaap measure 
one of the means by which white mountains calculates its insurance float is by taking its net investment assets and subtracting its total tangible capital 
the following table illustrates white mountains consolidated insurance float position as of the past five year ends december  in millions total investments     cash investment in unconsolidated insurance affiliate s equity in net unrealized gains from symetra s fixed maturity portfolio accounts receivable on unsettled investment sales accounts payable on unsettled investment purchases interest bearing funds held by ceding companies interest bearing funds held under reinsurance treaties net investment assets     total common shareholders equity    debt  preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption convertible preference shares less unamortized deferred credits and goodwill equity in net unrealized gains from symetra s fixed maturity portfolio total tangible capital     insurance float     insurance float as a multiple of total tangible capital x x x x x net investment assets as a multiple of total tangible capital x x x x x insurance float as a multiple of common shareholders equity x x x x x net investment assets as a multiple of common shareholders equity x x x x x excludes funds held by ceding companies from which white mountains does not receive interest credits and excludes funds held by white mountains under reinsurance treaties for which white mountains does not provide interest credits 
white mountains has historically obtained its float primarily through acquisitions  as opposed to organic growth 
for each of the years in the three year period ending december   white mountains has had negative cash flows from operations but has generated significant float from its insurance and reinsurance operations 
this is due to the fact that white mountains cash flow from operations does not reflect cash and investments generated by the acquisition of insurance and reinsurance businesses in recent years 
post acquisition  such companies are often placed into partial or complete run off  thereby resulting in negative cash flows from operations as the investments acquired are liquidated over time to pay claims 
in the case of onebeacon  the substantial amount of float initially acquired with the onebeacon acquisition has shrunk as a result of onebeacon s re underwriting efforts and the effects of the liberty agreement 
onebeacon s float is expected to continue to shrink during as older  long tailed loss reserves are paid and are not replaced with the same level of current writings as those written in the past 
in the case of white mountains re  its float increased substantially in as a result of the sirius and sierra acquisitions 
white mountains re s float is expected to increase during as a result of higher premium writings from its increased capital base and acquisitions over the past few years 
it is white mountains intention to generate low cost float over time through a combination of acquisitions and or by organic growth in its existing insurance and reinsurance operations 
however  white mountains will seek to increase its float organically only when market conditions allow for an expectation of generating underwriting profits

management believes that white mountains strong financial position provides it with the flexibility and capacity to obtain funds externally as needed through debt or equity financing on both a short term and long term basis 
in may  white mountains reduced its cost of capital and significantly reduced its near term obligations by fully prepaying its previous million amortizing bank facility  principally through the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes  which were issued by fund american through a public offering 
the senior notes bear a fixed annual interest rate of and mature in may in july  white mountains enhanced its access to the capital markets by having a shelf registration declared effective by the sec for offerings of up to billion in debt and or equity securities 
in august  fund american restructured and re syndicated its existing million bank facility to increase the availability under the revolving credit facility to million and to extend the maturity from september to august under the bank facility  for which both fund american and the company are permitted borrowers  the company guarantees all obligations of fund american  and fund american guarantees all borrowings of the company  subject to certain limitations imposed by the terms of the berkshire preferred stock 
as of december   the bank facility was undrawn 
in connection with its acquisition of the sierra group on march   folksamerica entered into a million purchase note the sierra note  million of which will be adjusted over its approximate six year term to reflect favorable or adverse loss reserve development on the acquired reserve portfolio and run off of remaining policies in force mainly workers compensation business as well as certain other balance sheet protections 
during  the sierra note was reduced by million as a result of adverse development on the acquired reserves and run off of unearned premiums 
in connection with its acquisition of atlantic specialty on march   onebeacon issued a million ten year note to the seller the atlantic specialty note 
onebeacon is required to repay million of principal on the notes per year  commencing with the first payment due on january  fund american s senior notes are currently rated baa adequate  the th highest of ratings with a stable outlook by moody s and bbb adequate  the th highest of ratings with a positive outlook by s p and bbb good  the th highest of ratings with a stable outlook by fitch ratings 
it is possible that  in the future  one or more of the rating agencies may lower white mountains existing ratings 
if one or more of its ratings were downgraded  white mountains could incur higher borrowing costs and its ability to access the capital markets could be impacted 
in addition  white mountains insurance and reinsurance operating subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by a downgrade in their financial strength ratings  including a possible reduction in demand for their products in certain markets 
the senior notes were issued under an indenture which contains restrictive covenants that  among other things  limit the ability of the company  fund american and their respective subsidiaries to create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions and substantially limits the ability of fund american and its respective subsidiaries to consolidate  merge or transfer their properties and assets 
the indenture does not contain any financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity to which the company or fund american must adhere 
at december   white mountains was in compliance with all of the covenants under the senior notes  and anticipates it will continue to remain in compliance with these covenants for the foreseeable future 
the bank facility contains various affirmative  negative and financial covenants which white mountains considers to be customary for such borrowings and include maintaining certain minimum net worth and maximum debt to capitalization standards for white mountains 
failure to meet one or more of these covenants could result in an event of default  which ultimately could eliminate availability under the facility and result in acceleration of principal repayment on any amounts outstanding 
at december   white mountains was in compliance with all of the covenants under the bank facility  and anticipates it will continue to remain in compliance with these covenants for the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations and commitments below is a schedule of white mountains material contractual obligations and commitments as of december  millions due in one year or less due in two to three years due in four to five years due after five years total debt mandatorily redeemable preferred stock loss and lae reserves     reserves for structured contracts interest on debt and dividends and accretion on preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption long term incentive compensation operating leases total contractual obligations    represents expected future cash outflows resulting from loss and lae payments 
accordingly  these balances exclude the discount on onebeacon s workers compensation loss and lae reserves of million and the remaining purchase accounting fair value adjustment of million related to the onebeacon and sirius acquisitions as they are non cash items 
further  the amounts presented include reinsurance recoverables recorded of  million 
white mountains loss reserves do not have contractual maturity dates 
however  based on historical payment patterns  the preceding table includes an estimate of when management expects white mountains loss reserves to be paid 
the timing of claim payments is subject to significant uncertainty 
white mountains maintains a portfolio of marketable investments with varying maturities and a substantial amount of short term investments to provide adequate cash flows for the payment of claims 
the balances included in the table above regarding white mountains long term incentive compensation plans include amounts payable for performance shares and units  as well as deferred compensation balances 
exact amounts to be paid cannot be predicted  for performance shares  with certainty  as the ultimate amounts of these liabilities are based on future performance of the company and the market price of common shares at the time the payments are made 
the estimated payments reflected in the table are based on current accrual factors common share price and pay out percentage and assume that all outstanding balances were vested as of december  there are no provisions within white mountains leasing agreements that would trigger acceleration of future lease payments 
white mountains does not finance its operations through the securitization of its trade receivables  through special purpose entities or through synthetic leases 
further  white mountains has not entered into any material arrangement requiring it to guarantee payment of third party debt  lease payments or to fund losses of an unconsolidated special purpose entity  except as noted in the following paragraph 
through sirius international  white mountains has a long term investment as a stockholder in luc holdings  an entity that has entered into a head lease to rent the london underwriting center luc through luc holdings in turn subleases space in the luc 
in the luc holdings stockholders agreement  the stockholders have guaranteed any shortfall between the head lease and the sub leases on a joint and several basis 
as a consequence  in recent years the stockholders have funded an operating shortfall of luc 
at december   white mountains has recorded a liability of million for its share of the expected future shortfall between luc holdings head lease payments and sub lease receipts 
white mountains does not believe that future shortfalls  if any  will have a material impact on its results of operations 
white mountains also has future binding commitments to fund certain limited partnership investments 
these commitments  which total approximately million  do not have fixed funding dates and are therefore excluded from the table above

critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the financial statements presented herein include all adjustments considered necessary by management to fairly present the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of white mountains 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in the current year presentation of financial information  certain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation 
white mountains has completed numerous significant transactions during the periods presented that have affected the comparability of the financial statement information presented herein 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to loss and lae reserves  purchase accounting  reinsurance estimates and its pension benefit obligations 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management believes that its critical accounting policies affect its more significant estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the descriptions below are summarized and have been simplified for clarity 
loss and loss adjustment expenses onebeacon non asbestos and environmental reserves onebeacon establishes loss and lae reserves that are estimates of amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses in the future for insured events that have already occurred 
the process of estimating reserves involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and  as of any given date  is inherently uncertain 
reserves are typically comprised of case reserves for claims reported and reserves for losses that have occurred but for which claims have not yet been reported  referred to as incurred but not reported ibnr reserves  which include a provision for expected future development on case reserves 
case reserves are estimated based on the experience and knowledge of claims staff regarding the nature and potential cost of each claim and are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made 
ibnr reserves are derived by subtracting paid loss and lae and case reserves from estimates of ultimate loss and lae 
actuaries estimate ultimate loss and lae using various generally accepted actuarial methods applied to known losses and other relevant information 
like case reserves  ibnr reserves are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made 
ultimate loss and lae are generally determined by extrapolation of claim emergence and settlement patterns observed in the past that can reasonably be expected to persist into the future 
in forecasting ultimate loss and lae with respect to any line of business  past experience with respect to that line of business is the primary resource  but cannot be relied upon in isolation 
onebeacon s own experience  particularly claims development experience  such as trends in case reserves  payments on and closings of claims  as well as changes in business mix and coverage limits  is the most important information for estimating its reserves 
external data  available from organizations such as statistical bureaus  consulting firms and reinsurance companies  is sometimes used to supplement or corroborate onebeacon s own experience  and can be especially useful for estimating costs of new business 
for some lines of business  such as long tail coverages discussed below  claims data reported in the most recent accident year is often too limited to provide a meaningful basis for analysis due to the typical delay in reporting of claims 
for this type of business  onebeacon uses a selected loss ratio method for the initial accident year or years 
this is a standard and accepted actuarial reserve estimation method in these circumstances in which the loss ratio is selected based upon information used in pricing policies for that line of business  as well as any publicly available industry data  such as industry pricing  experience and trends  for that line of business 
uncertainties in estimating ultimate loss and lae are magnified by the time lag between when a claim actually occurs and when it is reported and settled 
this time lag is sometimes referred to as the claim tail 
the claim tail for most property coverages is typically short usually a few days up to a few months 
the claim tail for liability casualty coverages  such as automobile liability  general liability  products liability  multiple peril coverage  and workers compensation  can be especially long as claims are often reported and ultimately paid or settled years  even decades  after the related loss events occur 
during the long claims reporting and settlement period  additional facts regarding coverages written in prior accident years  as well as about actual claims and trends may become known and  as a result  onebeacon may adjust its reserves 
if management determines that an adjustment is appropriate  the adjustment is booked in the accounting period in which such determination is made in accordance with gaap 
accordingly  should reserves need to be increased or decreased in the future from amounts currently established  future results of operations would be negatively or positively impacted  respectively 
in determining ultimate loss and lae  the cost to indemnify claimants  provide needed legal defense and other services for insureds and administer the investigation and adjustment of claims are considered 
these claim costs are influenced by many factors that change over time  such as expanded coverage definitions as a result of new court decisions  inflation in costs to repair or replace damaged property  inflation in the cost of medical services and legislated changes in statutory benefits  as well as by the particular  unique facts that pertain to each claim 
as a result  the rate at which claims arose in the past and the costs to settle them may not always be representative of what will occur in the future 
the factors influencing changes in claim costs are often difficult to isolate or quantify and developments in paid and incurred losses from historical trends are frequently subject to multiple and conflicting interpretations 
changes in coverage terms or claims handling practices may also cause future experience and or development patterns to vary from the past 
a key objective of actuaries in developing estimates of ultimate loss and lae  and resulting ibnr reserves  is to identify aberrations and systemic changes occurring within historical experience and accurately adjust for them so that the future can be projected reliably 
because of the factors previously discussed  this process requires the use of informed judgment and is inherently uncertain 
onebeacon s actuaries use several generally accepted actuarial methods to evaluate its loss reserves  each of which has its own strengths and weaknesses 
onebeacon places more or less reliance on a particular method based on the facts and circumstances at the time the reserve estimates are made 
these methods generally fall into one of the following categories or are hybrids of one or more of the following categories historical paid loss development methods these methods use historical loss payments over discrete periods of time to estimate future losses 
historical paid loss development methods assume that the ratio of losses paid in one period to losses paid in an earlier period will remain constant 
these methods necessarily assume that factors that have affected paid losses in the past  such as inflation or the effects of litigation  will remain constant in the future 
because historical paid loss development methods do not use case reserves to estimate ultimate losses  they can be more reliable than the other methods discussed below that look to case reserves such as actuarial methods that use incurred losses in situations where there are significant changes in how case reserves are established by a company s claims adjusters 
however  historical paid loss development methods are more leveraged meaning that small changes in payments have a larger impact on estimates of ultimate losses than actuarial methods that use incurred losses because cumulative loss payments take much longer to equal the expected ultimate losses than cumulative incurred amounts 
in addition  and for similar reasons  historical paid loss development methods are often slow to react to situations when new or different factors arise than those that have affected paid losses in the past 
historical incurred loss development methods these methods  like historical paid loss development methods  assume that the ratio of losses in one period to losses in an earlier period will remain constant in the future 
however  instead of using paid losses  these methods use incurred losses ie  the sum of cumulative historical loss payments plus outstanding case reserves over discrete periods of time to estimate future losses 
historical incurred loss development methods can be preferable to historical paid loss development methods because they explicitly take into account open cases and the claims adjusters evaluations of the cost to settle all known claims 
however  historical incurred loss development methods necessarily assume that case reserving practices are consistently applied over time 
therefore  when there have been significant changes in how case reserves are established  using incurred loss data to project ultimate losses can be less reliable than other methods 
expected loss ratio methods these methods are based on the assumption that ultimate losses vary proportionately with premiums 
expected loss ratios are typically developed based upon the information used in pricing  and are multiplied by the total amount of premiums written to calculate ultimate losses 
expected loss ratio methods are useful for estimating ultimate losses in the early years of long tailed lines of business  when little or no paid or incurred loss information is available 
adjusted historical paid and incurred loss development methods these methods take traditional historical paid and incurred loss development methods and adjust them for the estimated impact of changes from the past in factors such as inflation  the speed of claim payments or the adequacy of case reserves 
adjusted historical paid and incurred loss development methods are often more reliable methods of predicting ultimate losses in periods of significant change  provided the actuaries can develop methods to reasonably quantify the impact of changes 
construction defect claims onebeacon s general liability and multiple peril lines of business have been significantly impacted by an increasing number of construction defect claims 
construction defect is a liability allegation relating to defective work performed in the construction of structures such as apartments  condominiums  single family dwellings or other housing  as well as the sale of defective building materials 
such claims seek recovery due to damage caused by alleged deficient construction techniques or workmanship 
much of the increase in claims activity has been generated by plaintiffs lawyers who approach new homeowners  and in many cases homeowner associations with large numbers of homeowners in multi residential complexes  about defects or other flaws in their homes 
the increasing number of claims for construction defects began with claims relating to exposures in california 
then  as plaintiffs lawyers organized suits in other states with high levels of multi residential construction  construction defect claims were reported in nearby western states  such as colorado and nevada  and eventually throughout the country 
the reporting of such claims can be quite delayed as the statute of limitations can be up to ten years 
court decisions have expanded insurers exposure to construction defect claims as well 
for example  in california courts adopted a continuous trigger theory in which all companies that had ever insured a property that was alleged to have been damaged by defective construction must respond to the claimant  even if evidence of the alleged damage did not appear until after the insurance period had expired 
as a result  claims may be reported more than ten years after a project has been completed as litigation can proceed for several years before an insurance company is identified as a potential contributor 
recently  claims have also emerged from parties claiming additional insured status on policies issued to other parties eg  such as contractors seeking coverage on a sub contractor s policy 
a large number of construction defect claims have been identified relating to coverages that onebeacon had written in the past through commercial union and general accident and their subsidiaries in california  colorado  nevada  washington and oregon 
management has sought to mitigate future construction defect risks in all states by no longer providing insurance to certain residential general contractors and sub contractors involved in multi habitational projects 
mitigating actions also included initiating the withdrawal from problematic sub segments within onebeacon s construction book of business  such as street and road construction  water  sewer and pipeline construction  and dam  waterway  railroad and subway construction 
management has undertaken actions to mitigate future risks related to construction defect claims and believes that the number of reported construction defect claims relating to coverages written in the past peaked in and will begin to decline 
in addition  in reserving for these claims  there is additional uncertainty due to the potential for further unfavorable judicial rulings and regulatory actions 
asbestos and environmental a e reserves onebeacon s reserves include provisions made for claims that assert damages from a e related exposures 
asbestos claims relate primarily to injuries asserted by those who came in contact with asbestos or products containing asbestos 
environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean up cost obligations  particularly as mandated by federal and state environmental protection agencies 
in addition to the factors described above under non asbestos and environmental reserves regarding the reserving process  onebeacon estimates its a e reserves based upon  among other factors  facts surrounding reported cases and exposures to claims  such as policy limits and deductibles  current law  past and projected claim activity and past settlement values for similar claims  as well as analysis of industry studies and events  such as recent settlements and asbestos related bankruptcies 
the cost of administering a e claims  which is an important factor in estimating loss reserves  tends to be higher than in the case of non a e claims due to the higher legal costs typically associated with a e claims 
due to the inherent difficulties in estimating ultimate a e exposures  onebeacon does not estimate a range for a e incurred losses 
onebeacon s a e losses resulted primarily from the operations of the employers group  an entity acquired by one of the legacy companies in these operations  including business of employers surplus lines insurance company and employers liability assurance corporation  provided primary and excess liability insurance for commercial insureds  including fortune sized accounts  some of whom subsequently experienced claims for a e losses 
onebeacon stopped writing such coverage in onebeacon s liabilities for a e losses from business underwritten in the recent past are substantially limited by the application of exclusionary clauses in the policy language that eliminated coverage of such claims 
after for pollution and for asbestos  most liability policies contained industry standard absolute exclusions of such claims 
in earlier years  various exclusions were also applied  but the wording of those exclusions was less strict and subsequent court rulings have reduced their effectiveness 
onebeacon also incurred a e losses via its participation in industry pools and associations 
the most significant of these pools was excess casualty reinsurance association ecra  which provided excess liability reinsurance to us insurers from until the early s 
ecra incurred significant liabilities for a e  of which onebeacon bears approximately a share  or million at december  compared to million at december   which is fully reflected in onebeacon s loss and lae reserves 
more recently  since the s  onebeacon has experienced an influx of claims from commercial insureds  including many non fortune sized accounts written during the s and s  who are named as defendants in asbestos lawsuits 
as a number of large well known manufacturers of asbestos and asbestos containing products have gone into bankruptcy  plaintiffs have sought recoveries from peripheral defendants  such as installers  transporters or sellers of such products  or from owners of premises on which the plaintiffs exposure to asbestos allegedly occurred 
at december   policyholders had asbestos related claims against onebeacon 
in  new insureds with such peripheral involvement presented asbestos claims under prior onebeacon policies 
historically  most asbestos claims have been asserted as product liability claims 
recently  insureds who have exhausted the available products liability limits of their insurance policies have sought payment for asbestos claims under the premises and operations coverage of their liability policies 
it is more difficult for plaintiffs to establish losses as stemming from premises and operations exposures  which requires proof of the defendant s negligence  rather than products liability under which strict legal liability applies 
hence  there are fewer of such claims and there is a great deal of variation in damages awarded for the actual injuries 
additionally  several accounts that seek such coverage find that previously paid losses exhausted the aggregate limits under their policies 
in these situations there is no coverage for these claims 
there are currently active claims against onebeacon without product liability coverage asserting operations or premises coverage 
immediately prior to white mountains acquisition of onebeacon  onebeacon purchased a reinsurance contract with nico under which onebeacon is entitled to recover from nico up to billion in the future for asbestos claims arising from business written by onebeacon in and prior  environmental claims arising from business written by onebeacon in and prior  and certain other exposures 
under the terms of the nico cover  nico receives the economic benefit of reinsurance recoverables from certain of onebeacon s third party reinsurers in existence at the time the nico cover was executed third party recoverables 
as a result  the third party recoverables serve to protect the billion limit of nico coverage for the benefit of onebeacon 
any amounts uncollectible from third party reinsurers due to dispute or the reinsurers financial inability to pay are covered by nico under its agreement with onebeacon 
third party recoverables are typically for the amount of loss in excess of a stated level each year 
of claim payments in the past years  approximately of asbestos losses and of environmental losses have been recovered under the historical third party reinsurance 
onebeacon estimates that on an incurred basis it has exhausted approximately billion of the coverage provided by nico at december  at december   million of the billion of exhausted coverage from nico related to uncollectible third party recoverables 
net losses paid totaled approximately million as of december   with million paid in asbestos payments during reflect payments resulting from intensified efforts by claimants to resolve asbestos claims prior to enactment of potential federal asbestos legislation 
to the extent that onebeacon s estimate of ultimate a e losses as well as the estimate and collectibility of third party recoverables differs from actual experience  the remaining protection under the nico cover may be more or less than the approximate million that onebeacon estimates remained at december  for purposes of determining available reinsurance  product liability asbestos claims typically are aggregated as a single loss within each policy period 
as a result  losses often exceed the retention level under the reinsurance agreement and reinsurance recoveries are obtained 
however  for claims being asserted under premises and operations coverage  the losses are generally not aggregated for purposes of determining reinsurance recoveries  so onebeacon expects that in the future a smaller percentage of these losses will be covered as third party recoverables than has been true historically of products liability asbestos losses 
onebeacon s reserves for a e losses  net of third party recoverables but prior to nico recoveries  are billion at december  an industry benchmark of reserve adequacy is the survival ratio  computed as a company s reserves divided by its historical average yearly loss payments 
this ratio indicates approximately how many more years of payments the reserves can support  assuming future yearly payments are equal to historical levels 
onebeacon s survival ratio was approximately at december   which was computed as the ratio of a e reserves  net of third party recoverables  of billion plus the remaining unused portion of the nico cover of million  to the average loss payments in the past three years 
the average loss payments used to calculate onebeacon s survival ratio were net of a large commutation million in with a third party reinsurer 
white mountains believes that as a result of the nico cover and its historical third party reinsurance programs  onebeacon should not experience material financial loss from old a e exposures under current coverage interpretations and that its survival ratio compares favorably to industry survival ratios 
onebeacon s reserves for a e losses at december  represent management s best estimate of its ultimate liability based on information currently available 
onebeacon believes the nico cover will be adequate to cover all of its a e obligations 
however  as case law expands  medical and clean up costs increase and industry settlement practices change  onebeacon may be subject to asbestos and environmental losses beyond currently estimated amounts 
therefore  onebeacon cannot guarantee that its a e loss reserves  plus the remaining coverage under the nico cover  will be sufficient to cover additional liability arising from any such unfavorable developments

the following table shows the recorded reserves and the high and low ends of onebeacon s range of reasonable loss reserve estimates at december  the high and low ends of onebeacon s range of reserve estimates in the table below are based on the results of various actuarial methods described above 
the recorded reserve for each line is the result of the actuarial method that management believes to be most appropriate based on known facts and trends 
december  onebeacon net loss and lae reserves by line of business range and recorded reserves low recorded high in millions workers compensation personal automobile liability multiple peril commercial automobile liability general liability homeowners farmowners other total    the probability that ultimate losses will fall outside of the ranges of estimates by line of business is higher for each line of business individually than it is for the sum of the estimates for all lines taken together due to the effects of diversification 
although management believes onebeacon s reserves are reasonably stated  ultimate losses may deviate  perhaps materially  from the recorded reserve amounts and could be above the high end of the range of actuarial projections 
the recorded reserves represent management s best estimate of unpaid loss and lae by line of business 
in its selection of recorded reserves  management has generally given greater weight to adjusted paid loss development methods  which are not dependent on the consistency of case reserving practices  rather than methods that rely on incurred losses  because of the increased adequacy of case reserving by onebeacon s claim staff in the recent past 
for multiple peril this resulted in onebeacon recording reserves nearer the low end of the range 
for some types of claims  such as workers compensation and construction defect  management also considered special purpose forecasting models that its claims and actuarial staff have created that consider the unique loss development characteristics of these types of claims 
for personal automobile liability  homeowners and other principally shorter tailed lines of business such as ocean and inland marine insurance recorded reserves remain rather high in the respective ranges  as management s selections reflect a conservative approach to recognition of recent favorable development experienced in our ongoing businesses 
white mountains re white mountains re a e reserves white mountains re has a specialized unit that handles claims emanating from a e exposures 
the issues presented by these types of claims require specialization  expertise and an awareness of the various trends and jurisdictional developments 
white mountains re s a e exposure is primarily from reinsurance contracts written between through by predecessor companies mony reinsurance and christiania general 
the exposures are predominately higher layer excess of loss treaty and facultative coverages with relatively low limits exposed for each claim 
net incurred loss activity for asbestos and environmental in the last two years was as follows december  net incurred loss and lae activity in millions asbestos environmental 
total in recent years  most of white mountains re s reported activity in the asbestos area has related to higher layer excess policies that are being reached by larger target defendants  new notices for smaller regional defendants that are now exposed because of the larger defendant bankruptcies  and new notices on premises and non products cases  where coverage is being sought by insureds against the non aggregating portion of the underlying policy 
wm re expects to see a smaller percentage of these losses exceed the retention level under reinsurance agreements 
approximately million of white mountains re s loss development for asbestos exposures was a bulk increase in ibnr resulting from the completion of a detailed a e market share study 
this study compared white mountains re s share of industry paid losses to estimated industry carried reserves 
white mountains re sets up claim files for each reported claim by each cedent for each individual insured 
in many instances  a single claim notification from a cedent could involve several years and layers of coverage resulting in a file being set up for each involvement 
precautionary claim notices are submitted by the ceding companies in order to preserve their right to pursue coverage under the reinsurance contract 
such notices do not contain an incurred loss amount to white mountains re  accordingly  an open claim file is not established 
as of december   white mountains re had approximately  open claim files for asbestos and open claim files for environmental exposures 
the costs associated with administering the underlying a e claims by white mountains re s clients tend to be higher than non a e claims due to generally higher legal costs incurred by ceding companies in connection with a e claims ceded to white mountains re under the reinsurance contracts 
white mountains re a e claims activity white mountains re s a e claim activity for the last two years is illustrated in the table below

the estimation of net reinsurance loss and lae reserves is subject to the same risk as the estimation of insurance loss and lae reserves 
in addition to those risk factors which give rise to inherent uncertainties in establishing insurance loss and lae reserves  the inherent uncertainties of estimating such reserves are even greater for the reinsurer  due primarily to the claim tail for reinsurers being further extended because claims are first reported to the ceding company and then through one or more intermediary insurers or reinsurers  the diversity of loss development patterns among different types of reinsurance treaties or facultative contracts  the necessary reliance on the ceding companies for information regarding reported claims and the differing reserving practices among ceding companies 
as with insurance reserves  the process of estimating reinsurance reserves involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and  as of any given date  is inherently uncertain 
based on the above  such uncertainty may be larger relative to the reserve for a reinsurer compared to an insurance company  and may take a longer time to emerge 
in order to reduce the potential uncertainty of loss reserve estimation  white mountains re obtains information from numerous sources to assist in the process 
white mountains re s pricing actuaries devote considerable effort to understanding and analyzing a ceding company s operations and loss history during the underwriting of the business  using a combination of ceding company and industry statistics 
such statistics normally include historical premium and loss data by class of business  individual claim information for larger claims  distributions of insurance limits provided  loss reporting and payment patterns  and rate change history 
this analysis is used to project expected loss ratios for each treaty during the upcoming contract period 
these expected ultimate loss ratios are aggregated across all treaties and are input directly into the loss reserving process to generate the expected loss ratios that are used to estimate ibnr 
upon notification of a loss from a ceding company  white mountains re establishes case reserves  including lae reserves  based upon white mountains re s share of the amount of reserves established by the ceding company and our independent evaluation of the loss 
in cases where available information indicates that reserves established by the ceding company are inadequate  white mountains re establishes case reserves or ibnr in excess of its share of the reserves established by the ceding company 
in addition  specific claim information reported by ceding companies or obtained through claim audits can alert us to emerging trends such as changing legal interpretations of coverage and liability  claims from unexpected sources or classes of business  and significant changes in the frequency or severity of individual claims 
such information is often used to supplement estimates of ibnr 
as mentioned above  there can be a considerable time lag from the time a claim is reported to a ceding company to the time it is reported to the reinsurer 
the lag can be several years in some cases 
this lag can be due to a number of reasons  including the time it takes to investigate a claim  delays associated with the litigation process  the deterioration in a claimant s physical condition many years after an accident occurs  etc 
in its loss reserving process  white mountains re assumes that such lags are predictable  on average  over time and therefore the lags are contemplated in the loss reporting patterns used in its actuarial methods 
this means that  as a reinsurer  white mountains re must rely on such actuarial estimates for a longer period of time after reserves are first estimated than does a primary insurance company 
backlogs in the recording of assumed reinsurance can also complicate the accuracy of loss reserve estimation 
as of december   there were no significant backlogs related to the processing of assumed reinsurance information at white mountains re 
white mountains re relies heavily on information reported by ceding companies  as discussed above 
in order to determine the accuracy and completeness of such information  white mountains re s us underwriters  actuaries  and claims personnel perform regular audits of folksamerica s ceding companies 
while regular ceding company audits are not customary outside the united states  sirius international s staff regularly reviews information from ceding companies for unusual or unexpected results 
any material findings are discussed with the ceding companies 
white mountains re sometimes encounters situations where we determine that a claim presentation from a ceding company is not in accordance with contract terms 
in these situations  white mountains re attempts to resolve the dispute directly with the ceding company 
most situations are resolved amicably and without the need for litigation or arbitration 
however  in the infrequent situations where a resolution is not possible  white mountains re will vigorously defend our position in such disputes 
although loss and lae reserves are initially determined based on underwriting and pricing analysis  white mountains re constantly tests the accuracy of reserves using a variety of generally accepted actuarial methods  including historical incurred and paid loss development methods 
if actual loss activity differs substantially from expectations based on historical information  an adjustment to loss reserves may be warranted 
as time passes  loss reserve estimates for a given accident year will rely more on actual loss activity and historical patterns than on initial assumptions based on pricing indications 
white mountains re also obtain reinsurance whereby another reinsurer contractually agrees to indemnify white mountains re for all or a portion of the reinsurance risks underwritten by white mountains re 
such arrangements  where one reinsurer provides reinsurance to another reinsurer  are usually referred to as retrocessional reinsurance arrangements 
white mountains re establishes estimates of amounts recoverable from retrocessional reinsurance in a manner consistent with the loss and lae liability associated with reinsurance contracts offered to its customers the ceding companies  net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts  if any 
net reinsurance loss reserves represent loss and lae reserves reduced by retrocessional reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses 
white mountains re s net loss and lae reserves by class of business at december  and were as follows december  december  net loss and lae reserves by class of business in millions case ibnr total case ibnr total liability excluding a e  property accident health and other a e total     white mountains re establishes loss reserves based on a single point estimate  which is management s best estimate of ultimate losses and loss expenses 
this best estimate is derived from a combination of methods as described above 
once a point estimate is established  white mountains re s actuaries estimate loss reserve ranges to measure the sensitivity of the actuarial assumptions used to set the point estimates 
these ranges are calculated using similar methods to the point estimate calculation  but with different expected loss ratio and loss reporting pattern assumptions 
for the low estimate  more optimistic loss ratios and faster reporting patterns are assumed  while the high estimate uses more conservative loss ratios and slower reporting patterns 
these variable assumptions are derived from historical variations in loss ratios and reporting patterns by class and type of business 
due to the inherent difficulties in estimating ultimate a e exposures  white mountains re does not estimate ranges for these reserves 
the growth in reserves from to was driven by acquisitions made during the following table illustrates white mountains re s recorded net loss and lae reserves and high and low estimates for those classes of business for which a range is calculated  at december  december  net loss and lae reserves by class of business in millions low recorded high liability excluding a e    property accident health and other sub total    a e total  the probability that ultimate losses will fall outside of the ranges of estimates by class of business is higher for each class of business individually than it is for the sum of the estimates for all classes taken together due to the effects of diversification 
although management believes reserves for white mountains re are reasonably stated  ultimate losses may deviate  perhaps materially  from the recorded reserve amounts and could be above the high end of the range of actuarial projections 
white mountains re reinsurance estimates there is a time lag from the point when premium and related commission and expense activity is recorded by a ceding company to the point when such information is reported by the ceding company  through its reinsurance intermediary  to white mountains re 
this time lag can vary from one to several contractual reporting periods ie quarterly monthly 
this lag is common in the broker market reinsurance business 
as a result of this time lag in reporting  white mountains re estimates a portion of its written premium and related commissions and expenses 
given the nature of white mountains re s business  estimated premium balances  net of related commissions and expenses  comprise a large portion of total premium balances receivable 
the estimation process begins by identifying which major accounts have not reported activity at the most recent period end 
in general  premium estimates for excess of loss business are based on minimum deposit information included in the contractual terms 
for proportional business  white mountains re s estimates are derived based on a variety of factors and assumptions  including prior reporting from the broker or ceding company  historical reporting patterns  expected premium volume based on contractual terms or ceding company reports and other correspondence and communication with underwriters  brokers  intermediaries and ceding companies 
once premium estimates are determined  related commission and expense estimates are derived using contractual terms 
white mountains re closely monitors its estimation process on a quarterly basis and adjusts its estimates as more information and actual amounts become known 
there is no assurance that the amounts estimated by white mountains re will not deviate from the amounts reported by the ceding company or reinsurance broker 
any such deviations are reflected in the results of operations when they become known 
the following table summarizes white mountains re s premium estimates and related commissions and expenses december  millions liability property accident health other total gross premium estimates net premium estimates net commission and expense estimates net amount included in reinsurance balances receivable december  millions liability property accident health other total gross premium estimates net premium estimates net commission and expense estimates net amount included in reinsurance balances receivable the net amounts recorded in reinsurance balances receivable may not yet be due from the ceding company at the time of the estimate since actual reporting from the ceding company has not yet occurred 
therefore  based on the process described above  white mountains re believes all of its estimated balances are collectible  and as such no allowance has been recorded 
reinsurance transactions white mountains insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries purchase reinsurance from time to time to protect their businesses from losses due to exposure aggregation  to manage their operating leverage ratios and to limit ultimate losses arising from catastrophic events 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liability associated with the reinsured policies 
amounts related to reinsurance contracts are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short duration and long duration contracts sfas 
the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables is subject to the solvency and willingness to pay of the reinsurer 
the company is selective in choosing its reinsurers  placing reinsurance principally with those reinsurers with a strong financial condition  industry ratings and underwriting ability 
management monitors the financial condition and ratings of its reinsurers on an ongoing basis

pension and post retirement medical plans white mountains accounts for its pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas and accounts for its retiree medical plan in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas 
sfas and sfas require that the cost of pension retiree medical benefits be accrued over the period during which an employee provides service 
the majority of onebeacon s pension and retiree medical plans were curtailed in the fourth quarter of the onebeacon pension plan no longer adds new participants or increases benefits for existing participants 
non vested participants already in the plan continue to vest during their employment with onebeacon 
retirees are also eligible for medical benefits if they meet certain age and service requirements 
however  due to the curtailment  the plan no longer accepts new participants 
the majority of retiree medical costs are capped at defined dollar amounts  with retirees contributing the remainder 
the projected benefit obligation as of a particular date represents the actuarial present value of all benefits attributed by the plan s benefit formula to employee service rendered prior to that date 
therefore  future cash payments from pension and retiree medical plans are discounted using a discount rate based on published investment grade  long term corporate bond yields 
many of the factors which are used to determine a plan s projected benefit obligation as of a particular date and the cost of pension retiree medical benefits for a particular period are dependent upon future events  such as how long the employee and any survivors live  how many years of service the employee is expected to render and the employee s compensation in the years immediately before retirement or termination 
accordingly  the effects of such future factors are estimated 
further  since the projected benefit obligation and the periodic cost of pension retiree medical benefits are based on actuarial present values  they are also sensitive to changes in the discount rate used to determine such amounts 
a hypothetical increase in the discount rate would result in a decrease in pension and retiree medical projected benefit obligations of approximately million 
a hypothetical decrease in the discount rate would result in an increase in pension and retiree medical projected benefit obligations of approximately million 
the impact of a hypothetical change to the discount rate on periodic cost of pension retiree medical benefits is not significant 
additionally  the rate of return that is assumed on plan assets affects onebeacon s pension expense during a particular period 
since the retiree medical plan is unfunded  it is not affected by changes in the rate of return assumption 
onebeacon performed an analysis of expected long term rates of return based on the allocation of its pension plan assets as of both december  and december  to develop expected rates of return for each significant asset class or economic indicator 
a range of returns was developed based both on forecasts and on broad market historical benchmarks for expected return  correlation  and volatility for each asset class 
although the expected investment return assumption is long term in nature  the range of reasonable returns has dropped over the past few years as a consequence of lower inflation and lower bond yields 
as a result of the most recent review  for onebeacon elected to keep the expected return on its pension assets at  as was used in at december   of plan assets were invested in fixed maturity securities  in equities and the remainder in cash  cash equivalents and convertible securities 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return would result in a pretax change in onebeacon s pension expense or income as the case may be for of approximately million 
during  onebeacon recognized pension expense of million  which was comprised of net periodic benefit cost of 
million and special termination benefits of million 
included in the net periodic benefit cost is million of expected return on pension plan assets 
onebeacon contributed million to the pension plan in no unrecognized losses on pension assets were recorded since the company uses the market value method to value plan assets 
purchase accounting when white mountains acquires another company  management must estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired  as prescribed by sfas no 
 business combinations sfas 
certain assets and liabilities require little judgment to estimate their fair values  particularly those that are quoted on a market exchange  such as publicly traded investment securities 
other assets and liabilities  however  require a substantial amount of judgment to estimate their fair values 
the most significant of these is the estimation required to fair value loss and lae reserves 
white mountains estimates the fair value of loss and lae reserves obtained in an acquisition following the principles contained within fasb statement of financial accounting concepts no 
using cash flow information and present value in accounting measurements con 
under con  the fair value of a particular asset or liability essentially contains five elements an estimate of the future cash flows  expectations about possible variations in the amount or timing of those cash flows  the time value of money  represented by the risk free rate of interest  the price for bearing the uncertainty inherent in the asset or liability  and other  sometimes unidentifiable  factors including illiquidity and market imperfections 
white mountains actuaries estimate the fair value of loss and lae reserves obtained in an acquisition by taking the acquired company s recorded reserves and discounting them based on expected reserve payout patterns using the current risk free rate of interest 
then  white mountains actuaries develop additional cash flow scenarios that use different payout and ultimate reserve assumptions deemed to be reasonably possible based upon the inherent uncertainties present in determining the amount and timing of payment of such reserves 
in each scenario  the risk free rate of interest is used to discount future cash flows 
these scenarios are put in a statistical model that assigns a probability to each cash flow scenario 
white mountains actuaries then choose the scenario that best represents the price for bearing the uncertainty inherent within the acquired company s recorded reserves 
the price for bearing the uncertainty inherent within the acquired company s reserves is measured as the difference between the selected cash flow scenario and the expected cash flow scenario 
the scenario selected has typically been between and standard deviations from the expected cash flow outcome 
the fair value of the acquired company s loss and lae reserves is determined to be the sum of the expected cash flow scenario ie  the acquired company s discounted loss and lae reserves and the uncertainty price 
the difference between an acquired company s loss and lae reserves and white mountains best estimate of the fair value of such reserves at the acquisition date is amortized ratably over the payout period of the acquired loss and lae reserves 
historically  the fair value of an acquired company s loss and lae reserves has been less than the it s recorded reserves at acquisition 
accordingly  the amortization has been and will continue to be recorded as an expense on white mountains income statement until fully amortized 
forward looking statements the information contained in this report may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of all statements  other than statements of historical facts  included or referenced in this report which address activities  events or developments which white mountains expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward looking statements 
the words will  believe  intend  expect  anticipate  project  estimate  predict and similar expressions are also intended to identify forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements include  among others  statements with respect to white mountains growth in book value per share or return on equity  business strategy  financial and operating targets or plans  incurred losses and the adequacy of its loss and lae reserves  projections of revenues  income or loss  earnings or loss per share  dividends  market share or other financial forecasts  expansion and growth of its business and operations  and future capital expenditures 
these statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by white mountains in light of its experience and perception of historical trends  current conditions and expected future developments  as well as other factors believed to be appropriate in the circumstances 
however  whether actual results and developments will conform with its expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations  including claims arising from catastrophic events  such as hurricanes  earthquakes  floods or terrorist attacks  the continued availability of capital and financing  general economic  market or business conditions  business opportunities or lack thereof that may be presented to it and pursued  competitive forces  including the conduct of other property and casualty insurers and reinsurers  changes in domestic or foreign laws or regulations applicable to white mountains  its competitors or its clients  an economic downturn or other economic conditions adversely affecting its financial position  loss reserves established subsequently proving to have been inadequate  and other factors  most of which are beyond white mountains control 
consequently  all of the forward looking statements made in this report are qualified by these cautionary statements  and there can be no assurance that the actual results or developments anticipated by white mountains will be realized or  even if substantially realized  that they will have the expected consequences to  or effects on  white mountains or its business or operations 
white mountains assumes no obligation to update publicly any such forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk white mountains consolidated balance sheet includes a substantial amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risk 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and other relevant market rates and prices 
due to white mountains sizable balances of interest rate sensitive instruments  market risk can have a significant effect on white mountains consolidated financial position 
interest rate risk fixed maturity portfolio 
in connection with the company s consolidated insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries  white mountains invests in interest rate sensitive securities  primarily debt securities 
white mountains strategy is to purchase fixed maturity investments that are attractively priced in relation to perceived credit risks 
white mountains fixed maturity investments are held as available for sale in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas  whereby these investments are carried at fair value on the balance sheet with net unrealized gains or losses reported net of tax in a separate component of common shareholders equity 
white mountains generally manages its interest rate risk associated with its portfolio of fixed maturity investments by monitoring the average duration of the portfolio  which allows white mountains to achieve an adequate yield without subjecting the portfolio to an unreasonable level of interest rate risk 
white mountains fixed maturity portfolio is comprised of primarily investment grade corporate securities  us government and agency securities  municipal obligations and mortgage backed securities eg  those receiving an investment grade rating from s p or moody s 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of fixed maturity investments  respectively 
additionally  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the credit worthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
the table below summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in market interest rates on white mountains fixed maturity portfolio and pension plan 
in millions fair value at december  assumed change in relevant interest rate estimated fair value after change in interest rate after tax increase decrease in carrying value fixed maturity investments  bp decrease  bp decrease  bp increase  bp increase  pension fixed maturity investments bp decrease bp decrease bp increase bp increase long term obligations 
as of december   white mountains interest and dividend bearing long term obligations consisted primarily of the senior notes and the berkshire and zenith preferred stock obligations  which have fixed interest and dividend rates 
as a result  white mountains exposure to interest rate risk resulting from variable interest rate obligations is insignificant 
the senior notes were issued in and mature on may  at december   the fair value of white mountains senior notes was approximately million  which compared to a carrying value of million 
the berkshire and zenith preferred stock obligations were issued in and mature on may  and may   respectively 
at the company s option  the zenith preferred stock may be redeemed on june  at december   the fair values of the berkshire and zenith preferred stock were approximately million and million  respectively  which compared to carrying values of million and million  respectively 
the fair values of these obligations were estimated by discounting future cash flows using current market rates for similar obligations or using quoted market prices 
equity price risk the carrying values of white mountains common equity securities and its other investments are based on quoted market prices or management s estimates of fair value which is based  in part  on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet date 
market prices of common equity securities  in general  are subject to fluctuations which could cause the amount to be realized upon sale or exercise of the instruments to differ significantly from the current reported value 
the fluctuations may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee  the relative price of alternative investments  general market conditions and supply and demand imbalances for a particular security 
foreign currency exchange rates white mountains foreign assets and liabilities are valued using period end exchange rates and its foreign revenues and expenses are valued using average exchange rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that white mountains will incur losses on a us dollar basis due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   onebeacon held approximately million in bonds denominated in foreign currencies  mostly those denominated in british pounds 
assuming a hypothetical increase or decrease in the rate of exchange from the british pound to the us dollar as of december   the carrying value of onebeacon s foreign currency denominated bond portfolio would have respectively decreased or increased by approximately million 
as a result of the sirius acquisition during  white mountains has a higher concentration of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies than in prior periods 
the functional currency of sirius international is the swedish krona 
assuming a hypothetical increase or decrease in the rate of exchange from the swedish krona to the us dollar as of december   the carrying value of white mountains net assets denominated in swedish kronor would have respectively decreased or increased by approximately million
