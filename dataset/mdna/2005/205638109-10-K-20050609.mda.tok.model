included in these reclassifications are income tax reserves totaling million  million  million and million at march    and  respectively  that have been reclassified from long term deferred taxes to accrued expenses which thereby resulted in a corresponding increase in deferred tax assets 
these reclassifications do not have any impact on net income and are immaterial to the financial statements overall 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements this discussion contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws which are identified by the use of the words believes  expects  anticipates  will  contemplates  would and similar expressions that contemplate future events 
numerous important factors  risks and uncertainties affect our operating results  including  without limitation  those discussed below  and contained elsewhere in this report  and could cause actual results to differ materially from the results implied by these or any other forward looking statements made by us  or on our behalf 
there can be no assurance that future results will meet expectations 
while we believe that our forward looking statements are reasonable  you should not place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date made 
except as required by applicable law  we do not undertake any obligation to publicly release any revisions which may be made to any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this report 
while we are expanding our focus on distributed software products  a majority of our revenue from software products is dependent on our customers continued use of ibm and ibm compatible mainframe products and on the acceptance of our pricing structure for software licenses and maintenance 
the pricing of our software licenses and maintenance is under constant pressure from customers and competitive vendors 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future with respect to current and future products or that any such assertion may not require us to enter into royalty arrangements or result in costly litigation 
our operating margins may decline 
we are aware that operating expenses associated with our distributed systems products are higher than those associated with our traditional mainframe products 
since we believe the best opportunities for revenue growth are in the distributed systems market  product operating margins could experience more pressure 
in addition  operating margins in the professional services business are significantly impacted by small fluctuations in revenue since most costs are fixed during any short term period 
our results could be adversely affected by increased competition and pricing pressures 
we consider over firms to be directly competitive with one or more of our products 
these competitors include but are not limited to bmc software  inc  borland software corp  computer associates international  inc  ibm  mercury interactive corporation and niku corporation 
some of these competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  recruiting and training resources than we do 
the market for professional services is highly competitive  fragmented and characterized by low barriers to entry 
our principal competitors in professional services include but are not limited to accenture ltd  computer sciences corporation  electronic data systems corporation  ibm global services  analysts international corporation  keane  inc  infosys technologies and numerous other regional and local firms in the markets in which we have professional services offices 
several of these competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  recruiting and training resources than we do 
our success depends in part on our ability to develop or acquire product enhancements and new products that keep pace with continuing changes in technology and customer preferences 
approximately of our total revenue is derived from foreign sources 
this exposes us to exchange rate risks on foreign currencies and to other international risks such as the need to comply with foreign and us export laws  and the uncertainty of certain foreign economies 
we regard our software as proprietary and attempt to protect it with copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws and or restrictions on disclosure  copying and transferring title 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
we depend on key employees and technical personnel 
the loss of certain key employees or our inability to attract and retain other qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our quarterly financial results vary and may be adversely affected by certain relatively fixed costs 
our product revenues vary from quarter to quarter 
net income may be disproportionately affected by a fluctuation in revenues because only a small portion of our expenses varies with revenues 
historical seasonality in license revenue cannot be relied on as an indicator of future performance due to the current economic conditions affecting the it industry and to the varying structure of customer arrangements and the associated revenue recognition requirements 
changes in world economies could cause customers to further delay or forego decisions to license new products or upgrades to their existing environments or to reduce their requirements for professional services  and this could adversely affect our operating results 
acts of terrorism  acts of war and other unforeseen events may cause damage or disruption to our properties  employees  suppliers  distributors  resellers and customers which could adversely affect our business and operating results 
overview in this section  we discuss our results of operations on a segment basis for each of our financial reporting segments 
we operate in two business segments in the technology industry products and professional services 
we evaluate segment performance based primarily on segment contribution before corporate expenses 
references to years are to fiscal years ended march this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
we provide software products and professional services designed to increase the productivity of the it departments of businesses worldwide 
in the early years of our company  we focused on offering professional services and mainframe products in the testing and implementation environment where we gained extensive experience and established long term customer relationships 
over the past several years  we have expanded our products and professional services offerings to remain competitive in the it market 
we focus on growing revenue and profit margins by enhancing and promoting our current product lines  expanding our product and service offerings through key acquisitions  developing strategic partnerships in order to provide clients with our product solutions and managing our costs 
the following occurred since the beginning of fiscal entered into a software  services and technology relationship with ibm and settled all outstanding litigation between the companies 
according to the agreement  ibm will enter into license and maintenance arrangements for million of our software over four years and offer to purchase million of our services over four years 
acquired changepoint in may changepoint offerings provide cios with insight and visibility into their people  projects  resources and applications  helping cios align it investments with business priorities 
acquired adlex  incorporated adlex in may adlex has pioneered service delivery management technology that enables internet service providers and enterprise customers to diagnose and then manage the quality of service that business critical applications deliver to end users 
this technology complements the compuware vantage product line by providing extremely high capacity  agentless end user experience monitoring and deep insight into application performance 
acquired the technology assets of devstream corporation devstream  based in colorado springs  colorado 
the privately owned software company developed an advanced jee performance analysis product  which we recently introduced as vantage analyzer for jee 
released mainframe and distributed products  during fiscal  designed to increase the productivity of the it departments of our customers 
achieved a products contribution margin of in fiscal compared to in fiscal achieved a distributed product revenue increase of in fiscal compared to fiscal approximately of the increase was a reflection of our continued focus on promoting our distributed products with the remainder attributable to the changepoint acquisition in the first quarter of improved the professional services margin to in fiscal from in fiscal through improved utilization of professional services personnel and  to a lesser extent  a concerted effort to reduce low margin subcontractor arrangements 
our ability to achieve our strategies and objectives is subject to a number of factors some of which we may not be able to control 
see forward looking statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain operational data from the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues and the percentage change in such items compared to the prior period percentage of period to period total revenues change fiscal year ended march  to to revenue software license fees maintenance fees professional services fees total revenues operating expenses cost of software license fees cost of professional services technology development and support sales and marketing administrative and general total operating expenses income from operations other income income before income taxes income tax provision net income software products revenue our products are designed to support the complete application lifecycle development and integration  quality assurance  production readiness and performance management of the application to optimize performance in production

product revenue which consists of software license fees and maintenance fees  comprised  and of total revenue during  and  respectively 
distributed software product revenue increased million or during to million from million in and increased million or during from million in the increased revenue during was primarily due to an increase of million in maintenance revenue related to our devpartner and vantage product lines and to the addition of million related to changepoint  which was acquired during the first quarter of the increased revenue during was primarily due to an increase in license and maintenance revenue related to our vantage product lines 
mainframe software product revenue decreased  or during to million from million in and decreased million or during from million in the decreased revenue during was primarily due to a decrease in license and maintenance revenue related to our file aid and abend aid product lines 
license revenue increased million or during to million from million in and increased  or during from million in license revenue increased million compared to due to fluctuations in foreign currencies 
excluding the favorable effect of foreign currency fluctuations  license revenue decreased during the decrease  net of currency fluctuations  was primarily due to a reduction in devpartner license revenue offset by the addition of changepoint as discussed above 
maintenance fees increased million or to million during from million in and decreased million or during from million in maintenance fees increased million compared to due to fluctuations in foreign currencies 
excluding the favorable effect of foreign currency fluctuations  maintenance fees increased during the increased maintenance revenue in was primarily a result of revenue growth in our distributed product lines and to the addition of changepoint as discussed above 
we license software to customers using two types of software licenses  perpetual and term 
generally  perpetual software licenses allow customers a perpetual right to run our software on hardware up to a licensed aggregate mips millions of instructions per second capacity or to run our distributed software for a specified number of users or servers 
term licenses allow customers a right to run our software for a limited period of time on hardware up to a licensed aggregate mips capacity 
also  our customers purchase maintenance services that provide technical support and advice  including problem resolution services and assistance in product installation  error corrections and any product enhancements released during the maintenance period 
furthermore  based on customers business needs  customers are allowed to license additional software and purchase multiple years of maintenance in a single transaction multi year transactions 
in support of these multi year transactions  we allow extended payment terms to qualifying customers 
to recognize revenue for these multi year transactions the contract price is allocated between maintenance revenue and license revenue 
all license revenue associated with perpetual license agreements is recognized when the customer commits unconditionally to the transaction  the software products and quantities are fixed  the software has been shipped to the customer and collection is reasonably probable 
license revenue associated with term transactions or with transactions that include an option to exchange or select products in the future is deferred and recognized over the term of the agreement 
when the license portion is paid over a number of years  the license portion of the payment stream is discounted to its net present value 
interest income is recognized over the payment term 
the maintenance revenue associated with all sales is deferred and is recognized over the applicable maintenance period 
product revenue by geographic location is presented in the table below in thousands year ended march  united states    europe and africa    other international operations    total product revenue    product contribution and expenses financial information for the product segment is as follows in thousands year ended march  revenue    expenses    product contribution    the product segment generated contribution margins of  and during  and  respectively 
product expenses include cost of software license fees  technology development and support costs  and sales and marketing expenses 
these factors are discussed below 
cost of software license fees includes amortization of capitalized software  the cost of duplicating and disseminating products to customers and the cost of author royalties 
as a percentage of software license fees  cost of software license fees were  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in cost of software license fees for was primarily attributable to a reduction in amortization expense related to capitalized software acquired as a result of the programart acquisition that became fully amortized in september technology development and support includes  primarily  the costs of programming personnel associated with product development and support excluding the amount of software development costs capitalized during the period 
also included here are personnel costs associated with developing and maintaining internal systems and hardware software costs required to support technology initiatives 
as a percentage of product revenue  costs of technology development and support were  and in  and  respectively 
capitalization of internally developed software products begins when technological feasibility of the product is established 
before the capitalization of internally developed software products  total technology development and support expenditures during decreased million or  to million from million in and increased million or during from million in the decrease in technology costs for was primarily attributable to lower compensation and benefit costs of approximately million due to reductions in employee headcount in this area which occurred during the third and fourth quarters of the increase in technology costs for was primarily attributable to higher compensation  benefit and bonus costs of approximately million offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of approximately million 
compensation  benefit and bonus costs were higher due to scheduled salary increases during and higher employee headcount in this area which increased by to an average headcount of  people during depreciation expense declined due to approximately million of computer equipment becoming fully depreciated in the first and second quarters of a portion of the increase was offset by cost reduction strategies implemented in october that resulted in a reduction of technology development and support costs totaling million during the third and fourth quarters of sales and marketing costs consist primarily of personnel related costs associated with product direct sales and sales support  marketing for all our offerings  and personnel costs associated with new sales initiatives 
sales and marketing costs increased million or  during to million from million in and increased million or during from million in as a percentage of product revenue  sales and marketing costs were  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in sales and marketing costs for was primarily attributable to higher compensation and benefit costs and an increase in marketing seminar costs related to the ojx seminar that was held at our detroit world headquarters in september to promote our optimalj product line 
compensation and benefit costs were higher due to scheduled salary increases during and the negative effect of foreign currency fluctuations on these costs as the us dollar continued to weaken throughout approximately of total sales and marketing compensation and benefits were attributable to our foreign operations 
the increase in sales and marketing costs for was primarily attributable to higher salary and benefit costs of approximately million  increased commission and bonus costs of approximately million and higher advertising costs of approximately million 
compensation  benefit  commission and bonus costs were higher due to salary increases during  higher employee headcount in this area which increased by to an average headcount of  people during and the negative effect of foreign currency fluctuations on these costs as the us dollar continued to weaken throughout approximately of total sales and marketing compensation  benefit  commission and bonus costs were attributable to our foreign operations 
the change in advertising costs was a result of increases in the promotion of our products in the distributed software marketplace during in late october  we implemented cost reduction strategies that resulted in a reduction of sales and marketing costs totaling million during the third and fourth quarters of in april  the company realigned the sales organization and eliminated a layer of management with the intention of improving communication channels in deal strategy  execution  forecasting and closing 
the realignment will reduce headcount and is expected to lower salaries and benefits by approximately million during  offset by severance and other implementation costs associated with the realignment totaling approximately million during the first two quarters of professional services revenue we offer a broad range of it services to help businesses make the most of their it assets 
some of these services include outsourcing and co sourcing  application management  product solutions  project management  enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management services  and our unique compuware application reliability solution  a comprehensive approach to application quality assurance 
revenue from professional services decreased million or during to million from million in and decreased million or during from million in the decrease in revenue for and was primarily due to a reduction in demand for professional services as customers continue to postpone large projects  continued downward pressure on our billing rates due to the highly competitive nature of the professional services market and a reduction in subcontractor arrangements  along with a strategic move away from non core professional services such as helpdesk  computer operations and non technical project management 
as we move forward  we are focusing on higher margin project development services and combined product and services solution arrangements 
professional services revenue by geographic location is presented in the table below in thousands year ended march  united states    europe and africa    other international operations    total professional services revenue    professional services contribution and expenses financial information for the professional services segment is as follows in thousands year ended march  revenue    expenses    professional services contribution    during  the professional services segment generated a contribution margin of  compared to and during and  respectively 
the increase from to was primarily due to improved utilization of professional services personnel and  to a lesser extent  a concerted effort to reduce low margin subcontractor projects 
cost of professional services consists primarily of personnel related costs of providing services  including billable staff  subcontractors and sales personnel 
cost of professional services decreased million or  during to million from million in and decreased million or during from million in the decrease in cost of professional services for was primarily attributable to lower compensation  benefit  bonus and travel costs of approximately million and a decrease in subcontractor costs of approximately million 
compensation  benefit  bonus and travel costs were lower due to an reduction in average employee headcount in this area to  people during the decrease in cost of professional services for was primarily attributable to lower compensation  benefit  bonus and travel costs of approximately million and a decrease in subcontractor costs of approximately million 
compensation  benefit  bonus and travel costs were lower due to a reduction in average employee headcount in this area to  people during in late october  we implemented cost reduction strategies that resulted in a reduction of professional services costs totaling million during the third and fourth quarters of corporate and other expenses administrative and general expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the corporate executive  finance  human resources  administrative  legal and corporate communications departments 
in addition  administrative and general expenses include all facility related costs  such as rent  building depreciation  maintenance  utilities  etc  associated with all of our locations 
administrative and general expenses decreased million or  during to million from million in and increased million or during from million in the decrease in administrative and general expenses for was primarily attributable to a decrease in legal fees of approximately million due to reduced legal costs associated with the ibm litigation offset by an increase in charitable contributions of million  increase in compensation and benefits of million due to scheduled salary increases and higher depreciation expense associated with the detroit headquarters building of approximately million 
the increase in administrative and general expenses for was primarily attributable to an increase in legal fees of approximately million and higher depreciation expense associated with the detroit headquarters building of approximately million 
in late october  we implemented cost reduction strategies that resulted in a reduction to administrative and general costs totaling million during the third and fourth quarters of external legal fees for all litigation  including ibm and other matters were million  million and million in  and litigation expense was impacted significantly over the last three fiscal years by the ibm litigation 
in march  we entered into a software  services and technology relationship with ibm and settled all outstanding litigation between the companies 
with the settlement of the ibm litigation  we anticipate that legal costs should decline significantly in compared to the last three fiscal years  barring any unforeseen litigation claims against us 
other income consists primarily of interest earnings on deferred customer receivables  interest income realized from investments and income losses generated from our investments in partially owned companies 
other income for was million compared to million in and million in income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach 
deferred income taxes are provided for the differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
the income tax provision was million  million and million  respectively  in  and which represents an effective tax rate of  and  respectively 
during the quarter ended december   we adjusted our reserves related to various tax matters 
this adjustment resulted in an income tax benefit of million relating primarily to favorable tax settlements with the us internal revenue service irs and developments in other tax matters both in the us and other taxing jurisdictions 
we recorded a net benefit of million related to the completion of an irs exam which challenged the deductibility of interest paid on corporate owned life insurance coli policies 
we entered into a closing agreement with the irs on this matter in october all coli policies have been cancelled 
the balance of the adjustment related to revisions in estimates for reserves related to the us research and experimentation tax credit  an audit of our australian operations for fiscal years through  and other income tax reserves no longer deemed necessary 
excluding the million tax benefit  the effective tax rate for was 
the effective income tax rates for and are below the statutory rate due to the impact of certain tax benefits discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report 
we expect changes in pre tax net income and in the domestic foreign composition of revenue to change the relative effect of these tax benefits and to result in an increase in the effective income tax rate for fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate from to  excluding the million income tax benefit  is primarily due to the higher percentage impact of certain tax benefit items as a result of the decline in income 
restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of  we adopted a restructuring plan to reorganize our operating divisions  primarily the professional services segment 
these changes were designed to increase profitability by better aligning cost structures with current market conditions 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report  for changes in the restructuring accrual for  and management s discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report  contains a summary of our significant accounting policies 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
assumptions and estimates were based on facts and circumstances existing at march  however  future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
the accounting policies discussed below are considered by management to be the most important to an understanding of our financial statements  because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition a basic criteria for revenue recognition is that collectibility is reasonably assured 
we evaluate collectibility based on past customer history  external credit ratings and payment terms within various customer agreements 
future events or inaccuracies in reported credit data that result in a change to collectibility expectations could have a negative effect on our operating results 
perpetual license fee revenue is recognized using the residual method  under which the fair value  based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of all undelivered elements of the agreement eg maintenance and professional services is deferred 
vsoe is based on rates charged for maintenance and professional services when sold separately 
based on market conditions  we periodically change pricing methodologies for license  maintenance and professional services 
changes in rates charged for stand alone maintenance and professional services could have an impact on how bundled revenue agreements are characterized as license  maintenance or professional services and therefore  on the timing of revenue recognition in the future 
pricing modifications made during the years covered by this report have not had a significant impact on the timing or characterization of revenue recognized 
we have an increasing need for flexibility in licensing rights and offerings to our customers 
as our contractual arrangements evolve to meet the needs of our customers  an increasing percentage of our license arrangements must be recognized over the terms of the arrangement 
while this ratable recognition has no impact on our results over time  it may change the timing of forecasted revenue and impact quarterly results 
generally  revenues from license and maintenance transactions that include installment payment terms are recognized in the same manner as those requiring current payment 
this is because we have an established business practice of offering installment payment terms to customers and have a history of successfully enforcing original payment terms without making concessions 
however  because a significant portion of our license fee revenue is earned in connection with installment sales  changes in future economic conditions or technological developments could adversely affect our ability to immediately record license fees for these types of transactions and or limit our ability to collect these receivables 
professional services fees professional services fees are generally based on hourly or daily rates 
however  for services rendered under fixed price contracts  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method 
unforeseen events that result in additional time or costs being required to complete such projects could affect the timing of revenue recognition for the balance of the project as well as services margins going forward  and could have a negative effect on our results of operations 
based on our interpretation of us gaap including statement of position software revenue recognition and modifications of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin and emerging issues task force issue revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we believe our revenue has been properly reported 
new interpretations or pronouncements related to software revenue recognition policies could result in changes to our method of revenue recognition in the future 
allowance for doubtful accounts the collectibility of accounts receivable is regularly evaluated and we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate for our accounts receivable balances 
in evaluating the allowance  we consider historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and the aging of outstanding receivables 
larger accounts are reviewed on a detail basis  giving consideration to collection experience and any information on the financial viability of the customer 
the allowance is reviewed and adjusted each quarter based on the best information available at the time 
unforeseen events which negatively affect the ability of our customers to meet their payment obligations would negatively impact our ability to collect outstanding amounts due from customers and may cause a material impact on our financial position and results of operations due to a change in the assumptions and judgment on which we base this estimate 
capitalized software the cost of purchased and internally developed software is capitalized and stated at the lower of unamortized cost or expected net realizable value 
we compute annual amortization using the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the software product which is generally five years 
software is subject to rapid technological obsolescence and future product revenue estimates supporting the capitalized software cost can be negatively affected based upon competitive products and pricing 
such adverse developments could reduce the estimated net realizable value of our capitalized software and could result in impairment or a shorter estimated life 
such events would require us to take a charge in the period in which the event occurred or to increase the amortization expense in future periods and would have a negative effect on our results of operations 
impairment of goodwill we are required to assess the impairment of goodwill annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may exceed the fair value 
to analyze goodwill  we measure its fair value using an estimate of the related business s discounted cash flow 
the discounted cash flow approach uses significant assumptions  including projected future cash flows  the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  and a terminal growth rate 
the fair value of the reporting unit including the goodwill is then compared to the carrying value of each reporting unit products and professional services 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  the impairment loss is recognized as an operating expense in an amount equal to that excess 
changes in any of these estimates and assumptions  and unknown future events or circumstances eg economic conditions or technological developments  could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge 
investments in partially owned companies as discussed in note of the notes of consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report  we have minority investments in and advances to certain privately held companies for strategic purposes 
at march   the net carrying value of our investments and advances to these entities totaled million 
additionally  we have guaranteed outstanding lease obligations of million at march  we regularly evaluate the financial condition of these partially owned companies to assess potential impairment in the carrying value of our investments in and advances to these entities 
we consider their current financial situation  including their ability to meet current cash requirements  expected future cash flows and any other information known to us in determining whether an impairment charge is appropriate 
unknown factors or unforeseen events that impair their ability to pay their obligations or to operate profitably could have an impact on our ability to recoup our investments in and outstanding advances to these companies and could require us to expense all or a portion of the outstanding investments and advances in that period 
deferred tax assets valuation allowance and tax liabilities we estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  net deferred tax assets based on expected future taxable benefits in such jurisdictions and our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
for additional information regarding these estimates see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report 
changes in estimates of projected future operating results or in assumptions regarding our ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible could result in significant changes to these accruals and  therefore  to our net income 
in addition  we recognize contingent tax liabilities through tax expense for estimated exposures related to our current tax positions 
we evaluate the need for contingent tax liabilities on a quarterly basis and any change in the amount will be recorded in our results of operations  as appropriate 
it could take several years to resolve certain of these contingencies 
other other accounting policies  although not generally subject to the same level of estimation as those discussed above  are nonetheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
many assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses require some degree of estimation or judgment in determining the appropriate accounting 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   cash and cash equivalents and investments totaled approximately million 
during and  cash flow from operations was million and million  respectively 
during these periods  capital expenditures for the detroit headquarters facility totaled million and million  respectively  and capital expenditures for other property and equipment and capitalized research and software development totaled million and million  respectively 
we hold a million revolving credit facility maturing on july  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report  for a description of the facility 
no borrowings have occurred under this facility 
during fiscal  we implemented a plan to market and sell the former headquarters building in farmington hills  michigan 
the building is classified in current assets as held for sale 
we evaluated whether the current carrying value of the building was impaired and  based on an independent appraisal of the building  concluded that no impairment charge should be recorded at march  on may   the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
our purchases of stock may occur on the open market  through negotiated or block transactions based upon market and business conditions 
there were no purchases under this program during approximately million remains for future purchases under this program 
in may  the company acquired privately held adlex  incorporated  a technology development company  for approximately million in cash 
the acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  assets and liabilities acquired will be recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date 
during fiscal  we acquired changepoint and devstream for approximately million and estimated future payments of million 
during fiscal  we acquired certain assets of covisint llc for approximately million in cash and liabilities assumed 
for more information about these acquisitions  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report 
we continue to evaluate business acquisition opportunities that fit our strategic plans 
we believe available cash resources  together with cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to meet cash needs for the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations and our other commercial commitments as of march  in thousands payment due by period as of march  and total thereafter contractual obligations operating leases        other   total        other includes million of commitments to various detroit area charities and a million advertising agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report  we have guaranteed lease obligations of caretech of up to million 
we have not recorded any liability related to these guarantees since we believe that caretech will continue to meet its obligations 
at march   caretech s outstanding lease obligations were approximately million 
we currently do not have any non consolidated special purpose entity arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed primarily to market risks associated with movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we believe that we take the necessary steps to appropriately reduce the potential impact of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures on our financial position and operating performance 
we do not use derivative financial instruments or forward foreign exchange contracts for investment  speculative or trading purposes 
immediate changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates discussed in the following paragraphs are hypothetical rate scenarios used to calibrate risk and do not currently represent management s view of future market developments 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report 
interest rate risk exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash investments and installment receivables 
derivative financial instruments are not a part of our investment strategy 
investments are placed with high quality issuers to preserve invested funds by limiting default and market risk 
in addition  marketable debt securities and long term debt investments are classified as held to maturity or as available for sale which does not expose the consolidated statements of operations to fluctuations in interest rates 
the table below provides information about our investment portfolio 
for investment securities  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates in thousands  except interest rate year ended march  fair value at total march  cash equivalents    average interest rate investments     average interest rate average interest rate tax equivalent we offer financing arrangements with installment payment terms in connection with our multi year software sales 
installment accounts are generally receivable over a two to five year period 
as of march   non current accounts receivable amounted to million  and are due approximately million  million  million  million and  in each of the years ending march  through  respectively 
the fair value of non current accounts receivable is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rate at which the company would finance a similar transaction 
at march   the fair value of such receivables is approximately million 
each basis point increase in interest rates would have an associated  and  negative impact on the fair value of non current accounts receivable based on the balance of such receivables at march  and  respectively 
a change in interest rates will have no impact on cash flows or net income associated with non current accounts receivable 
foreign currency risk we have entered into forward foreign exchange contracts primarily to hedge amounts due to or from select subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies mainly in europe and asia pacific against fluctuations in exchange rates 
our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of the contracts as hedging transactions 
the criteria we use for designating a contract as a hedge include the contract s effectiveness in risk reduction and one to one matching of derivative instruments to underlying transactions 
gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts are recognized in income  offsetting foreign exchange gains or losses on the foreign balances being hedged 
if the underlying hedged transaction is terminated earlier than initially anticipated  the offsetting gain or loss on the related forward foreign exchange contract would be recognized in income in the same period 
in addition  since we enter into forward contracts only as a hedge  any change in currency rates would not result in any material net gain or loss  as any gain or loss on the underlying foreign currency denominated balance would be offset by the gain or loss on the forward contract 
we operate in certain countries in latin america and asia pacific where there are limited forward currency exchange markets and thus we have unhedged transaction exposures in these currencies
