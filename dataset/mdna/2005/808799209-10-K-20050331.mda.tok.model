item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of that are based on our management s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management 
forward looking statements include  but are not limited to statements regarding future results of operations  including statements regarding sales mix  cost of sales  investment in research and development activities  promotion of our products  trends in our operating expenses and provision for income taxes business strategies  including expansion into new products  categories or countries financing plans  including the adequacy of financial resources to meet future needs  industry environment  including relationships with significant customers and suppliers  the impact on our business and financial results of past and future acquisitions we frequently identify our forward looking statements by the use of words such as may  will  should  potential  continue  expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  and estimates forward looking statements involve many risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements for a number of reasons  including those appearing under the caption factors that may affect future results and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
except as required by law we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements after the date of this report 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition the company has product and services sales 
during the years ended december  and  product and services sales represented and of sales  respectively 
the company has sales to oem s and distributors 
during the years ended december  and  million  or of sales and million or of our sales were sold to distributors  respectively 
revenue from product sales to oem s and distributors is recognized upon shipment when shipped fob our plant or upon receipt by the customer when shipped fob destination  if a signed purchase order exists  the price is fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is considered reasonably assured and product returns can be reasonably estimated 
subsequent to the sale of the products  we have no obligation to provide any modification or customization  upgrades  enhancements or post contract customer support 
our agreements with our distributors include certain product rotation  price protection  and warranty rights 
all distributors have the right to rotate slow moving products four times each fiscal year 
the maximum dollar value of inventory eligible for rotation is equal to eight percent of our products purchased by the distributor during the previous fiscal year 
in order to take advantage of their product rotation rights  the distributors must order and take delivery of additional products equal to at least the dollar value of the products that they want to rotate 
reserves for the right of return and restocking are established based on the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards sfas  revenue recognition when right of return exists because we have visibility into our distributor s inventory and have sufficient history to estimate returns 
we record a reserve based on historical trend 
stock rotation and returns estimates are recorded as reductions of sales and cost of sales 
each distributor is also allowed certain rebates and price protection rights 
if and when we reduce or plan to reduce the price of any of our products and the distributor is holding any of the affected products in inventory  we will credit the distributor the difference in price when it places its next order with us 
we record an allowance for price protection reducing our net sales and increasing our accrued liabilities based on specific terms and historical trend 
price protection estimates are recorded as reductions of sales and warranty estimates are recorded against cost of sales 
the company provides a warranty to its customers for a period of to months 
upon revenue recognition  we provide for the estimated costs that may be incurred for product warranties 
we estimate sales returns and warranty costs based on historical experience and the best information we have at the time we report our financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
warranty expenses are recorded against cost of sales 
installation and engineering service revenue is recognized when services are rendered  or when an identifiable portion of the contract is completed  no significant post delivery obligations exist and collection of the resulting receivable is considered reasonably assured 
service revenue was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the years ended december  and  million or of sales and million or of sales were to distributors  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for estimated losses from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we had in the past 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of our customers could have an adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
an account is written off or written down to its net realizable value  when we determine that and it is in bankruptcy  liquidation or cannot be located or the cost of collection exceeds the realizable value of the account 
inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and may write down excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our historical consumption and our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
in addition  our industry is characterized by technological change  new product development  and product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
our estimates of future product demand may differ from actual results  in which case we may adjust the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such reduced value in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of goods sold in previous periods and will not recognize such additional operating income until the time of sale 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
valuation of goodwill and other long lived assets we review the recoverability of our long lived assets  such as fixed assets  goodwill  intangible assets and investments  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected future pre tax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the related operations 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value 
the measurement of impairment requires management to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of long termed assets 
in addition  we review the valuation of goodwill at least annually 
during  we reviewed the financial forecasts and budgets for msd  lundahl instruments and psi tronix 
due to reduced revenue and margin levels  we determined that approximately million of the book value of the msd intangibles was not recoverable and recorded an impairment charge for this amount to reduce the msd intangibles to their fair value 
based on a review of the expected cash flow versus the current book value of the assets related to the lundahl acquisition  we determined that an impairment charge for the lundahl reporting unit was not necessary 
based on our review of the cash flows related to the psi tronix acquisition  we determined that a significant portion of these intangible assets was not recoverable and determined that an impairment charge of million was required 
we believe that while the technology  customer lists  and product lines still have value  the prolonged downturn in the semiconductor market for our products made it unlikely that we would recover the book value of the assets 
results of operations scientific technologies incorporated designs  manufactures and distributes electrical and electronic industrial controls such as machine safety and automation sensing products 
our product lines include safety light curtains  safety interlock switches  safety relays  profiling scanners  factory automation sensors  controls  fiber optics  power monitoring  safety mats  safety contact strips  non contact ultrasonic sensors and controllers  pressure transducers and other electronic equipment supplied to industrial automation  commercial and defense customers 
we are organized into two product groups  safety products and automation products  within two business segments 
the two units maintain separate operating facilities  engineering and support organizations  which help provide more customer centralized sales  product knowledge and application expertise directed at the unique needs of these focused markets 
this organizational structure was initiated in to allow us to better target our products based on each group s area of specialization  customer focused applications and products 
the safety products group is influenced by separate  but related market forces the demand for increased factory automation and the need for workplace safety 
the market pressures of workplace safety include financial issues  such as workers compensation and product liability insurance expenses as well as the safety regulatory forces of osha  local health and safety codes and international safety standards experienced by global customers 
during  we experience a positive influence by these market forces  as the safety market experienced overall growth 
however  we have also experienced an increased number of companies entering the machine safety market as well  making for a more competitive market environment 
our automation products group provides tailored measurement  instrumentation and sensing solutions for a range of industrial markets 
with the increasing price of oil experienced during the past several years  and the prospects for continued oil demand strong  the oil and gas markets  specifically the exploration and production sector  has become a primary market for apg during this past year 
the group is also focused on the water and wastewater market  with its maturing infrastructure as a sector that may create future opportunities for our pressure  level and instrumentation products 
however  the semiconductor equipment sector has declined further this past year as a market for our pressure sensors 
sales the company is organized into two product groups the safety products group spg and the automation products group apg 
group sales for the years ended december   and were in thousands spg apg sales in increased to million from million in sales by spg increased million or from to this was primarily the result of increased unit sales at the optical sensor division 
shipments of safety light curtains  interlocks and safety mats grew by   and  respectively  offsetting a decline in sales of vehicle scanners 
during  apg sales increased to million  primarily due to increased sales of level sensing products that offset declines of and in sales of ultrasonic and pressure products respectively 
sales in increased to million from million in sales by spg increased million or from to  as a result of increases of in shipments of safety light curtains  in shipments of profiling scanner products  in interlock and relay shipments and in safety mat sales 
in addition  spg s machine services division msd recorded a increase in revenue 
sales by apg grew million or due to increases of  and in shipments of level products  control components and pressure products  respectively 
the table below summarizes operating costs and expenses as a percentage of sales for the most recent three years 
sales gross margin operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development amortization of intangibles total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income  net income loss before taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss gross profit million million million decrease in increase in our gross profit decreased to million in from million in this decrease reflected a decline in our gross margin to of sales in compared to of sales in this was primarily the result of impairment charges of million relating to technology and product lines associated with our acquisitions of msd and psi tronix 
in addition  both spg and apg experienced a shift in the mix of products sold to those bearing a higher relative cost and were impacted by changes made to our inventory reserves 
our gross profit in increased over  due to the increased sales 
this trend was reflected in the results recorded by both spg and apg 
our gross margin was of sales in compared to of sales in  as a result of a shift in the mix of products sold to those bearing a higher relative cost 
selling  general and administrative expenses million million million increase in increase in selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million or in compared to the increase was primarily due to impairment charges of million relating to customer lists and trade names associated with our acquisitions of msd and psi tronix and a  settlement of a commission lawsuit with a former sales representative organization selling  general and administrative expenses were of sales in and compared to of sales in selling general and administrative expenses increased million or in compared to this was primarily the result of higher marketing and selling costs associated with the expanded revenue 
in addition  apg recorded  in expenses relating to the consolidation of the bulk of our tulare  california operations into our logan  utah facility 
this consolidation was essentially completed in  with the exception of one small operation  which we expect to relocate in research and development expenses million million million decrease in decrease in product creation  development and enhancement have always been and continue to be an important factor in our long term success 
investments in this area enable us to serve the factory automation market with increasingly sophisticated sensors and manufacturing control products 
as a result of the lowering of our reliance on outside contractors by approximately  a reduction of personnel costs of approximately  and lower material costs of approximately  we were able to reduce our research and development expenditures by from to as a result of the cost reduction measures introduced in  and a lowering of our reliance on outside contractors  we were able to reduce our research and development expenditures by from to in  and  we introduced a number of new products and product enhancements 
consistent with our dedication to the development of new products  we anticipate that the level of research and development expenses will remain constant in to date  all product development costs have been expensed as incurred 
income taxes as a result of the losses sustained in  we recorded an income tax benefit of of the loss for the year 
our effective income tax rate was in and we expect that our effective tax rate provision for will be reasonably consistent with see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources during  cash flows from operating activities amounted to million 
these cash flows were provided by depreciation and amortization  intangible impairment charges and increased accrued expenses  and were used to offset increased inventories  receivable from our parent and inventories  to purchase fixed assets and to reduce our capital lease obligation 
working capital amounted to million at december   a increase from million at december  our bank line of credit of million was renewed in and extended to june  we have an option to convert up to million of the credit line into a five year term note 
secured by qualified receivables  fixed assets and inventories  borrowings under this credit line bear interest at the bank s prime rate 
at december   none of the line of credit had been utilized 
in anticipation of new product introductions  our inventory increased to million  causing a corresponding increase in accounts payable 
the payment of the  commission lawsuit settlement was made in the first quarter of this resulted an increase in accrued expenses in we made certain capital expenditures during  primarily for production  quality assurance  research and development equipment  information systems and software 
consistent with our historical operations and our current plans for growth  we plan to make additional capital expenditures during  primarily for production  quality assurance and research and development equipment 
while we had no formal commitments at december   it is anticipated that capital expenditures in will be in excess of million  predicated on our profitability and cash resources 
we believe that cash flow from operations and available bank borrowings will be sufficient to meet anticipated working capital requirements through at least while we continue to evaluate financing alternatives from time to time  we have no current plans to raise additional outside capital 
at december   future minimum payments under our leases were as follows 
payments due by period less than one year years years more than years operating lease obligations capital lease obligations relationship with parent intercompany transactions between us and our parent company include charges to our parent for management services provided by us  dividend payments to our parent  if any  and other cash transfers 
our parent files a consolidated tax return including our accounts 
our tax provision or benefit is calculated on a stand alone basis  but includes our intercompany tax sharing arrangement 
factors that may affect future results because of the variety of factors and uncertainties affecting our operating results  past financial performance and historical trends may not be a reliable indicator of future performance 
these factors  as well as other factors affecting our operating performance  may result in significant volatility in our common stock price 
among the factors which could affect our future business  financial condition or operating results are the following our operating results may fluctuate we have experienced fluctuations in annual and quarterly operating results and anticipate that these fluctuations will continue  which may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 
these fluctuations are caused by a number of factors described below and elsewhere in this section  including the level and timing of customer orders  fluctuations in demand for complementary third party products with which our products are sold  changes in the mix of our products sold  timing of operating expenditures  timing of new product introductions  fluctuations in prices charged by our suppliers  seasonality of sales within our core markets  volatility in supply and demand affecting industrial control products generally  such as increases in the supply of competitive products and declines in selling prices  and economic conditions in the us and abroad 
our sales are dependent on independent distributors 
a majority of our sales are through third party distributors  system integrators and original equipment manufacturers 
these resellers are not required to offer our products exclusively 
we cannot assure that a reseller will continue to offer our products 
in addition many of our resellers are privately owned firms which may not be well capitalized  as was demonstrated by the failure of two of our distributors during if our ability to sell products through these third parties is impaired  our results of operations would likely suffer 
the industrial manufacturing equipment industry  and the markets of customers that use our products  are highly cyclical 
our continued success depends in large part on the vibrancy of various industries that use our products 
we operate in a cyclical industry that has been subject to significant economic downturns often in connection with  or in anticipation of  declines in general economic conditions 
these types of downturns have occurred numerous times in the past  most recently in during such downturns  we experience reduced product demand  erosion of average selling prices and gross margins 
our business could be harmed in the future by additional cyclical downturns in the industrial manufacturing equipment industry or by slower growth by any of the markets served by our customers products 
the markets in which we participate are intensely competitive 
our core markets are intensely competitive 
many competitors have substantially greater name recognition and technical  marketing  distribution and financial resources than we have  and we may not be able to compete successfully with them in the future 
competitive pressures could also reduce market acceptance of our products and result in price reductions  decreases in revenues and increases in expenses 
competition in our core markets is based primarily on performance  quality  price and availability 
if we do not compete successfully on these and other factors  our business  financial condition and operating results would be harmed 
average sales prices of our products generally decline over time 
average sales prices in the industrial manufacturing equipment market tend to decline over time as a result of competition  technological advances  manufacturing efficiencies and other factors 
declines in average sales prices for our products  if not offset by reductions in the cost of producing those products or by sales of new products with higher gross margins  would decrease our gross margins  could cause a negative adjustment to the value of our inventories and could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
we do not have long term contracts with our customers 
our customers generally purchase our products on a purchase order basis and do not have long term contracts with us 
as a result  we cannot be certain that our customers will continue to order products from us at the same or higher levels as in the past 
the loss of one or more significant customers  or a decline in overall orders from our customers  would harm our business and operating results 
in addition  the lack of long term sales contracts and significant order backlog makes it difficult for us to forecast future sales with certainty or to accurately forecast component and product requirements 
these factors expose us to a number of risks if we overestimate our requirements we may be obligated to purchase more components or third party products than are required  if we underestimate our requirements  our suppliers may have an inadequate product or product component inventory  which could interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and revenues  we may also experience shortages of product components from time to time  which also could delay the manufacturing of our products  and over or under production can lead to higher expenses  lower than anticipated revenues  and reduced margins 
we may be unable to increase our international sales 
we are attempting to develop  integrate and expand our international distribution networks in an effort to increase international sales of our products 
we may not be successful in developing or expanding our international distribution network or in marketing and selling products in foreign markets 
if the revenues generated by our international sales are not adequate to recover the expense of establishing  expanding  and maintaining an international distribution network  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
if international sales become a more significant component of net sales  our business would be more vulnerable to risks inherent in doing business internationally  including difficulties in managing foreign resellers  longer payment cycles and problems in collecting accounts receivable  the effects of seasonal customer demand  changes in regulatory requirements  difficulties in meeting the requirements of different international product regulations  risks relating to intellectual property rights  increased expenses due to efforts to localize our product offerings  export restrictions  tariffs and other trade barriers  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  and potentially adverse tax consequences and political instability 
the existence or occurrence of any one of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we depend upon suppliers and outsourced manufacturers  several of which are located outside of the us disruption of our access to these supplies and services  or problems with the quality of supplies or services  could prevent us from filling customer orders and harm our business 
the principal components of our products are purchased from outside vendors 
we generally buy components under purchase orders  do not have long term agreements with our suppliers  and we generally do not maintain large inventories of components 
any termination of  or significant disruption of  our relationships with the suppliers of our product components may prevent us from filling customer orders in a timely manner which could result in customer dissatisfaction and lost sales 
for some of our products  including private label products  we rely on third party manufacturers for subassembly of products and for final assembly  quality assurance  and testing of some of our products 
these outsourcing arrangements and any future outsourcing arrangements involve numerous risks  including reduced control over product quality  delivery schedules  manufacturing yields  and costs 
for certain products that we private label  we are dependent on third party suppliers 
we rely on third party suppliers for several finished products that we sell under the sti brand name 
if we do not manage the relationship with the supplier properly or if the supplier stops providing us with these products  we may not be able to find replacement products in a timely manner or at all 
this may prevent us from fulfilling customer orders and have an adverse impact on our financial results 
our business could suffer if we do not respond to technological change and new product development demands of our customers the market for our products is characterized by changing technology  evolving industry standards  changes in customer needs and new product introductions 
our future success will depend on our ability to respond to emerging industry standards  enhance current products  develop new products  and achieve market acceptance of those products  all on a timely and cost effective basis 
the introduction of new products also requires that we manage the transition from older products in order to minimize disruption of customer orders  avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer demands 
product errors or defects could result in product recalls and claims against us 
we manufacture machine safety and automation sensing products  many of which are used in manufacturing  construction and other industrial environments 
errors or defects in our products could contribute to injuries  and could subject us to product liability claims 
any such claims would divert management s attention from our core business  would be expensive to defend  and could result in sizeable damage awards against us 
our existing product liability insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect us from any liabilities we might incur  and we may not be able to maintain this insurance or do so at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms 
any product liability claim brought against us  with or without merit  could also increase our product liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing any coverage in the future 
if a product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or is in excess of our insurance coverage  our business would suffer 
in addition  such claims may require us to recall some of our products  which could result in significant costs to us 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates would have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
while substantially all of our sales are denominated in us dollars  we purchase material for resale denominated in british pounds and euros  and  in the future  we may transact business in other foreign currencies 
increases in value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies have the effect of increasing the prices of our products in foreign markets and  as a result  could harm sales of our products in those markets 
conversely  declines in value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies  as we have recently experienced  has the effect of increasing our operating expenses by increasing the cost of materials we purchase for resale in british pounds and euros 
as a result  future volatility in currency exchange rates would have an adverse effect on our operating results 
an adverse evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting could damage public perception of our financial statements and cause our stock price to decline 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of section  beginning with our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ending december   we will be required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting 
the report must contain a statement as to whether or not our internal controls over financial reporting are effective 
in addition  our independent auditors must attest to and report on management s assessment of such internal controls 
we have begun to expend significant resources to perform the system and process documentation and evaluation needed to comply with section however  if we and our auditors are unable to adequately test our internal controls  or if during this process we identify one or more significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting which we are unable to remedy prior to december   we may be unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective or our auditors may be unable to attest that our management s report is fairly stated 
in such case  we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 
our business could suffer if we are unable to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patent  trademark  trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary rights in our products and services 
there can be no assurance that our patents  trademarks  or contractual arrangements or other steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property will prove sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technology or defer independent third party development of similar technologies 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the technology licenses granted to us from our parent company will continue to be available 
the loss of any of our proprietary technology could require us to obtain technology of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost  which could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
also  competitors may develop their own intellectual property or technologies  obtain their own patents  or challenge the validity of  or be able to design around  our patents 
the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products  services or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
we may initiate claims or litigation against other third parties for infringement of proprietary rights or to establish the validity of proprietary rights 
similarly  our competitors may initiate claims or litigation against us alleging infringement of their proprietary rights or improper use of their intellectual property 
litigation relating to intellectual property to which we may become a party is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including the risk of counterclaims or other litigation against us  and we may not be successful in any such litigation 
our ability to develop and market our products is dependent upon our retention of certain executive officers and other key personnel 
we are greatly dependent on the ability to retain key management and technical personnel  and our future success is highly dependent upon the personal efforts of our management and technical personnel 
the loss of services of any one of them could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our success will also be dependent in part upon our ability to attract  retain  and motivate highly skilled employees 
we may need to offer additional compensation or incentives to attract and retain these and other employees 
we may need to raise additional capital it is possible we may need to raise additional funds in the future  and this additional financing may not be available to us in favorable terms  if at all 
we may also require additional capital to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
if we issue additional equity securities to raise funds  the ownership percentage of our existing stockholders would be reduced 
new investors may demand rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock 
if we issue debt securities to raise funds  we may incur significant interest expense  which would harm our profitability 
the issuance of debt securities may also require us to agree to various restrictions typical of debt securities  including limitations on further borrowing and our right to pay dividends our operations have been and may continue to be negatively impacted by uncertain global economic and political conditions our business may suffer as a result of general economic and political conditions in the us and abroad 
in and  there was a rapid and severe downturn in the us market and global economy 
this downturn has been compounded by recent terrorist activity  such as the attacks in the us on september   and the recent military activity in afghanistan  iraq and the middle east 
additional terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage or disruption to us or to our suppliers and our customers 
fears of global recession  war  and terrorism may continue to have seriously detrimental effects on the us and global economies 
such conditions could further dampen consumer confidence and cause our customers to slow or cease spending on our products 
if these events continue  our operations may be negatively impacted 
the seasonality inherent in our business could cause our operating results to fluctuate 
the industrial manufacturing equipment industry in which we compete has historically been subject to seasonality 
this is also true with respect to european markets in which we compete where business activity declines due to vacations taken in the summer months 
this seasonality  combined with other factors such as the variability in our operating results described above  renders quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations unreliable as indicia of our overall performance 
our parent company has voting control over us 
approximately eighty six percent of our capital stock is currently held by our parent corporation  scientific technology incorporated  a california corporation 
as a result  our parent has control over matters requiring approval by our shareholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or similar transactions  even if other shareholders disagree 
this control  along with provisions of oregon law affecting acquisitions and business combinations  may delay  deter or prevent a third party from acquiring or merging with us and prevent shareholders from realizing a premium price for their shares associated with an acquisition 
this voting control and provisions of oregon law may also have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in our investments represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the area of interest rate changes impacting the fair value of our investment securities 
our policy is to invest primarily in money market accounts and short term investments held at financial institutions 
we do not have any derivative instruments in our investment portfolio 
due to their highly liquid nature  our investments are subject to minimal credit and market risk 
while the majority of our sales are in us dollars  there are some sales in foreign currency 
there is minimal foreign currency exchange risk
