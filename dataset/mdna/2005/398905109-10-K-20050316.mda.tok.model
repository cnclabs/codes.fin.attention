item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with part i  including the matters set forth in the risk factors section of this form k  and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
overview during  as throughout our seven year history  we grew our business primarily through acquisitions 
we typically seek to acquire large  profitable  well established and well managed dealers that are leaders in their respective market areas 
over the past five years  we have acquired dealership franchises with annual revenues of approximately billion  disposed of dealership franchises with annual revenues of approximately million  and been granted nine new dealership franchises by the manufacturers 
each acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and is included in our financial statements from the date of acquisition 
in the following discussion and analysis  we report certain performance measures of our newly acquired dealerships separately from those of our existing dealerships 
our operating results reflect the combined performance of each of our inter related business activities  which include the sale of new vehicles  used vehicles  finance and insurance products  and parts  service and collision repair services 
each of these activities has historically been directly or indirectly impacted by a variety of supply demand factors  including vehicle inventories  consumer confidence  discretionary spending  availability and affordability of consumer credit  manufacturer incentives  weather patterns  and interest rates 
for example  during periods of sustained economic downturn or significant supply demand imbalances  certain of these factors may negatively impact new vehicle sales  as consumers tend to shift their purchases to used vehicles or less expensive new vehicles 
some consumers may even delay their purchasing decisions altogether  electing instead to repair their existing vehicles 
in such cases  however  we believe the impact on our overall business is mitigated due to our ability to offer other products and services  such as used vehicles and parts  service and collision repair services 
for the years ended december   and  we realized net income of million  million and million  respectively  and diluted earnings per share of  and  respectively 
the following factors impacted our financial condition and results of operations in  and  and may cause our reported financial data not to be indicative of our future financial condition and operating results 
year ended december  impairment of goodwill and long lived assets as a result of the further deterioration of our atlanta platform s financial results  we concluded that the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value as of september  accordingly  in the third quarter  we recorded a total pretax charge of million  or million on an after tax basis or per diluted share  related to the impairment of the carrying value of its goodwill and certain long lived assets 
loss on redemption of senior subordinated notes in march  we completed the redemption of all of our outstanding senior subordinated notes and incurred a million pretax charge  or million on an after tax basis or per diluted share 
impairment of indefinite lived intangible asset during our annual assessment of the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in connection with our year end financial statement preparation process  we determined that the carrying value of one of our dealership s intangible franchise rights was in excess of its fair market value 
accordingly  we recorded a pretax charge of million  or million on an after tax basis or per diluted share 
year ended december  resolution of tax contingencies during  we recognized a million reduction  or per diluted share  in our estimated tax liabilities as a result of the favorable resolution of tax contingencies at the conclusion of various state and federal tax audits 
year ended december  loss on redemption of senior subordinated notes during  we repurchased million of our senior subordinated notes and incurred a million pretax charge  or million on an after tax basis or per diluted share 
these items  and other variances between the periods presented  are covered in the following discussion 
key performance indicators the following table highlights certain of the key performance indicators we use to manage our business consolidated statistical data for the year ended unit sales retail sales new vehicle    used vehicle    total retail sales    wholesale sales    total vehicle sales    gross margin new vehicle retail sales used vehicle total adjusted retail sales parts and service sales total gross margin sg a as a of gross profit operating margin operating margin excluding impairment pretax margin pretax margin excluding impairment finance and insurance revenues per retail unit sold  we monitor a statistic we call used vehicle total adjusted retail sales gross margin which equals total used vehicle gross profit  which includes the total net loss from the wholesale sale of used vehicles  divided by retail used vehicle sales revenues 
the profit or loss on wholesale used vehicle sales are included in this number  as these transactions facilitate retail used vehicle sales and management of inventory levels 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our retail unit sales increased  as compared to  as a result of acquisitions  as same store new vehicle unit sales were relatively flat and same store retail unit sales of used vehicles decreased 
over the past three years  our new vehicle gross margin has declined from for the twelve months ended december   to for and for at the same time  however  our consolidated gross profit per retail unit sold has risen slightly from  per unit in  to  per unit in and  per unit in during  decreases in gross profit per retail unit sold in our same store results were offset by increases attributable to the impact of acquired luxury franchises 
we believe our same store results were negatively impacted by rising retail prices  without a corresponding increase in gross profit  as a result of increased competition placing pressure on realized margins 
we expect margin pressures to continue in our used vehicle results are directly affected by the level of manufacturer incentives on new vehicles  the number and quality of trade ins and lease turn ins and the availability of consumer credit 
over the last three years  we have seen a decline in same store retail sales of used vehicle units  partially offset by the benefit received from acquisitions 
during this same time period  however  we have seen pricing begin to stabilize and our adjusted retail sales margin has increased from in to in and our consolidated parts and service gross margin decreased to in  from in  as a result of an increase in contribution from our parts business in relation to our service business 
since our parts business has lower gross margins than our service business  this change in mix has caused our overall parts and service gross margin to decline 
our finance and insurance revenues decreased from  per retail unit sold in to in  reflecting a decline in penetration rates of finance and insurance products for new and used vehicle sales and the dilutive effect of acquisitions  as their finance and insurance revenues per retail unit sold were significantly below our average 
our selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased as a percentage of gross profit from during  to in this increase resulted primarily from increases in same store  non variable costs 
our same store variable costs  namely personnel related items and advertising  decreased in approximately the same percentages as our gross profit 
acquisitions also had a negative effect on our overall average  as their sg a levels were higher than our same store average 
the combination of the above factors  together with the impairment charges recorded in and an increase in our floorplan and other net interest expense  caused a decline in our operating margin to  from in  and in our pretax margin to  from in our floorplan and other net interest expense increased primarily as a result of higher average borrowings due to acquisition activity and rising interest rates 
while we believe that the new vehicle market will remain extremely competitive in  we expect some improvement in the current oversupply of new vehicles and also believe that manufacturers will continue providing low interest financing and other incentives in order to stimulate demand 
these incentives will also likely continue to negatively impact the used vehicle market  as they serve to make new vehicles more affordable and  therefore  more desirable than used vehicles 
tightened credit standards by lenders serving the lower tier and sub prime markets may also continue to negatively affect the used vehicle market 
a factor that will impact our financial performance in is the adoption of a new accounting standard 
specifically  in accordance with sfas r  share based payment  which was issued by the financial accounting standards board in december  we will begin recognizing compensation expense related to stock option and employee stock purchase plan grants in our statement of operations during the third quarter of we believe that our future success depends  among other things  on our ability to successfully acquire and integrate new dealerships  while at the same time achieving optimum performance from our diverse franchise mix  attracting and retaining high caliber employees  and reinvesting as needed to maintain top quality facilities 
during  we expect to spend approximately million to construct new facilities and upgrade or expand existing facilities  although we expect to sell and lease back facilities accounting for approximately million of these expenditures  resulting in net expenditures of million 
in addition  we expect to complete acquisitions of dealerships with approximately million in expected aggregate annual revenues 
critical accounting policies and accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies we use and the estimates and assumptions we make during their preparation 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and critical accounting estimates 
critical accounting policies we have identified below what we believe to be the most pervasive accounting policies that are of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of all our significant accounting policies 
inventories 
we carry our new  used and demonstrator vehicle inventories  as well as our parts and accessories inventories  at the lower of cost or market in our consolidated balance sheets 
vehicle inventory cost consists of the amount paid to acquire the inventory  plus reconditioning cost  cost of equipment added and transportation 
additionally  we receive interest assistance from some of our manufacturers 
this assistance is accounted for as a vehicle purchase price discount and is reflected as a reduction to the inventory cost on our balance sheets and as a reduction to cost of sales in our statements of operation as the vehicles are sold 
as the market value of our inventory typically declines over time  we establish reserves based on our historical loss experience and market trends 
these reserves are charged to cost of sales and reduce the carrying value of our inventory on hand 
used vehicles are complex to value as there is no standardized source for determining exact values and each vehicle and each market in which we operate is unique 
as a result  the value of each used vehicle taken at trade in  or purchased at auction  is subjectively determined based on the industry expertise of the responsible used vehicle manager 
our valuation risk is mitigated  somewhat  by how quickly we turn this inventory 
at december   our used vehicle days supply was days 
retail finance  insurance and vehicle service contract revenues recognition 
we arrange financing for customers through various institutions and receive financing fees based on the difference between the loan rates charged to customers and predetermined financing rates set by the financing institution 
in addition  we receive fees from the sale of insurance and vehicle service contracts to customers 
we may be charged back for unearned financing  insurance contract or vehicle service contract fees in the event of early termination of the contracts by customers 
revenues from these fees are recorded at the time of the sale of the vehicles and a reserve for future amounts which might be charged back is established based on our historical charge back results and the termination provisions of the applicable contracts 
while our charge back results vary depending on the type of contract sold  a change in the historical charge back results used in determining our estimates of future amounts which might be charged back would have changed our reserve at december   by approximately million 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principals requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period 
we analyze our estimates based on our historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results could differ from such estimates 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of businesses acquired over the fair value  at the date of acquisition  of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 business combinations 
prior to our adoption of sfas no 
on january   we recorded purchase prices in excess of the net tangible assets acquired as goodwill and did not separately record any intangible assets apart from goodwill as all were amortized over similar lives 
during  the fasb also issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which changed the treatment of goodwill to no longer permit the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  require goodwill and intangible assets  of which franchise rights is our most significant  to be recorded separately  and require  at least annually  an assessment for impairment of goodwill by reporting unit  which we currently define as each of our platforms  using a fair value based  two step test 
we perform the annual impairment assessment at the end of each calendar year  or more frequently if events or circumstances at a reporting unit occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
to determine the fair value of our reporting units  we use a discounted cash flow approach 
included in this analysis are assumptions regarding revenue growth rates  future gross margin estimates  future selling  general and administrative expense rates and our weighted average cost of capital 
we also must estimate residual values at the end of the forecast period and future capital expenditure requirements 
each of these assumptions requires us to use our knowledge of our industry  our recent transactions  and reasonable performance expectations for our operations 
if any one of the above assumptions changes  in some cases insignificantly  or fails to materialize  the resulting decline in our estimated fair value could result in a material impairment charge to the goodwill associated with the applicable platform s  especially with respect to those platforms acquired prior to july  intangible franchise rights 
our only significant identified intangible assets are rights under our franchise agreements with manufacturers 
we expect these franchise agreements to continue for an indefinite period but  when these agreements do not have indefinite terms  we believe that renewal of these agreements can be obtained without substantial cost 
as such  we believe that our franchise agreements will contribute to cash flows for an indefinite period 
therefore  we do not amortize the carrying amount of our franchise rights 
franchise rights acquired in acquisitions prior to july   were not separately recorded  but were recorded and amortized as part of goodwill and remain a part of goodwill at december  and in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
like goodwill  and in accordance with sfas no 
 we test our franchise rights for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate possible impairment  using a fair value method 
to test the carrying value of each individual franchise right for impairment  we use a discounted cash flow based approach 
included in this analysis are assumptions  at a dealership level  regarding revenue growth rates  future gross margin estimates and future selling  general and administrative expense rates 
using our weighted average cost of capital  estimated residual values at the end of the forecast period and future capital expenditure requirements  we calculate the fair value of each dealership s franchise rights after considering estimated values for tangible assets  working capital and workforce 
if any one of the above assumptions changes  in some cases insignificantly  or fails to materialize  the resulting decline in our estimated fair value could result in a material impairment charge to the intangible franchise right associated with the applicable dealership 
self insurance property and casualty insurance reserves 
we are self insured for a portion of the claims related to our property and casualty insurance programs  requiring us to make estimates regarding expected claims to be incurred 
these estimates  for the portion of claims not covered by insurance  are based primarily on our historical claims experience and projected inflation in claims costs in future periods 
changes in the frequency or severity of claims from historical levels could impact our reserve for claims and our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
a change in the historical loss history used in determining our estimate of future losses would have changed our reserve at december   by million 
our current total exposure under our self insured property and casualty plans totals approximately million  before consideration of accruals we have recorded related to our loss projections 
after consideration of these accruals  our remaining potential loss exposure under these plans totals approximately million at december  fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we estimate the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations  which involves the use of various assumptions 
the most significant assumptions  and those requiring the most judgment  involve the estimated fair values of property and equipment and intangible franchise rights  with the remaining attributable to goodwill  if any 
results of operations the following tables present comparative financial and non financial data of our same store locations  those locations acquired or disposed of transactions during the periods and the consolidated company for the twelve months ended december   and same store amounts include the results of dealerships for the identical months in each period presented in the comparison  commencing with the first month in which the dealership was owned by us and  in the case of dispositions  ending with the last month it was owned by us 
same store results also include the activities of the corporate office 
this presentation differs from prior years  in which same store amounts would have included only those dealerships owned during all of the months of both periods in the comparison  as well as the activities of the corporate office 
for example  using our prior methodology  a dealership acquired in june would not show up in our full year same store results until when comparing to this would be the earliest it would be owned by us for all of the months of both periods in the annual comparison 
however  under our current methodology  the results from this dealership will now appear in our same store comparison beginning in  for the period july through december  when comparing to july through december results 
we believe our current methodology will enable readers of our financial statements to assess the results of acquired operations on a more timely basis 
new vehicle retail data dollars in thousands  except per unit amounts for the year ended for the year ended change change retail unit sales same stores     transactions    total     retail sales revenues same stores     transactions     total     gross profit same stores     transactions     total     average gross profit per retail unit sold same stores     transactions     total     gross margin same stores transactions total inventory days supply same stores transactions total inventory days supply equals units in inventory at the end of the period  divided by units sales for the month then ended  multiplied by days 
during  as compared to  our same store unit sales increased slightly as significant declines in sales of ford and mitsubishi units were offset by increases in sales of toyota scion and nissan models  in addition to slight variances between other brands 
we believe these changes are consistent with industry trends for our brands and markets 
although same store unit sales increased in from  our same store average gross profit per retail unit sold decreased  resulting in lower gross profit 
we believe this decrease was largely due to high industrywide inventory levels and intense competition 
our total average gross profit per retail unit sold did benefit from the impact of luxury franchises acquired this year  which generally yield higher gross profit than domestic or import non luxury franchises 
during  as compared to  we experienced significant declines in same store sales of ford  mitsubishi and toyota without any notable offsetting increases from other brands 
these decreases  which we also believe to be consistent with industry trends for our brands and markets  were partially offset by an increase in our same store average gross profit per retail unit sold 
most manufacturers offer interest assistance to offset floorplan interest charges incurred in connection with inventory purchases 
for us  this assistance has ranged from approximately to of our total floorplan interest expense over the past three years 
we record these incentives as a reduction of new vehicle cost of sales as the vehicles are sold  which therefore impact the gross profit and gross margin detailed above 
the total assistance recognized in cost of goods sold during the years ended december   and  was million  million and million  respectively 
finally  our days supply of new vehicle inventory continues to decrease  from days supply at december   to days supply at december   and days supply at december   as we work towards our target level of days supply 
our days supply at december   was heavily weighted toward our domestic inventory  which stood at days supply  versus our import brands in which we had a days supply 
used vehicle retail data dollars in thousands  except per unit amounts for the year ended for the year ended change change retail unit sales same stores     transactions   total     retail sales revenues same stores     transactions     total     gross profit same stores     transactions    total     average gross profit per retail unit sold same stores     transactions     total     gross margin same stores transactions total used vehicle wholesale data dollars in thousands  except per unit amounts for the year ended for the year ended change change wholesale unit sales same stores     transactions   total     wholesale sales revenues same stores     transactions     total     net loss same stores     transactions total     average wholesale loss per wholesale unit sold same stores transactions total gross margin same stores transactions total total used vehicle data dollars in thousands  except per unit amounts for the year ended for the year ended change change used vehicle unit sales same stores     transactions    total     sales revenues same stores     transactions     total     gross profit same stores     transactions    total     gross margin same stores transactions total average gross profit per used vehicle unit sold same stores transactions  total inventory days supply same stores transactions total adjusted retail gross margin same stores transactions total average adjusted gross profit per retail unit sold same stores     transactions     total     inventory days supply equals units in inventory at the end of the period  divided by units sales for the month then ended  multiplied by days 
adjusted retail gross margin equals total gross profit  which includes net wholesale loss  divided by retail sales revenues 
the profit or loss on wholesale sales are included in this number  as these transactions facilitate retail vehicle sales and management of inventory levels 
average adjusted gross profit per retail unit sold equals total used vehicle gross profit  which includes net wholesale loss  divided by retail unit sales 
the profit or loss on wholesale sales are included in this number  as these transactions facilitate retail vehicle sales and management of inventory levels 
at times  including during and  manufacturer incentives such as significant rebates and below market retail financing rates on new vehicles  have resulted in a reduction of the price difference to the customer between a late model used vehicle and a new vehicle  thus driving more customers to new vehicles 
over the last three years  we have experienced declines in our same store used vehicle sales volume 
the impact of these declines in volume was partially offset by increases in both the average gross profit from retail sales of used vehicles as well as overall increases in total gross profit per retail unit sold including the impact on total used vehicle gross profit from the losses incurred on wholesale vehicle transactions 
for the twelve months ended december   compared to  our same store locations sold fewer retail used vehicles  but realized higher average gross profit per retail unit sold 
we believe that our decline in retail unit sales volume is consistent with overall results for used vehicles in the markets we operate 
the increase in our average gross profit per retail unit sold was the result of an increase in our gross profit from both the sale of used cars and trucks and an increase in the number of used trucks sold in proportion to used cars 
our average gross profit from the sale of used trucks is generally higher than our average gross profit from the sale of used cars 
although we had a increase in our same store average gross profit per retail unit sold  we also had an increase of in average wholesale loss per wholesale unit sold  which when taken together resulted in a slight increase of in our same store average gross profit per used vehicle sold 
the dealerships we acquired during  although yielding a lower used vehicle retail gross margin than our same stores  realized a higher average gross profit per retail vehicle sold than our same stores 
we believe both of these factors result from the impact of luxury dealerships acquired  whose used vehicle businesses typically have higher retail sales prices and higher gross profit per unit 
these dealerships also realized a lower average loss per vehicle sold in the wholesale market bringing our total gross margin from acquired dealerships to a point comparable to our existing stores 
for the twelve months ended december   compared to  our same store locations sold fewer retail used vehicles  but realized an higher average gross profit per retail unit sold 
we believe our decline in used vehicle unit sales between and was also consistent with the overall results for used vehicles in the markets we operated during that time period 
the increase in our average gross profit between these periods was also the result of an increase in our gross profit from the sale of used cars and trucks and an increase in the number of used trucks sold in proportion to used cars 
in addition to the increase in our same store average gross profit per retail unit sold  we also saw a decrease of in average wholesale loss per wholesale unit sold  which when taken together resulted in an increase of in our same store average gross profit per used vehicle sold 
in addition  as a result of continued weakness in the used vehicle market at december   we had reserved approximately million for estimated used vehicle losses to be incurred during this reserve was applied against losses incurred retailing and wholesaling used vehicles during based on a detailed review of our used vehicle inventory at december   subsequent sales of this inventory and economic trends indicating an improved used vehicle market  we determined that a million reserve at december   was the appropriate used vehicle reserve and it was not necessary to charge used vehicle cost of sales to establish the used vehicle reserve at the same level as at december  finally  our days supply of used vehicle inventory has continued to decrease  from days supply at december   to days supply at december   and days supply at december   as we target days supply 
parts and service data dollars in thousands for the year ended for the year ended change change parts and service revenues same stores     transactions     total     parts and service gross profit same stores     transactions     total     gross margin same stores transactions total our consolidated parts and service gross margin decreased to in  from in and in  as a result of an increase in contribution from the lower margin parts and collision service businesses in relation to our higher margin customer pay and warranty service business  as well as a slight decline attributable to the impact from acquisitions and recently opened operations 
our same store parts and service revenues have increased  primarily  as a result of our expanding wholesale parts business 
this business has increased from of our same store parts and service sales in  to of our sales in and in although this business has contributed to a large part of our overall parts and service revenue growth  our margins in this line of business are significantly lower than those in our retail parts and service operations 
finance and insurance data dollars in thousands  except per unit amounts for the year ended for the year ended change change retail new and used unit sales same stores     transactions     total     retail finance fees same stores     transactions   total     vehicle service contract fees same stores     transactions   total     insurance and other same stores     transactions   total     total same stores     transactions    total     finance and insurance revenues per unit sold same stores  transactions  total   our finance and insurance revenues per retail unit sold decreased in  as compared to  as a result of lower same store penetration of products on both new and used vehicles and the impact from current year acquisitions  which generally had lower penetration of finance and insurance products on sales of new and used vehicles than our existing stores 
our finance and insurance revenues per retail unit increased in  as compared to  as a result of increases in vehicle service contracts and other finance and insurance revenues  discussed in more detail below 
our same store retail finance fees decreased  as compared to  due to a decrease in unit sales and a decline in penetration on total unit sales 
this decline in penetration was primarily attributable to a decrease in penetration on unit sales of used vehicles as a result of an overall challenging credit market for these vehicles 
our same store retail finance fees decreased  when compared to  primarily due to our decrease in unit sales 
our same store vehicle service contract fees decreased  as compared to  primarily as a result of the decrease in used vehicles sold  as well as a decline in the amount of previously deferred revenue recognized on contracts sold in prior years 
the increase in same store vehicle service contract fees during  as compared to  was primarily a result of the increase in deferred revenue recognized on contracts sold in prior years partially offset by a decrease in same store insurance revenues attributable to the decline in retail unit sales 
this increase was partially offset by the impact of the decline in retail unit sales 
the decline in our same store other finance and insurance revenues from million in  to million in  was primarily the result of higher chargebacks and a reduction of revenue from ancillary service products 
the increase in our same store other finance and insurance revenues from million in  to million in  was primarily attributable to certain products sold in two of our platforms in prior years  partially offset by a decrease in same store insurance revenues attributable to the decline in retail unit sales 
in december  we increased our revenue and cost deferrals related to these products to properly reflect our future obligations not previously accounted for  thereby reducing our net revenues for the period by million 
we have not sold a significant number of contracts requiring revenue and cost deferral since  thus  we expect the majority of the remaining deferred revenues  and associated deferred costs  to be recognized over the next three years 
selling  general and administrative data dollars in thousands for the year ended for the year ended change change personnel same stores     transactions     total     advertising same stores     transactions    total     rent and facility costs same stores     transactions    total     other sg a same stores     transactions    total     total sg a same stores     transactions     total     total gross profit same stores     transactions     total     sg a as of gross profit same stores transactions total our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and incentive based compensation  as well as rent  advertising  insurance  benefits  utilities and other fixed expenses 
we believe that our personnel and advertising expenses are variable and can be adjusted in response to changing business conditions 
in such a case  however  it may take us several months to adjust our cost structure  or we may elect not to fully adjust a variable component  such as advertising expenses 
the decreases in same store personnel related costs from to  and also from to  are consistent with the changes noted in same store gross profit  as our commissioned salespeople and platform management compensation is closely tied to dealership gross profit 
advertising expense is managed locally and will vary period to period based upon current trends  market factors and other circumstances in each individual market 
the increase in same store rent and facility costs when comparing to is primarily due to rent increases associated with new facilities and scheduled rent increases  tied to changes in the consumer price or similar index  on existing facilities 
the increase in same store rent and facility costs when comparing to was primarily due to increased utilities and real estate taxes 
other sg a consists primarily of insurance  freight  supplies  professional fees  loaner car expenses  vehicle delivery expenses  software licenses and other data processing costs  and miscellaneous other operating costs not related to personnel  advertising or facilities 
during  as compared to  our same store items increased million primarily as a result of the following we incurred million of higher losses from our property and casualty retained risk program  primarily from two significant events a hailstorm that damaged or destroyed more than  vehicles  or about of the inventory  at our amarillo  texas  dealerships during the second quarter of  and the damage sustained at our florida dealerships from hurricanes during the third quarter of  we had a million increase in professional fees  primarily related to the assessment and testing of our internal control environment in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act  during  as a result of favorable collection activity on a portfolio of customer loans we guaranteed in prior years  we realized a million benefit related to the reduction of a previously established required guarantee liability 
during  we further reduced this guarantee liability by million  we had a million increase in vehicle delivery expenses  primarily due to higher fuel costs  and we accrued an estimated million for our expected settlement costs based on the progression of settlement discussions in the class action lawsuit regarding vehicle inventory tax charges to which we are a party in texas 
the remainder is attributable to numerous less significant items which in total increased by approximately million on a net basis  or an increase of as compared to same store other sg a for this increase is  on a percentage basis  approximately the same as our other less variable rent and facility costs 
depreciation and amortization data dollars in thousands for the year ended for the year ended change change same stores     transactions  total     our same store depreciation and amortization expense increased between each period presented primarily as a result of a number of facility additions  including service bay expansions  facility upgrades and manufacturer required image renovations 
impairment of assets in accordance with sfas no 
 we assess goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
we also assess  when events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred  the carrying value of our other long lived assets  primarily our property and equipment  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
based on the organization and management of our business  we have determined that each of our platforms currently qualify as reporting units for the purpose of assessing goodwill for impairment 
however  we are required to evaluate the carrying value of our indefinite lived intangible franchise rights at a dealership level 
during october  in connection with the preparation and review of our third quarter interim financial statements  we determined that recent events and circumstances at our atlanta platform  including further deterioration of the platform s financial results and recent changes in platform management  indicated that an impairment of goodwill may have occurred in the three months ended september  as a result  we performed an interim impairment assessment of the atlanta platform s goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
after analyzing the long term potential of the atlanta market and the expected pretax income of its dealership franchises in atlanta  we estimated the fair value of the reporting unit as of september  as a result of the required comparison  we determined that the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value as of september   and recorded a pretax goodwill impairment charge of million 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we review long lived assets for impairment whenever there is evidence that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
as a result of the factors noted above  we evaluated the long lived assets of the dealerships within our atlanta platform for impairment under the provisions of sfas no 
and recorded a pretax impairment charge for certain leasehold improvements of million at september  during our annual assessment of the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as part of our year end financial statement preparation process  we determined that the carrying value of one of our dealership s intangible franchise rights was in excess of its fair market value and recorded a pretax impairment charge of million at december  floorplan interest expense dollars in thousands for the year ended for the year ended change change same stores     transactions   total     our floorplan interest expense fluctuates based on changes in borrowings outstanding and interest rates  which are based on libor or prime in some cases plus a spread 
our same store floorplan interest expense increased during the twelve months ended december   compared to  as a result of an approximate million increase in weighted average borrowings outstanding between the periods and an approximate basis point increase in weighted average interest rates 
the increase in weighted average borrowings was primarily a result of the use of the proceeds from our senior subordinated notes offering in august to temporarily pay down our floorplan notes payable 
these funds were partially redrawn in march to fund the redemption of our senior subordinated notes and in june to fund our acquisition of the peterson automotive group 
our same store floorplan interest expense decreased during the twelve months ended december   compared to  as a result of an approximate basis point decrease in weighted average interest rates  partially offset by the impact of an approximate million increase in weighted average borrowings outstanding between the periods 
the increase in weighted average borrowings between and resulted primarily from an increase in our same store average new vehicle inventory supply to days during from days during also impacting same store floorplan expense between each of the periods were changes attributable to our outstanding interest rate swaps 
during  we had two interest rate swaps outstanding the entire year  each with notional amounts of million and converting day libor to a fixed rate

liquidity and capital resources our liquidity and capital resources are primarily derived from cash on hand  cash from operations  borrowings under our credit facilities  which provide floorplan  working capital and acquisition financing  and proceeds from debt and equity offerings 
while we cannot guarantee it  based on current facts and circumstances  including our recently obtained additional commitments under our revolving credit agreement discussed below  we believe we have adequate cash flow  coupled with available borrowing capacity  to fund our current operations  capital expenditures and acquisition program for if our capital expenditures or acquisition plans for change  we may need to access the private or public capital markets to obtain additional funding

net income  after adding back depreciation  amortization and other non cash charges  is generally a good indicator of our operating cash flow as revenues are converted into cash in a very short time frame  typically less than two weeks  and we have very few deferred expenses

additionally  we spent million repurchasing a portion of our senior subordinated notes and million for repurchases of common stock 
working capital 
at december   we had working capital of million  approximating the amount we believe is necessary to operate our existing business 
changes in our working capital are driven primarily by changes in floorplan notes payable outstanding 
borrowings on our new vehicle floorplan notes payable  subject to agreed upon pay off terms  are equal to of the factory invoice of the vehicles 
borrowings on our used vehicle floorplan notes payable  subject to agreed upon pay off terms  are limited to of the aggregate book value of our used vehicle inventory 
at times  we have made payments on our floorplan notes payable using excess cash flow from operations and the proceeds of debt and equity offerings 
as needed  we reborrow the amounts later  up to the limits on the floorplan notes payable discussed below  for working capital  acquisitions  capital expenditures or general corporate purposes 
credit facilities 
our various credit facilities are used to finance the purchase of inventory  provide acquisition funding and provide working capital for general corporate purposes 
our two facilities currently provide us with a total of billion of borrowing capacity 
revolving credit facility 
this facility matures in june and now provides a total of million of financing  after we exercised our option to expand the facility by million in july we can further expand the facility to its maximum commitment of billion  subject to participating lender approval 
this facility consists of two tranches million for floorplan financing  which we refer to as the floorplan tranche  and million for acquisitions  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes  including the issuance of letters of credit 
we refer to this tranche as the acquisition line 
the acquisition line bears interest at libor plus a margin that ranges from to basis points  depending on our leverage ratio 
the floorplan tranche bears interest at rates equal to libor plus basis points for new vehicle inventory and libor plus basis points for used vehicle inventory 
our revolving credit facility contains various covenants including financial ratios  such as fixed charge coverage and interest coverage  and a minimum net worth requirement  among others  as well as additional maintenance requirements 
our group of lenders is comprised of major financial institutions  including two manufacturer captive finance companies 
as of february   million was available  after deducting million for outstanding letters of credit  to be drawn under the acquisition line  and million was available to be drawn under the floorplan tranche for inventory purchases 
ford motor credit facility 
we have a separate floorplan financing arrangement with ford motor credit company  which we refer to as the fmcc facility  to provide financing for our entire ford  lincoln and mercury new vehicle inventory 
the fmcc facility  which matures on june   provides for up to million of financing for inventory at an interest rate equal to prime plus basis points minus certain incentives 
as of february   million was available for inventory purchases 
we expect the net cost of our borrowings under the fmcc facility  after all incentives  to be slightly higher than the cost of borrowing under the floorplan tranche of our revolving credit facility 
the following table summarizes the current position of our credit facilities as of december  total credit facility commitment outstanding available in thousands floorplan tranche    acquisition line    total revolving credit facility    fmcc facility    total credit facilities    the outstanding balance at december  includes million of letters of credit 
the total commitment reflects the aggregate commitment of million less million of reserves as required by the lenders

senior subordinated notes 
during august  we completed a private offering of million of senior subordinated notes due the net proceeds from the offering of million were used to temporarily pay down borrowings under the floorplan tranche of our revolving credit facility 
during  we reborrowed these amounts to fund acquisitions and to redeem all of our outstanding senior subordinated notes 
the senior subordinated notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by our dealership subsidiaries and contain various provisions that permit us to redeem the notes at our option and a requirement that we repurchase all of the notes upon a change of control 
additionally  the notes contain various financial and other covenants  such as limitations on the incurrence of debt  the payment of dividends  the repurchase of stock  and the disposition of assets  among others 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
for a more detailed discussion of our notes please see note to our consolidated financial statements 
uses of liquidity and capital resources senior subordinated notes redemption 
on march   we completed the redemption of all of our senior subordinated notes 
total cash used in completing the redemption  excluding accrued interest of million  was million 
capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures include expenditures to extend the useful life of current facilities and expenditures to start or expand operations 
historically  our annual capital expenditures  exclusive of new or expanded operations  have approximately equaled our annual depreciation charge 
in general  expenditures relating to the construction or expansion of dealership facilities are driven by new franchises being granted to us by a manufacturer  significant growth in sales at an existing facility  or manufacturer imaging programs 
during  we plan to invest approximately million to expand or relocate existing facilities  prepare six new facilities for operations  perform manufacturer required imaging projects at four locations and purchase equipment for new and expanded facilities 
we have agreed to sell and leaseback four of the projects scheduled for completion during expected total proceeds from the sales of these construction projects is estimated at approximately million  resulting in net capital expenditures for new and expanded operations of million 
upon sale we will begin leasing the facilities from the buyers resulting in an estimated incremental annual rent expense of million per year 
acquisitions 
from january   through december   we completed acquisitions of franchises with expected annual revenues of approximately billion 
these acquisitions included a platform in new jersey with three franchises  a platform in california with nine franchises and one collision center  and a platform in new york with four franchises and one collision center 
the remaining franchises were acquired in tuck in acquisitions that complement existing platform operations in california  massachusetts  and texas 
the aggregate consideration paid in completing these acquisitions was approximately million in cash  net of cash received   shares of common stock and the assumption of million of inventory financing 
our acquisition target for is to complete acquisitions that have approximately million in expected annual revenues 
we expect the cash needed to complete our acquisitions will come from excess working capital  operating cash flows of our dealerships  and borrowings under our credit facility 
depending on the market value of our common stock  we may issue common stock to fund a portion of the purchase price of acquisitions 
we purchase businesses based on expected return on investment 
generally  the purchase price is approximately to of the annual revenue 
thus  our targeted acquisition budget of million is expected to cost us between and million 
since december   we have completed tuck in acquisitions of two franchises  with expected annual revenues of million  in tulsa  oklahoma under our bob howard auto group platform  for approximately million in cash  net of cash received  and the assumption of million of inventory financing 
stock repurchases 
in march  our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million of our stock  subject to management s judgment and the restrictions of our various debt agreements 
during  we repurchased approximately  shares of our common stock for approximately million  a portion of which was purchased under a previous board of directors authorization established in february  with the remainder purchased under the march authorization 
as of december   million remained under the board of directors march authorization 
this amount is less than the amount permitted under the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes  our most restrictive agreement with respect to stock repurchases 
the amount we are able to repurchase under this indenture adjusts based on future net income and issuances of common stock 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of december payments due by period contractual obligations total year years years thereafter in thousands floorplan notes payable   long term debt obligations      operating leases      purchase commitments    total      excludes interest payments includes borrowings on the acquisition line and outstanding letters of credit includes capital expenditures  acquisition commitment and other we lease various real estate  facilities and equipment under long term operating lease agreements 
generally  our real estate and facility leases have year total terms with initial terms of years and three additional five year terms  at our option 
we generally do not have an option to purchase the real estate and facilities at the end of the lease term  but generally have a right of first refusal that gives us the opportunity to purchase the real estate and facilities if the owner reaches an agreement to sell them to a third party 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following information about our market sensitive financial instruments constitutes a forward looking statement 
our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
our policy is to manage interest rate exposure through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
at december   fixed rate debt  primarily consisting of our senior subordinated notes outstanding  totaled million and had a fair value of million 
at december   we had million of variable rate floorplan borrowings and million of variable rate acquisition line borrowings outstanding 
based on these amounts  a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate million change to our interest expense 
our exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to vehicle floorplan borrowings is partially mitigated by manufacturers floorplan assistance  which in some cases is based on variable interest rates 
this assistance  which has ranged from approximately to of our floorplan interest expense over the past three years  totaled million in  million in  and million in we treat this interest assistance as a vehicle purchase price discount  and reflect it as a reduction of new vehicle cost of sales as new vehicles are sold 
a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate million change in floorplan assistance 
interest rate swaps may be used to adjust our exposure to interest rate movements when appropriate based upon market conditions 
these swaps are entered into with financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings  thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss
