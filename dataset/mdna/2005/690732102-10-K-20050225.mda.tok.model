management expects this acquisition to be accretive in critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates it uses to prepare its financial statements 
management s estimates are generally based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are judged to be reasonable in light of the relevant facts and circumstances 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ 
critical accounting policies are defined as those policies that relate to estimates that require a company to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and could have a material impact on the company s results due to changes in the estimate or the use of different estimates that could reasonably have been used 
management believes its critical accounting policies and estimates include its allowances for losses on accounts and notes receivable  inventory valuation  accounting for goodwill  and self insurance liabilities 
allowances for losses on accounts and notes receivable 
the company maintains valuation allowances based upon the expected collectibility of accounts and notes receivable 
the allowances include specific amounts for accounts that are likely to be uncollectible  such as customer bankruptcies and disputed amounts  and general allowances for accounts that may become uncollectible 
these allowances are estimated based on a number of factors  including industry trends  current economic conditions  creditworthiness of customers  age of the receivables and changes in customer payment patterns 
at december   the company had accounts and notes receivable of million  net of allowances of million 
an unexpected bankruptcy or other adverse change in financial condition of a customer could result in increases in these allowances  which could have a material effect on net income 
the company actively manages its accounts receivable to minimize credit risk 
inventory valuation 
in order to state inventories at the lower of lifo cost or market  the company maintains an allowance for obsolete and excess inventory based upon the expectation that some inventory will become obsolete and be sold for less than cost or become unsaleable altogether 
the allowance is estimated based on factors such as age of the inventory and historical trends 
at december   the company had inventory of million  net of an allowance of million 
changes in product specifications  customer product preferences or the loss of a customer could result in unanticipated impairment in net realizable value that 
table of contents may have a material impact on cost of goods sold  gross margin  and net income 
the company actively manages its inventory levels to minimize the risk of loss and has consistently achieved a high level of inventory turnover 
goodwill 
the company performs an impairment test of its goodwill based on its reporting units as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  on an annual basis 
in performing the impairment test  the company determines the fair value of its reporting units using valuation techniques which can include multiples of the units earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  present value of expected cash flows and quoted market prices 
the ebitda multiples are based on an analysis of current market capitalizations and recent acquisition prices of similar companies 
the fair value of each reporting unit is then compared to its carrying value to determine potential impairment 
the company s goodwill totaled million at december  the impairment review required by sfas requires the extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates 
the application of alternative assumptions  such as different discount rates or ebitda multiples  or the testing for impairment at a different level of organization or on a different organization structure  could produce materially different results 
self insurance liabilities 
the company is self insured for most employee healthcare  workers compensation  and automobile liability costs 
the company estimates its liabilities for healthcare costs using current and historical claims data 
liabilities for workers compensation and automobile liability claims are estimated using historical claims data and loss development factors provided by outside actuaries 
if the underlying facts and circumstances of existing claims change or historical trends are not indicative of future trends  then the company may be required to record additional expense or reductions to expense that could be material to the company s financial condition and results of operations 
self insurance liabilities for employee healthcare  workers compensation  and automobile liability costs totaled million at december  recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  inventory costs  which addresses how a business enterprise should account for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage incurred in the production and acquisition of inventory 
the provisions of sfas require that these costs be recognized as current period charges  rather than as inventory cost 
the company will be required to adopt the provisions of this standard beginning on january  management does not expect application of this standard to have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  exchanges of nonmonetary assets  which addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets 
the provisions of sfas require that all exchanges of nonmonetary assets that have commercial substance be recorded at fair value 
the company will be required to adopt the provisions of this standard beginning on january  management does not expect application of this standard to have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  share based payment  a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r also supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas  statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires that all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values  while sfas as originally issued provided the option of recognizing share based payments based on their fair values or based on their intrinsic values with pro forma disclosure of the effect of recognizing the payments based on their fair values 

table of contents the company will be required to adopt the provisions of this standard beginning on july   with earlier adoption encouraged 
sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
as permitted by sfas  the company currently uses the intrinsic value method as defined by apb to account for share based payments 
as a result  the adoption of sfas r is expected to have a material effect on the company s results of operations  although it will not affect the company s overall financial position 
as the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods will depend on the levels of future grants  the effect of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted with certainty 
however  had the company adopted sfas r in prior periods  the effect of adoption would have approximated the effect of using the fair value method  as defined in sfas  to account for share based payment as disclosed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements under the caption stock based compensation 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as financing cash flows  rather than as operating cash flows as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future  as they depend on a number of factors including the timing of employee exercises of stock options and the value of the company s stock at the date of those exercises  the amount of cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions would have been million  million and million in  and had the company adopted sfas r in prior periods 
customer risk the company is subject to risks associated with changes in the healthcare industry  including competition and continued efforts to control costs  which place pressure on operating earnings  changes in the way medical and surgical services are delivered  and changes in manufacturer preferences between the sale of product directly to hospital customers and the use of wholesale distribution 
the loss of one of the company s larger customers could have a significant effect on its business
