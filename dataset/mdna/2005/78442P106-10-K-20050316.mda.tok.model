item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations years ended december  dollars in millions  except per share amounts forward looking and cautionary statements some of the statements contained in this annual report discuss future expectations and business strategies or include other forward looking information 
those statements are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements 
the forward looking information is based on various factors and was derived using numerous assumptions 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements 
overview we are the largest source of funding  delivery and servicing support for education loans in the united states primarily through our participation in the ffelp 
our primary business is to originate  acquire and hold student loans  with the net interest income and gains on the sales of student loans in securitization being the primary source of our earnings 
we also earn fees for pre default and post default receivables management services 
we are now engaged in every phase of the student loan life cycle from originating and servicing student loans to default prevention and ultimately the collection on defaulted student loans 
we also provide a wide range of financial services  processing capabilities and information technology to meet the needs of educational institutions  lenders  students and their families  and guarantee agencies 
slm corporation  more commonly known as sallie mae  is a holding company that operates through a number of subsidiaries and references in this annual report to the company refer to slm corporation and its subsidiaries 
we have used both internal growth and strategic acquisitions to attain our leadership position in the education finance marketplace 
we have the largest sales force in the student loan industry that delivers our product offerings on campuses 
the core of our marketing strategy is to promote our on campus brands  which generate student loan originations through our preferred channel 
loans generated through our preferred channel are more profitable than loans acquired through our forward purchase commitments or the spot market since they are owned earlier in the student loan s life and we generally incur lower costs on such loans 
we have built brand leadership between the sallie mae name  the brands of our subsidiaries and those of our lender partners  such that we capture the volume of three of the top five originators of ffelp loans 
these sales and marketing efforts are supported by the largest and most diversified servicing capabilities in the industry  providing an unmatched array of servicing capability to financial aid offices 
in recent years we have diversified our business through the acquisition of several companies that provide default management and loan collections services  all of which are combined in our debt management operations dmo business segment 
initially these acquisitions concentrated in the student loan industry  but through a acquisition we expanded our capabilities to include a full range of accounts receivable management services to a number of different industries 
the dmo business segment has been expanding rapidly such that revenue grew percent in and we now employ over  people in this segment 
in december  we completed the wind down of the gse and are now a fully privatized company 
we have defeased all remaining gse debt obligations and dissolved the gse s federal charter 
the liquidity provided to the company by the gse has been replaced by non gse financing  including securitizations originated by non gse subsidiaries of slm corporation 
this funding transformation was accomplished by increasing and diversifying our investor base over the last three years 
we now have a number of sources of liquidity including the formation of our first asset backed commercial paper program billion in available borrowings and our unsecured revolving credit facilities  which were increased from billion to billion in see student loan marketing association privatization act completion of the gse wind down for a more detailed discussion of the gse wind down 
on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the new standard will be effective for public entities excluding small business issuers in the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june   irrespective of the entity s fiscal year 
early adoption is permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
sfas no 
r allows for two transition alternatives for public companies a modified prospective transition or b modified retrospective transition 
we are still evaluating both methods  but have tentatively decided to apply the modified retrospective transition alternative for all periods presented and will recognize compensation cost in the amounts previously reported in the pro forma footnote disclosure under the provisions of sfas no 
had we adopted sfas no 
r in  our diluted earnings per share would have been 
lower and the effect going forward should have a similar effect on diluted earnings per share 
business segments we manage our business through two primary business segments the lending business segment and the dmo business segment 
these businesses are considered reportable segments under sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  based on quantitative thresholds applied to the company s financial statements 
in addition  we provide other complementary products and services  including guarantor and student loan servicing through smaller business units that do not meet such thresholds and are aggregated in the corporate and other business segment for financial reporting purposes 
since our business segments operate in distinct business environments  the discussion herein of the results of our operations is primarily presented on a segment basis 
the lending business segment includes all discussion of income and related expenses associated with net interest margin  student loan spread and its components  securitization gains and the ongoing servicing and securitization income  derivative market value gains and losses  and other fees earned on our managed portfolio of student loans 
the dmo business segment reflects the fees earned and expenses incurred to operate our dmo business 
our corporate and other business segment includes our remaining fee businesses and other corporate expenses that do not pertain directly to the primary segments identified above 
sfas no 
requires public companies to report financial and descriptive information about their reportable operating segments 
this is the first year that the company has been required to present segment information in accordance with sfas no 
 and we have included this information for all periods presented in our financial statements as required by sec rules 
the segment information that follows in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a includes certain condensed financial information in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
in accordance with sfas no 
 in note to our consolidated financial statements  segment reporting  we present separate financial information about our operating segments that is used regularly by the chief operating decision makers in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing the operating results of the business 
the financial information included in note reflects certain non gaap performance measures  which we refer to as core cash measures 
these core cash measures are discussed in greater detail below in alternative performance measures 
lending business segment in our lending business segment  we originate and acquire federally guaranteed student loans  which are administered by the us department of education ed  and private education loans  which are not federally guaranteed 
the majority of our private education loans are made in conjunction with a ffelp stafford loan and as a result are marketed through the same marketing channels as ffelp stafford loans 
while ffelp student loans and private education loans have different overall risk profiles due to the federal guarantee of the ffelp student loans  they share many of the same characteristics such as similar repayment terms  the same marketing channel and sales force  and are originated and serviced on the same platform 
finally  where possible  the borrower receives a single bill for both the federally guaranteed and privately underwritten loans 
the earnings growth in our lending business segment is a product of the growth in our managed portfolio of student loans and the earning spread on those loans 
in  the managed portfolio grew by percent to billion at december  as a result of receiving the exceptional performer ep designation from ed  approximately percent of our managed ffelp student loans are percent guaranteed by the federal government and as such represent high quality assets with very little credit risk 
at december   our managed ffelp student loan portfolio was billion or percent of our total managed student loans 
trends in the lending business segment the growth in our lending business segment has been largely driven by the steady growth in the demand for post secondary education in the united states over the last decade 
this growth is evident in the volume of loans we originated or acquired in we acquired or originated billion of student loans in  a percent increase over the billion in of this  we originated billion of student loans through our preferred channel  an increase of percent over the billion of student loans originated through our preferred channel in we also acquired billion of student loans through two acquisitions 
we expect the growth in the demand for post secondary education to continue in the future due to a number of factors 
first  the college age population will continue to grow 
ed predicts that the college age population will increase percent by second  we project an increase in non traditional students those not attending college directly from high school and adult education 
third  tuition costs have risen percent for four year public institutions and percent for four year private institutions on an inflation adjusted basis since the academic year ay and are projected to continue to rise at a pace greater than inflation 
management believes that the twin factors of increasing demand for education coupled with rising tuition costs will drive growth in education financing well into the next decade 
during  we renegotiated our agreement with bank one 
under the current agreement we will purchase all bank one student loans originated on our platform through this volume represents the vast majority of loans originated under that brand name 
however  we are no longer obligated to promote the bank one brand on college campuses  allowing us to increase the marketing of the sallie mae family of brands as well as other lending partners 
over the past three years  we have seen a surge in consolidation loan activity as a result of historically low interest rates which has substantially changed the composition of our student loan portfolio 
consolidation loans earn a lower yield than ffelp stafford loans due primarily to the basis point consolidation loan rebate fee 
this negative impact is somewhat mitigated by higher sap spreads  the longer average life of consolidation loans and the greater potential to earn floor income 
since interest rates on consolidation loans are fixed to term for the borrower  older consolidation loans with higher borrower rates can earn floor income over an extended period of time 
in  substantially all floor income was earned on consolidation loans 
borrowers typically do not consolidate loans prior to repayment 
during  billion of ffelp stafford loans in our managed loan portfolio consolidated either with us billion or with other lenders billion 
the net result of consolidation activity in was a portfolio gain of million 
consolidation loans now represent over percent of our on balance sheet federally guaranteed student loan portfolio and over percent of our managed portfolio 
ffelp loan limits have not been raised since see other related events and information reauthorization and budget proposals for a description of proposals that would increase loan limits 
to meet the increasing cost of higher education  students and parents have turned to alternative sources of education financing 
a large and growing source of this supplemental education financing is provided through campus based private education loans  of which we are the largest provider 
the private education loan portfolio grew by percent in to billion and now represents percent of our managed student loan portfolio  up from percent in private education loans consist of two general types those that meet the needs of borrowers of higher education schools and other title iv eligible schools  and those that are used to meet the needs of students in alternative learning programs such as career training  distance learning and lifelong learning programs 
unlike ffelp loans  private education loans are subject to the full credit risk of the borrower 
we manage this additional risk through tested loan underwriting standards and a combination of higher interest rates and loan origination fees that compensate us for the higher risk 
as a result  we earn higher spreads on private education loans than on ffelp loans 
private education loans will continue to be an important driver of future earnings growth as the demand for post secondary education grows and costs increase much faster than increases in federal loan limits 
we also originate lesser quantities of mortgage and consumer loans with the intent of immediately selling the majority of the mortgage loans 
mortgage and consumer loan originations and the mortgage loan portfolio we hold were percent and percent  respectively  of total loan originations and total loans outstanding as of and for the year ended december  student loan spread an important performance measure closely monitored by management is the student loan spread 
the student loan spread is the difference between the interest earned on the student loan assets and the interest paid on the debt funding those loans 
a number of factors can affect the overall student loan spread such as the mix of student loans in the portfolio  with consolidation loans having the lowest spread and private education loans having the highest spread  the premiums paid and capitalized costs incurred to acquire student loans which negatively impact the spread through subsequent amortization  the type and level of borrower benefit programs  the level of floor income  and funding and hedging costs 
the replacement of gse debt with non gse debt has increased our funding costs and  coupled with the rapid growth in consolidation loans  has put pressure on our student loan spread 
we are actively managing these adverse effects by originating a higher percentage of student loans through our preferred channel and by increasing the percentage of private education loans in our managed portfolio 
absent changes to the spread through government legislation  see other related events and information reauthorization and budget proposals  we expect the managed student loan spread to remain close to the percent earned in the fourth quarter of funding and interest rate risk we depend on the debt capital markets to support our business plan 
we have developed diverse funding sources to ensure continued access to the capital markets now that we can no longer access gse funding 
our biggest funding challenge going forward is to maintain cost effective liquidity to fund the growth in the managed portfolio of student loans as well as to refinance previously securitized loans when consolidated back on balance sheet from our securitization trusts 
at the same time  we must maintain earnings spreads and control interest rate risk to preserve earnings growth 
our main source of funding is student loan securitizations and we have built a highly liquid market for such financings  as evidenced by the billion of student loans securitized in twelve term securitization transactions in and billion in sixteen term securitization transactions in while securitizations provide the majority of our funding requirements  we also rely on unsecured debt obligations as a source of liquidity 
in  we issued billion of slm corporation  term  unsecured debt raising the total of such debt to billion at december   a percent increase over december  in addition  in  we closed a billion asset backed commercial paper program and increased our revolving credit facility from billion to billion 
we rely heavily on derivative transactions to economically hedge our interest rate risk between our assets and liabilities 
derivatives allow us to efficiently match floating rate assets with floating rate debt and also better match the underlying indices of the variable rate assets and liabilities 
over the last three years  we have designed several new securitization structures to enable us to fund the longer average life of consolidation loans to terms 
in certain consolidation loan securitization structures  we do not qualify for off balance sheet accounting treatment and the consolidation loans remain on our balance sheet 
even though we believe our derivatives are economic hedges  changes in interest rates can cause volatility in our earnings for the market value of our derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
under sfas no 
 these changes in derivative market values are recorded through earnings with no consideration for the corresponding change in the fair value of the hedged item 
as a result  our earnings are highly susceptible to changes in interest rates caused by these one sided marks to market 
changes in interest rates can also have a material effect on the amount of floor income earned in our student loan portfolio and the valuation of our retained interest asset 
our earnings can also be materially affected by changes in our estimate of the rate at which loans may prepay in our portfolios as measured by the constant prepayment rate cpr 
the value of the retained interests on ffelp stafford securitizations is particularly affected by the level of consolidation loan activity 
we face a number of other challenges and risks that can materially affect our future results such as changes in applicable laws and regulations  which may change the volume  average term  effective yields and refinancing options of student loans under the ffelp or provide advantages to competing feelp and non ffelp loan providers  demand and competition for education financing  financing preferences of students and their families  borrower default rates on private education loans  continued access to the capital markets for funding at favorable spreads particularly for our non federally insured private education loan portfolio  and our operating execution and efficiencies  including errors  omissions  and effectiveness of internal control 
recent developments acquisitions in the lending business segment we completed two acquisitions in the lending business segment in and two acquisitions in we accounted for these transactions under the purchase method of accounting as defined in sfas no 
 business combinations  and allocated the purchase price to the fair market value of the assets acquired  including identifiable intangible assets and goodwill 
southwest student services corporation on october   we completed our purchase of the outstanding stock of southwest student services corporation southwest  an originator  holder and servicer of student loans from the helios education foundation for total consideration of approximately million including cash of million and restricted stock of million 
the transaction included southwest s billion student loan portfolio and the related funding  its arizona based loan origination and servicing center and its sales and marketing operations 
in addition to increasing our student loan portfolio  the purchase has expanded our loan origination capability and broadened our market reach 
southwest is among the top originators of federal student loans  issuing approximately million in ffelp stafford and plus loans and billion in consolidation loans annually  and it is the nation s ninth largest holder of federal student loans 
southwest provides student loans and related services nationally with a primary focus on colleges and universities in arizona and florida 
southwest employs nearly individuals 
education assistance foundation and student loan finance association on december   we closed the first step in a two step purchase of the secondary market and related businesses of education assistance foundation eaf and its affiliate  student loan finance association slfa for a purchase price of approximately million 
as specified in the purchase agreement  concurrent with the consummation of the transaction  the sellers used million of the purchase price to defease the debt funding certain loans acquired by the company as part of this transaction 
slfa is a northwest regional leader in education loan funding and acquisition 
the first step of the transaction included slfa s billion student loan portfolio and the related funding and its origination franchise 
in addition  as a part of this transaction  we entered into a full service guarantor servicing contract with eaf s affiliate  northwest education association nela  a guarantee agency for ffelp student loans that serves the pacific northwest 
in a related transaction  nela became an affiliate of usa funds  the company s largest guarantor servicing client 
the second step of the transaction is expected to close in academic management services corporation on november   the company purchased all of the outstanding stock of academic management services corporation ams for a purchase price of approximately million including cash consideration and certain acquisition costs 
we allocated the purchase price primarily to the billion student loan portfolio and intangible assets including goodwill 
in addition to the student loan portfolio  the purchase expanded our loan origination capability and enhanced our offerings to college and university business offices 
debt management operations dmo business segment in our dmo business segment  we have traditionally provided portfolio management  debt collection and default prevention services on a contingency fee basis  concentrating primarily in the education finance marketplace 
our investment in afs holdings  llc  the parent company of arrow financial services collectively  afs  has expanded our capabilities such that we now purchase delinquent and defaulted receivables and earn revenues from collections on those portfolios 
of our service areas  the contingency collections business is the most mature 
while student loan contingency collections and other fee services will continue to be the core of dmo fee income  purchased portfolio revenue  primarily from credit card accounts  is expected to account for a larger component of dmo revenue in the future 
the private sector collections industry is highly fragmented with few large public companies and a large number of small scale privately held companies 
the collections industry segments that provide third party collections services for ed  ffelp guarantors and other federal holders of defaulted debt are highly competitive 
among the asset classes  credit card collections are the most competitive in both contingency collections and purchased paper activities 
in the education finance marketplace  we are subject to the political risks associated with the ffelp as they relate to guarantors  our primary customers 
an example of this risk is the proposed reduction in collections revenues in the president s proposed budget for federal fiscal year ffy see other related events and information reauthorization and budget proposals 
in the purchased receivables business we have experienced increased competition in bidding for portfolio purchases  which has driven up prices in competitive bidding situations 
we are responding to this challenge through enhanced servicing efficiencies and continuing to build on customer relationships through value added services 
recent developments acquisitions in the dmo business segment afs holdings  llc on september   we acquired percent of afs  a full service  accounts receivable management company that purchases charged off debt  conducts contingency collection work and performs first party receivables servicing across asset classes  for a purchase price of approximately million including cash consideration and certain acquisition costs 
under the terms of the agreement  we have the option to purchase the remaining interest in afs holdings  llc over a three year period 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase accounting method 
afs employs nearly  individuals at locations in niles  illinois  gaithersburg  maryland  san diego  california  whitewater  wisconsin  and rockville centre  new york 
it will retain its brand and senior management team 
afs primarily purchases and services defaulted consumer receivables from credit grantors or resellers and then focuses its collection efforts to cover its investment and earn a sufficient return from the purchased portfolio 
afs also collects on behalf of debt owners on a contingency fee basis and provides first party delinquent and default receivables servicing 
the purchased receivables business has potential for greater profitability than the contingency fee business due in large part to the maturity of the contingency business and the pricing risks and rewards associated with purchasing delinquent or defaulted debt 
our acquisition of afs was important for two main reasons 
it has further diversified our dmo revenues outside of the education marketplace and provides a disciplined pricing framework and servicing platform as well as years of experience in the purchase of delinquent and defaulted receivables 
the addition of afs also enables us to offer the purchase of distress or defaulted debt to our partner schools as an additional method of enhancing their receivables management strategies 
corporate and other business segment our corporate and other business segment reflects the aggregate activity of our smaller operating units including our guarantor servicing and loan servicing business units  other products and services  as well as corporate expenses that do not pertain directly to our business segments 
in our guarantor servicing business unit  we provide a full complement of administrative services to ffelp guarantors including guarantee issuance  processing  account maintenance  and guarantee fulfillment 
in our loan servicing business unit  we originate and service student loans on behalf of lenders who are unrelated to slm corporation 
such activities include processing correspondence and filing claims  originating and disbursing consolidation loans on behalf of the lender  and other administrative activities required by ed 
critical accounting policies and estimates the md a discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions 
note to the consolidated financial statements  significant accounting policies  includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  particularly those that include the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and are often about matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates relate to the following accounting policies that are discussed in more detail below securitization accounting and retained interests  loan effective interest method premium borrower benefits  provision for loan losses  and derivative accounting 
also  as part of our regular quarterly evaluation of the critical estimates used by the company  we have updated a number of estimates to account for the increase in consolidation loan activity 
premiums  discounts and borrower benefits for both federally insured and private education loans  we account for premiums paid  discounts received and certain origination costs incurred on the origination and acquisition of student loans in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases 
the unamortized portion of the premiums and the discounts is included in the carrying value of the student loan on the consolidated balance sheet 
we recognize income on our student loan portfolio based on the expected yield of the student loan after giving effect to the amortization and accretion of purchase premiums and student loan discounts  as well as the borrower benefit discount 
in arriving at the expected yield  we must make a number of estimates that when changed must be reflected in the balance from the inception of the student loan 
the most sensitive estimate for premium and discount amortization is the estimate of the cpr  which measures the rate at which loans in the portfolio pay before their stated maturity 
the cpr is used in calculating the average life of the portfolio 
a number of factors can affect the cpr estimate such as the rate of consolidation loan activity  securitization activity and default rates 
changes in cpr estimates are discussed in more detail below 
in addition to the cpr  the estimate of the borrower benefit discount is dependent on the estimate of the number of borrowers who will eventually qualify for these benefits 
for competitive purposes  we frequently change the borrower benefit programs in both amount and qualification factors 
these programmatic changes must be reflected in the estimate of the borrower benefit discount 
effects of consolidation loan activity on estimates the combination of aggressive marketing in the student loan industry and the ability to obtain a long term  fixed rate loan at low interest rates has led to continued high levels of consolidation loan volume  which  in turn  has had a significant effect on a number of accounting estimates in recent years 
as long as interest rates remain at historically low levels  and absent any changes in the hea  we expect the consolidation loan program to continue to be an attractive option for borrowers 
we have updated our assumptions that are affected primarily by consolidation loan activity and updated the estimates used in developing the cash flows and effective yield calculations as they relate to the amortization of student loan premiums and discounts  borrower benefits  residual interest income and the valuation of the residual interest 
loan consolidation activity affects each estimate differently depending on whether the original ffelp stafford loans being consolidated were on balance sheet or off balance sheet and whether the resulting consolidation loan is retained by us or consolidated with a third party 
when we consolidate a ffelp stafford loan that was in our portfolio  the term of that loan is extended and the term of the amortization of the capitalized acquisition costs premium is likewise extended to match the new term of the loan 
in that process the premium must be adjusted from inception to reflect the new term of the consolidated loan 
the schedule below summarizes the impact of loan consolidation on each affected financial statement line item 
consolidation loans in securitizations the estimate of the cpr also affects the estimate of the average life of securitized trusts and therefore affects the valuation estimate of the residual interest 
prepayments shorten the average life of the trust  and if all other factors remain equal  will reduce the value of the residual interest asset  the securitization gain on sale and the effective yield used to recognize interest income 
prepayments on student loans in securitized trusts are primarily driven by the rate at which securitized ffelp stafford loans are consolidated 
when a loan is consolidated from the trust either by us or a third party  the loan is treated as a prepayment 
in cases where the loan is consolidated by us  it will be recorded as an on balance sheet asset 
we discuss the effects of changes in our cpr estimates in results of operations lending business segment student loans and results of operations liquidity and capital resources securitization activities

decrease in prospective effective yield used to recognize interest income 
securitization accounting and retained interests we regularly engage in securitization transactions as part of our financing strategy 
as described in more detail in results of operations liquidity and capital resources securitization activities  in a securitization we sell student loans to a trust that issues bonds backed by the student loans as part of the transaction 
when our securitizations meet the sale criteria of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of sfas no 
 we record a gain on the sale of the student loans which is the difference between the allocated cost basis of the assets sold and the relative fair value of the assets received 
the primary judgment in determining the fair value of the assets received is the valuation of the residual interest 
the retained interests in each of our securitizations are treated as available for sale securities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and therefore must be marked to market with temporary unrealized gains and losses recognized  net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
since there are no quoted market prices for our retained interests  we estimate their fair value both initially and each subsequent quarter using the key assumptions listed below the projected net interest yield from the underlying securitized loans  which can be impacted by the forward yield curve  the calculation of the embedded floor income associated with the securitized loan portfolio  the cpr  the discount rate used  which is intended to be commensurate with the risks involved  and the expected credit losses from the underlying securitized loan portfolio 
we recognize interest income and periodically evaluate our retained interests for other than temporary impairment in accordance with the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
under this standard  on a quarterly basis we estimate the cash flows to be received from our retained interests and these revised cash flows are used prospectively to calculate a yield for income recognition 
in cases where our estimate of future cash flows results in a decrease in the yield used to recognize interest income compared to the prior quarter  the retained interest is written down to fair value  first to the extent of any unrealized gain in accumulated other comprehensive income  then through earnings as an other than temporary impairment 
these estimates are the same as those used for the valuation of the residual interest discussed above 
we also receive income for servicing the loans in our securitization trusts 
we assess the amounts received as compensation for these activities at inception and on an ongoing basis to determine if the amounts received are adequate compensation as defined in sfas no 
to the extent such compensation is determined to be no more or less than adequate compensation  no servicing asset or obligation is recorded 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses represents the periodic expense of maintaining an allowance sufficient to absorb losses  net of recoveries  inherent in the student loan portfolios 
the allowance for private education loan losses is an estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date that will be charged off in subsequent periods 
we estimate our losses using historical data from our private education loan portfolios  extrapolations of ffelp loan loss data  current trends and relevant industry information 
as our private education loan portfolios continue to mature  more reliance is placed on our own historic private education loan charge off and recovery data 
accordingly  during the third quarter of  we updated our expected default assumptions to further align the allowance estimate with our collection experience and the terms and policies of the individual private education loan programs 
we use this data in internally developed models to estimate the amount of losses  net of subsequent collections  projected to occur in the private education loan portfolios 
when calculating the private education loan loss reserve  we divide the portfolio into categories of similar risk characteristics based on loan program type  underwriting criteria  existence or absence of a co borrower  repayment begin date  repayment status  and aging 
we then apply default and collection rate projections to each category 
the repayment begin date indicates when the borrower is required to begin repaying their loan 
our career training private education loan programs percent of the managed private education loan portfolio at december  generally require the borrowers to start repaying their loans immediately 
our higher education private education loan programs percent of the managed private education loan portfolio at december  do not require the borrowers to begin repayment until six months after they have graduated or otherwise left school 
consequently  our loss estimates for these programs are minimal while the borrower is in school 
at december   percent of the principal balance in the higher education managed private education loan portfolio related to borrowers who are still in school and not required to make payments 
as the current portfolio ages  an increasing percentage of the borrowers will leave school and be required to begin payments on their loans 
the allowance for losses will change accordingly with the percentage of borrowers in repayment 
our loss estimates include losses to be incurred over the loss confirmation period  which is two years for career training loans beginning when the loan is originated and five years for higher education loans beginning when the borrower leaves school 
similar to the rules governing ffelp payment requirements  our collection policies allow for periods of nonpayment for borrowers requesting additional payment grace periods upon leaving school or experiencing temporary difficulty meeting payment obligations 
this is referred to as forbearance status 
the vast majority of forbearance occurs early in the repayment term when borrowers are starting their careers see results of operations lending business segment student loans delinquencies 
at december   percent of the managed private education loan portfolio was in forbearance status 
the loss confirmation period is in alignment with our typical collection cycle and takes into account these periods of nonpayment 
private education loan principal is charged off against the allowance at days delinquency 
private education loans continue to accrue interest  including in periods of forbearance  until they are charged off and removed from the active portfolio  at which time the accrued interest is charged off against interest income 
recoveries on loans charged off are recorded directly to the allowance 
effective for a renewable one year period beginning on october   sallie mae  inc s loan servicing division  sallie mae servicing  was designated as an exceptional performer ep by ed in recognition of meeting certain performance standards set by ed in servicing ffelp loans 
as a result of this designation  the company receives percent reimbursement on default claims on federally guaranteed student loans that are serviced by sallie mae servicing for a period of at least days before the date of default and will no longer be subject to the two percent risk sharing on these loans 
the company is entitled to receive this benefit as long as the company remains in compliance with the required servicing standards  which are assessed on an annual and quarterly basis through compliance audits and other criteria 
the percent reimbursement applies to all ffelp loans that are serviced by the company as well as default claims on federally guaranteed student loans that the company owns but are serviced by other service providers with the ep designation 
at december   approximately percent of the company s on balance sheet federally insured loans are no longer subject to risk sharing 
as a result of this designation  the company has reduced the balance in the allowance for loan losses by million 
accordingly  the evaluation of the provision for loan losses is inherently subjective  as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant changes 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is appropriate to cover probable losses in the student loan portfolio 
derivative accounting we use interest rate swaps  foreign currency swaps  interest rate futures contracts  floor income contracts and interest rate cap contracts as an integral part of our overall risk management strategy to manage interest rate risk arising from our fixed rate and floating rate financial instruments 
we account for these instruments in accordance with sfas no 
which requires that every derivative instrument  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability 
we determine the fair value for our derivative instruments using pricing models that consider current market values and the contractual terms of the derivative contracts 
pricing models and their underlying assumptions impact the amount and timing of unrealized gains and losses recognized  the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different financial results 
as a matter of policy  we compare the fair values of our derivatives that we calculate to those provided by our counterparties on a monthly basis 
any significant differences are identified and resolved appropriately 
we make certain judgments in the application of hedge accounting under sfas no 
the most significant judgment relates to the application of hedge accounting in connection with our forecasted debt issuances 
under sfas no 
 if the forecasted transaction is probable to occur then hedge accounting may be applied 
we regularly update our probability assessment related to such forecasted debt issuances 
this assessment includes analyzing prior debt issuances and assessing changes in our future funding strategies 
sfas no 
requires that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria as specified by sfas no 
are met 
we believe that all of our derivatives are effective economic hedges and are a critical element of our interest rate risk management strategy 
however  under sfas no 
 some of our derivatives  primarily floor income contracts  certain eurodollar futures contracts  certain basis swaps and equity forwards  do not qualify for hedge treatment under sfas no 
therefore  changes in market value along with the periodic net settlements must be recorded through the derivative market value adjustment in the income statement with no consideration for the corresponding change in fair value of the hedged item 
the derivative market value adjustment is primarily caused by interest rate volatility and changing credit spreads during the period and the volume and term of derivatives not receiving hedge accounting treatment

since these business segments operate in distinct business environments  after a general discussion of the consolidated results of operations  the discussion herein of the results of our operations is primarily presented on a segment basis 
the lending business segment includes all discussion of income and related expenses associated with net interest margin  student loan spread and its components  securitization gains and the ongoing servicing and securitization income  derivative market value gains and losses  and other fees earned on our managed portfolio of student loans 
the dmo business segment reflects the fees earned and expenses incurred to operate our dmo business

consolidated earnings summary the main drivers of our net income are the growth in our managed student loan portfolio  which drives net interest income and securitization transactions  market value gains and losses on derivatives that do not receive hedge accounting treatment  the timing and size of securitization gains  growth in our fee based business and expense control 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended december   our net income was billion diluted earnings per share versus net income of billion diluted earnings per share in the increase in net income from to is due to several factors 
the principal driver of the growth in net income was a billion pre tax increase in the derivative market value adjustment 
the derivative market value gain can primarily be attributed to the positive effect that the increase in forward interest rates had on the valuation of our floor income contracts and to gains on our equity forward contracts caused by the increase in the market value of our common stock 
in  other income which includes guarantor servicing fees  debt management fees and collections revenue  and other fee based income increased by percent to million versus this increase can mainly be attributed to an increase in revenue from our dmo segment  late and other borrower fees and to termination fees from bank one 
in  other income benefited from a million gain on the sale of our prior headquarters building 
the year over year increases in other income were offset by million in lower securitization gains due to consolidation loan securitizations not qualifying for off balance sheet treatment and million in lower servicing and securitization revenue due to primarily lower embedded floor income 
net income in was also negatively impacted by a million pre tax loss related to the repurchase and defeasance of billion of gse debt in connection with the gse wind down and a percent increase in other operating expenses to million versus this increase can be attributed to acquisitions and increased servicing and debt management expenses consistent with the growth in borrowers and the growth in the debt management business 
also  in  net interest income after provision for loan losses was relatively flat versus caused by two offsetting factors the increase in net interest income  driven by an billion increase in our average balance of on balance sheet student loans  and offset by the reduction in floor income caused by higher interest rates 
our managed student loan portfolio grew by billion  from billion at december  to billion at december  this growth was fueled by the billion in new managed student loans acquired in  a percent increase over the billion acquired in in  we originated billion of student loans through our preferred channel  an increase of percent over the billion originated in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income for the year ended december  was billion diluted earnings per share versus million diluted earnings per share in the increase in net income from to is mainly due to an increase in securitization gains  a pre tax million reduction in the loss on the derivative market value adjustment  an increase in fee based income  and a million unrealized gain on our equity forward positions  which was reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change for the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
these increases were offset by decreases in student loan income  decreases in servicing and securitization revenue resulting from changes in accounting estimates in the fourth quarter of  reduced levels of floor income  an increase in operating expenses due to the acquisitions  and increases in debt management and servicing expenses consistent with the growth in the debt management business 
for the year ended december   managed student loans increased percent in to billion at december  in  we acquired billion of student loans  a percent increase over the billion acquired in of the student loans acquired  we originated billion through our preferred channel  an increase of percent over the billion originated in lending business segment the following table includes the results of operations for our lending business segment

the decrease in the net interest margin was also due to the effect of the gse wind down 
without the low funding cost provided by the gse  the margin on our highly liquid  short term investments turns negative 
also  we have replaced short term gse financing with longer term more expensive non gse financing 
student loans for both federally insured student loans and private education loans  we account for premiums paid  discounts received and certain origination costs incurred on the origination and acquisition of student loans in accordance with sfas no 
the unamortized portion of the premiums and discounts are included in the carrying value of the student loan on the consolidated balance sheet 
we recognize income on our student loan portfolio based on the expected yield of the student loan after giving effect to the amortization of purchase premiums and the accretion of student loan discounts  as well as the discount expected to be earned through borrower benefit programs 
discounts on private education loans are deferred and accreted to income over the lives of the student loans 
in the table below  this accretion of discounts is netted with the amortization of the premiums 
student loan spread analysis on balance sheet the following table analyzes the reported earnings from student loans both on balance sheet and those off balance sheet in securitization trusts 
for student loans off balance sheet  we will continue to earn securitization and servicing fee revenues over the life of the securitized loan portfolios 
the off balance sheet information is discussed in more detail in liquidity and capital resources securitization activities servicing and securitization revenue where we analyze the on going servicing revenue and residual interest earned on the securitized portfolios of student loans

in  and  we earned gross floor income of million basis points  million basis points and million basis points  respectively 
the reduction in floor income is due to the increase in short term interest rates in we believe that we have economically hedged most of the floor income through the sale of floor income contracts 
when we sell a floor income contract we receive an upfront fee and agree to pay the counterparty the floor income earned on a notional amount of student loans 
these contracts do not qualify for accounting hedge treatment and as a result are excluded from net interest income and from the above student loan spread analysis 
instead  payments of floor income under these contracts are required to be reported with other cumulative realized and unrealized gains and losses in the derivative market value adjustment line in the income statement 
for the years ended december   and  net floor income for on balance sheet student loans was million basis points  million basis points and million basis points  respectively 
payments on floor income contracts associated with on balance sheet student loans for the years ended december   and totaled million basis points  million basis points and million basis points  respectively 
in addition to floor income contracts  we also extensively use basis swaps to manage our basis risk associated with interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
these swaps also do not qualify as accounting hedges and are likewise required to be accounted for in the derivative market value adjustment and not part of the cost of funds in the above table 
had net settlements of these swaps been included with the associated debt  our on balance sheet cost of funds would have been percent  percent and percent  respectively  for the years ended december   and discussion of the year over year effect of changes in accounting estimates on the on balance sheet student loan spread as discussed in detail and summarized in a table under critical accounting policies and estimates  we periodically update our estimates for changes in the student loan portfolio 
under sfas no 
 these changes in estimates must be reflected in the balance of the student loan from inception 
we have also updated our estimates to reflect programmatic changes in our borrower benefit and private education loan programs and have made modeling refinements to better reflect current and future conditions 
the effects of the changes in estimates on the student loan spread are summarized in the table below years ended december  dollars in millions dollar value basis points dollar value basis points changes in critical accounting estimates effect on premium discount ffelp stafford and consolidation loans private education loans total effect on premium discount borrower benefits total changes in estimates in  based on our ongoing analysis of our private education loan portfolio  we determined that the portfolio was repaying slower than previously estimated  and in response we increased the period for which we amortize student loan discounts resulting in an increase to the unamortized student loan discount balance of million during in response to the continued high rate of consolidation loan activity  we lowered our estimate of the number of stafford borrowers who will eventually qualify for borrower benefits and revised the term over which benefits are expected to be realized 
as a result  we recorded a million reduction in the liability for borrower benefits 
the net effect of these updates to our estimates in was a million or basis point reduction in the student loan spread 
in  we updated our estimates to reflect the increase in consolidation loan activity 
we decreased the cpr for ffelp stafford loans to reflect the extension of the term of these loans when consolidated into a sallie mae consolidation loan  which results in an increase to the unamortized student loan premium 
at the same time  we increased the cpr for the consolidation loan portfolio  which had the opposite effect on the premium balance and premium amortization 
the net effect of these changes was a million adjustment to decrease the unamortized student loan premium and increase current period amortization expense 
we also decreased our estimate of the cpr associated with our private education loan program to reflect slower than anticipated repayments resulting in a million increase in the unamortized student loan discount 
also  in  we reduced our estimate of the number of borrowers who eventually qualify for ffelp stafford borrower benefits resulting in a million estimate adjustment to reduce the estimated borrower benefit liability and increase student loan income 
the net effect of these updates to our estimates in was a million or basis point reduction in the student loan spread 
discussion of year over year fluctuations in on balance sheet student loan spread in addition to changes in accounting estimates the decrease in the student loan spread versus the prior year is primarily due to the higher average balance of consolidation loans as a percentage of the on balance sheet portfolio 
consolidation loans have lower spreads than other ffelp loans due to the basis point consolidation loan rebate fee  more robust borrower benefits  and higher funding costs due to their longer terms 
these negative effects are partially offset by lower student loan premium amortization due to the extended term and a higher sap yield 
the average balance of consolidation loans grew as a percentage of the average on balance sheet ffelp student loan portfolio from percent in to percent in other factors that negatively impacted the student loan spread are lower floor income due to higher average interest rates  higher spreads on our debt funding student loans as a result of the gse wind down  and higher borrower benefit costs 
these negative factors were partially offset by the absence of offset fees on gse financed loans and higher student loan yields 
the increase in funding costs is due to the replacement of lower cost  primarily short term gse funding with longer term  higher cost non gse funding 
in  gse liabilities were heavily weighted to short term in anticipation of the gse wind down 
the increase in borrower benefit costs can be attributable to an increase in the estimate of borrowers qualifying for the benefit and to changes to certain programs that shorten the periods required to qualify  primarily as they relate to consolidation loans 
these changes had a greater effect on the on balance sheet student loan spread due to the higher percentage of consolidation loans 
these negative effects were partially offset by the increase in private education loans in the on balance sheet student loan portfolio and lower net premium discount amortization 
in addition to the effects of estimate adjustments  the student loan spread decreased by basis points from to this decrease was primarily due to the higher average balance of consolidation loans  lower floor income and higher funding spreads on the debt 
these negative effects were partially offset by the increase in private education loans in the on balance sheet student loan portfolio

under sfas no 
 these changes in estimates must be reflected in the balance from inception of the student loan 
we have also updated our estimates to reflect programmatic changes in our borrower benefit and private education loan programs and have made modeling refinements to better reflect current and future conditions 
the effects of the changes in estimates are summarized in the table below years ended december  dollars in millions dollar value basis points dollar value basis points changes in critical accounting estimates effect on premium discount ffelp stafford and consolidation loans private education loans total effect on premium discount borrower benefits total changes in estimates in  we updated our estimates of average life associated with our ffelp stafford and consolidation loan programs 
the net effect of these changes was a million adjustment to increase the unamortized student loan premium 
the difference between the effect for on balance sheet and off balance sheet was primarily due to a refinement in our estimates for off balance sheet loans that did not have the same effect on balance sheet and to the different mix of ffelp stafford and consolidation loans on balance sheet versus the mix on a managed basis 
in  based on our ongoing analysis of our managed private education loan portfolio  we determined that the portfolio was repaying at a slower rate than previously estimated 
in response  we increased the period for which we amortize student loan discounts resulting in an increase to the unamortized student loan discount balance of million during additionally  the continued high rate of consolidation loan activity results in fewer stafford borrowers qualifying for borrower benefits 
in response to this trend  we lowered our estimate of the number of stafford borrowers who will eventually qualify for borrower benefits and revised the term over which benefits are expected to be realized 
as a result  we recorded a million reduction in the liability for borrower benefits during the net effect of these updates to our estimates in was a million or basis point increase in the managed student loan spread 
in  we made similar updates to our estimates of the cpr to reflect the effect of the increase in consolidation loan activity on our ffelp stafford and consolidation loan portfolios 
the net effect of these changes was a million adjustment to increase the unamortized student loan premium and decrease current period amortization expense 
we also updated our estimate of the cpr associated with our private education loan program which resulted in a million adjustment to increase the unamortized student loan discount and decrease current period discount amortization 
also  in  we reduced our estimate of the number of borrowers who eventually qualify for ffelp stafford borrower benefits resulting in a million adjustment to reduce the estimated borrower benefit liability and increase student loan income 
the net effect of these updates to our estimates in was a million or basis point increase in the student loan spread 
discussion of year over year fluctuations in managed student loan spread in addition to changes in accounting estimates the decrease in the student loan spread versus  in addition to the changes in estimates disclosed above  is primarily due to the higher average balance of consolidation loans as a percentage of the managed portfolio 
consolidation loans have lower spreads than other ffelp loans due to the basis point consolidation loan rebate fee  higher qualification rates for borrower benefits  and higher funding costs due to their longer terms 
these negative effects are partially offset by lower student loan premium amortization due to the extended term and a higher sap yield 
the average balance of consolidation loans grew as a percentage of the average managed ffelp student loan portfolio from percent in to percent in our student loan spread was negatively impacted by higher spreads on our debt funding student loans  which was partially offset by the absence of offset fees on gse financed loans 
the increase in funding costs is due to the replacement of lower cost primarily short term gse funding with longer term  higher cost non gse funding in connection with the gse wind down 
the student loan spread benefited from the increase in the average balance of managed private education loans as a percentage of the average managed student loan portfolio from percent in to percent in private education loans are subject to credit risk and therefore earn higher spreads which averaged percent for the year ended december  versus a spread of percent for the managed guaranteed student loan portfolio 
in addition to the estimate adjustments discussed above  the increase in the student loan spread versus was due to the increase in the percentage of private education loans in the managed student loan portfolio partially offset by the higher credit spreads on the debt funding student loans due to the gse wind down  and the increase of consolidation loans as a percentage of the total portfolio 
floor income for on balance sheet student loans  gross floor income is included in student loan income whereas payments on floor income contracts are included in the derivative market value adjustment line in other income

as discussed in more detail under liquidity and capital resources securitization activities  when we securitize a portfolio of student loans  we estimate the future fixed rate embedded floor income earned on off balance sheet student loans using a discounted cash flow option pricing model and recognize the fair value of such cash flows in the initial gain on sale and subsequent valuations of the residual interest 
variable rate embedded floor income is recognized as earned in servicing and securitization revenue 
the decrease in variable rate floor income in versus is primarily due to the decline in treasury bill and commercial paper rates from the july  reset of borrower rates  which resulted in million of variable rate floor income earned in the first half of treasury bill and commercial paper rates did not decline as steeply in the second half of or in the increase in fixed rate floor income is primarily due to the increase in the average balance of consolidation loans  partially offset by slightly higher treasury bill rates

the following table summarizes changes in the allowance for private education loan losses for the years ended december   and activity in allowance for private education loan losses on balance sheet off balance sheet managed basis years ended december  years ended december  years ended december  allowance at beginning of year provision for loan losses other charge offs recoveries net charge offs balance before securitization of private education loans reduction for securitization of private education loans allowance at end of year net charge offs as a percentage of average loans in repayment allowance as a percentage of the ending total loan balance allowance as a percentage of ending loans in repayment allowance coverage of net charge offs average total loans ending total loans average loans in repayment ending loans in repayment the allowance for private education loan losses is an estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date that will be charged off in subsequent periods 
we estimate our losses using historical data from our private education loan portfolios  extrapolations of ffelp loan loss data  current trends and relevant industry information 
as our private education loan portfolios continue to mature  more reliance is placed on our own historic private education loan charge off and recovery data 
we use this data in internally developed models to estimate losses  net of subsequent collections  projected to occur in the private education loan portfolios 
on balance sheet versus managed presentation all private education loans are initially acquired on balance sheet 
when we securitize private education loans  we reduce the on balance sheet allowance for amounts previously provided for in the allowance and then provide for these loans in the managed presentation only as they are no longer legally owned by the company 
when private education loans in securitized trusts become days delinquent  we typically exercise our contingent call option to repurchase these loans at par value out of the trust and record a loss for the difference in the par value paid and the fair market value of the loan at the time of purchase 
if these loans reach the day delinquency  a charge off for the remaining balance of the loan is triggered 
on a managed basis  the losses recorded under gaap at the time of repurchase of delinquent private education loans are considered charge offs when the delinquent private education loans reach the day charge off date 
these charge offs are shown in the off balance sheet section in the above table 
the off balance sheet allowance is increasing as more loans are securitized but is lower than the on balance sheet percentage when measured as a percentage of ending loans in repayment because of the different mix of loans on balance sheet and off balance sheet 
certain loan types with higher expected default rates  such as career training  have not yet been securitized 
additionally  a larger percentage of the off balance sheet loan borrowers are still in school status and not required to make payments on their loans 
once repayment begins  the allowance requirements increase to reflect the increased risk of loss as loans enter repayment 
managed basis private education loan loss allowance discussion the increase in the provision for managed private education loans of million from to is primarily due to the billion increase in managed private education loans that have transitioned to out of school status over the prior year 
for the year ended december   private education loan charge offs increased by million over the prior year  which is due primarily to the continued growth and maturity of loans in repayment 
as discussed further below  while the delinquency and forbearance amounts fluctuate from quarter to quarter  they will increase with the growth in the repayment portfolio 
we utilize the expertise of our collection organization  including our debt management operation  to minimize charge offs in our own portfolio and to increase recoveries on charged off loans 
the allowance as a percentage of loans in repayment decreased year over year from percent to percent 
this reduction is primarily attributable to the changing mix of the portfolio and the updates in our default assumptions in the third quarter of delinquencies the table below presents our private education loan delinquency trends as of december   and delinquencies have the potential to adversely impact earnings through increased servicing and collection costs in the event the delinquent accounts charge off

loans for borrowers who have requested extension of grace period during employment transition or who have temporarily ceased making full payments due to hardship or other factors  consistent with the established loan program servicing policies and procedures 
the period of delinquency is based on the number of days scheduled payments are contractually past due 
the improvement in the percentage of delinquent loans is primarily due to enhanced default efforts that commenced in the second quarter of forbearance managed basis private education loans private education loans are made to parent and student borrowers by our lender partners in accordance with our underwriting policies 
these loans generally supplement federally guaranteed student loans  which are subject to federal lending caps 
private education loans are not guaranteed or insured against any loss of principal or interest 
traditional student borrowers use the proceeds of these loans to obtain higher education  which increases the likelihood of obtaining employment at higher income levels than would be available without the additional education 
as a result  the borrowers repayment capability improves between the time the loan is made and the time they enter the post education work force 
we generally allow the loan repayment period on traditional private education loans  except those generated by slm financial loans  to begin six to nine months after the student leaves school 
this provides the borrower time to obtain a job to service his or her debt 
for borrowers that need more time or experience other hardships  we permit additional payment deferments or partial payments both referred to as forbearances when we believe additional time will improve the borrower s ability to repay the loan 
our policy does not grant any reduction in the repayment obligation principal or interest but does allow the borrower to stop or reduce monthly payments for an agreed period of time 
forbearance is used most heavily immediately after the loan enters repayment 
at december   approximately percent of borrowers currently in forbearance have deferred their loan repayment less than months 
further  approximately percent have been in repayment less than months 
these borrowers are essentially extending their grace period as they transition to the workforce 
forbearance continues to be a positive collection tool for the private education loans as we believe it can provide the borrower with sufficient time to obtain employment and income to support his or her obligation 
we consider the potential impact of forbearance in the determination of the loan loss reserves 
loans in forbearance status decreased from percent of loans in repayment and forbearance status at december  to percent of loans in repayment and forbearance status at december  the decrease in the percentages of loans in forbearance status is primarily due to enhanced collection and default prevention efforts

allowance for ffelp student loan losses effective for a renewable one year period beginning on october   sallie mae  inc  which includes the company s student loan servicing division sallie mae servicing  was designated as an exceptional performer by ed in recognition of meeting certain performance standards set by ed in servicing ffelp loans 
as a result of this designation  the company receives percent reimbursement on default claims on federally guaranteed student loans that are serviced by sallie mae servicing for a period of at least days before the date of default 
we are entitled to receive this benefit as long as we remain in compliance with the required servicing standards  which are assessed on an annual and quarterly basis through compliance audits and other criteria 
the exceptional performer designation also applies to all ffelp loans that we own but are serviced by other service providers with the exceptional performer designation

versus operating expenses for the year ended december  were million versus million in the prior year

debt management operations dmo business segment through the five operating units that comprise our dmo business segment  we provide a wide range of accounts receivable and collections services including defaulted student loan portfolio management services  contingency collections services for student loans and other asset classes  student loan default aversion services  and accounts receivable management and collection for purchased portfolios of receivables that have been charged off by their original creditors 
the majority of our revenues are generated through our contingency fee business in which we provide default management services to guarantor agencies  colleges and universities  ed  and other consumer credit companies 
in the purchased receivables business  we focus on all types of consumer debt with an emphasis on charged off credit card receivables 
we purchase these portfolios at a substantial discount to their face value 
we then use both our internal collections operations and external collections efforts to maximize the recovery on these receivables 
effectively pricing the portfolio is a major success factor in the purchased receivables business 
we conduct a quantitative and qualitative analysis using our proprietary models to appropriately price each portfolio to yield a return consistent with our earnings hurdles 
we account for our investments in charged off receivables in accordance with practice bulletin  amortization of discounts on certain acquired loans  whereby we establish static pools of relatively homogeneous accounts and initially record them at cost 
we then recognize income each month based on each static pool s effective interest rate 
monthly cash collections are all allocated to revenue and principal reduction based on the estimated internal rate of return 
the static pools are tested monthly for impairment 
revenues from usa funds represented percent  percent  and percent  respectively  of total dmo revenue in   and we expect the percentage of revenue generated from services provided to usa funds to decrease considerably in due primarily to the impact of our acquisition of afs and the inclusion of the purchased receivables business revenues

our growth rate was slowed by the greater emphasis on rehabilitating defaulted ffelp loans versus consolidating them with other lenders 
this strategy ultimately produces higher margins but initially it lengthens the revenue cycle

the increase in dmo contingency fee expenses is consistent with the growth in revenue and accounts serviced  as a high percentage of dmo expenses are variable contributing to our stable margins 
we continue to make substantial investments in the infrastructure of the dmo business to accommodate current and future growth and we believe this will provide significant operating efficiencies in the future

adopted in the third quarter of alternative performance measures in accordance with the rules and regulations of the sec  we prepare financial statements in accordance with gaap 
in addition to evaluating the company s gaap based financial information  management  credit rating agencies  lenders and analysts also evaluate the company on certain non gaap performance measures that we refer to as core cash measures 
while core cash measures are not a substitute for reported results under gaap  we rely on core cash measures in operating our business because we believe they provide additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely assessed by management 
our pro forma core cash measures are the primary financial performance measures used by management to evaluate performance and to allocate resources 
accordingly  financial information is reported to management on a core cash basis by reportable segment 
in note to our consolidated financial statements  segment reporting  we provide a consolidated statement of income by reportable segment on a core cash basis  as these are the measures used regularly by our chief operating decision makers 
our core cash measures are used in developing our financial plans and tracking results  and also in establishing corporate performance targets and determining incentive compensation 
management believes this information provides additional insight into the financial performance of the company s core business activities 
our core cash measures are not defined terms within gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
core cash measures reflect only current period adjustments to gaap as described below 
accordingly  the company s core cash measures presentation does not represent another comprehensive basis of accounting 
a more detailed discussion of the differences between gaap and core cash measures follows 
securitization under gaap  certain securitization transactions are accounted for as sales of assets 
under core cash  we present all securitization transactions as long term non recourse financings 
the upfront gains on sale from securitization transactions as well as ongoing servicing and securitization revenue presented in accordance with gaap are excluded from the core cash measures and replaced by the interest income  provision for loan losses  and interest expense as they are earned or incurred on the securitization loans 
we also exclude transactions with our off balance sheet trusts which would be considered intercompany on a managed basis 
the following table summarizes core cash securitization adjustments for the years ended december   and years ended december  core cash securitization adjustments net interest income on securitized loans  after provisions for losses gains on student loan securitizations servicing and securitization revenue intercompany transactions with off balance sheet trusts total core cash securitization adjustments derivative accounting core cash measures exclude the periodic unrealized gains and losses caused primarily by the one sided mark to market derivative valuations prescribed by sfas no 
and recognize the economic effect of these hedges  which results in any cash paid or received being recognized ratably as an expense or revenue over the hedged item s life 
we also exclude the gain or loss on equity forward contracts that are required to be accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
as derivatives and are marked to market through earnings 
sfas no 
requires that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria  as specified by sfas no 
 are met 
we believe that our derivatives are effective economic hedges  and as such  are a critical element of our interest rate risk management strategy 
however  some of our derivatives  primarily floor income contracts  certain eurodollar futures contracts  certain basis swaps and equity forward contracts discussed in detail below  do not qualify for hedge treatment as defined by sfas no 
 and the stand alone derivative must be marked to market in the income statement with no consideration for the corresponding change in fair value of the hedged item 
the derivative market value adjustment is primarily caused by interest rate volatility  changing credit spreads and change in our stock prices during the period and the volume and term of derivatives not receiving hedge treatment 
core cash measures exclude the periodic unrealized gains and losses primarily caused by the one sided derivative valuations  and recognize the economic effect of these hedges  which results in any cash paid or received being recognized ratably as an expense or revenue over the hedged item s life 
our floor income contracts are written options which must meet more stringent requirements than other hedging relationships to achieve hedge effectiveness under sfas no 
specifically  our floor income contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment because the paydown of principal of the student loans underlying the floor income embedded in those student loans does not exactly match the change in the notional amount of our written floor income contracts 
under sfas no 
 the upfront payment is deemed a liability and changes in fair value are recorded through income throughout the life of the contract 
the change in the value of floor income contracts is caused by changing interest rates that cause the amount of floor income earned on the underlying student loans and transferred to the counterparties to vary 
this is economically offset by the change in value of the student loan portfolio earning floor income but that offsetting change in value is not recognized under sfas no 
we believe the floor income contracts are economic hedges because they effectively fix the amount of floor income earned over the contract period  thus eliminating the timing and uncertainty that changes in interest rates can have on floor income for that period 
prior to sfas no 
 we accounted for floor income contracts as hedges and amortized the upfront cash compensation ratably over the lives of the contracts 
basis swaps are used to convert the floating rate debt from one interest rate index to another to better match the interest rate characteristics of the assets financed by that debt 
we primarily use basis swaps to change the index of our fixed rate and libor based debt to better match the cash flows of our student loan assets that are primarily indexed to a commercial paper  prime or treasury bill index 
sfas no 
requires that the change in the cash flows of the hedge effectively offset both the change in the cash flows of the asset and the change in the cash flows of the liability 
our basis swaps hedge variable interest rate risk  however they do not meet this effectiveness test because student loans can earn at either a variable or a fixed interest rate depending on market interest rates 
we also have basis swaps that do not meet the sfas no 
effectiveness test that economically hedge off balance sheet instruments 
as a result  these swaps are recorded at fair value with subsequent changes in value reflected in the income statement 
generally  a decrease in current interest rates and the respective forward interest rate curves results in an unrealized loss related to our written floor income contracts 
we will experience unrealized gains losses related to our basis swaps  if the two underlying indices and related forward curve do not move in parallel 
under sfas no 
 equity forward contracts that allow a net settlement option either in cash or the company s stock are required to be accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
as derivatives 
as a result  we account for our equity forward contracts as derivatives in accordance with sfas no 
and mark them to market through earnings 
they do not qualify as effective sfas no 
hedges as a requirement to achieve hedge accounting is the hedged item must impact net income  and the settlement of these contracts through the purchase of our own stock does not impact net income

we employ derivatives  primarily floor income contracts and futures  to economically hedge floor income 
as discussed above under derivative accounting  these derivatives do not qualify as effective accounting hedges and therefore are marked to market through the derivative market value adjustment with no offsetting mark of the economically hedged items 
for core cash measures  we reverse the fair value adjustments on the floor income contracts and futures economically hedging floor income and include the amortization of net premiums received net of eurodollar futures contracts realized gains or losses in income

liquidity and capital resources our dmo and corporate and other business segments are not capital intensive businesses and as such only an immaterial amount of debt and equity capital is included in these segments 
therefore  the following liquidity and capital resource discussion is concentrated on our lending business segment 
we depend on the debt capital markets to support our business plan 
we have developed deep and diverse funding sources to ensure continued access to funding now that the gse has been dissolved 
our biggest funding challenge going forward is to maintain cost effective liquidity to fund the growth in the managed portfolio of student loans as well as to refinance previously securitized loans when borrowers choose to refinance their loans through a consolidation loan with the company 
at the same time  we must maintain earnings spreads and control interest rate risk to preserve earnings growth 
our main source of funding is student loan securitizations and in  we securitized billion in student loans in thirteen transactions including the amount funded through our asset backed commercial paper program transaction versus billion in sixteen transactions in our securitizations backed by ffelp loans are unique securities in the asset backed class as they are backed by student loans with an explicit guarantee on percent of principal and interest 
this guarantee is subject to service compliance 
as evidenced by the and volume  we have built a highly liquid and deep market for student loan securitizations by broadening our investor base worldwide 
securitizations now comprise percent of our financing  versus percent at december  in addition to securitizations  we also significantly increased and diversified our sources of funds through the issuance of billion in slm corporation term  unsecured debt in in and  we strategically introduced several new slm corporation long term issuances to further diversify our funding sources and substantially increased our fixed income investor base 
in total  at december   on balance sheet debt  exclusive of on balance sheet securitizations and on balance sheet secured indentured trusts  totaled billion versus billion at december  without the gse  stand alone liquidity at slm corporation is very important to enable us to effectively fund our student loan acquisitions and operations 
our main sources of liquidity include our billion unsecured revolving credit facility  cash and short term investments  a billion revolving asset backed commercial paper program and our portfolio of readily securitizable student loans  particularly the government guaranteed portion of the portfolio 
in addition to liquidity  a major objective when financing our business is to minimize interest rate risk through match funding of our assets and liabilities 
generally  on a pooled basis to the extent practicable  we match the interest rate and reset characteristics of our managed assets and liabilities 
in this process we use derivative financial instruments extensively to reduce our interest rate and foreign currency exposure 
this interest rate risk management helps us to achieve a stable student loan spread irrespective of the interest rate environment

by using a two step transaction with a qualifying special purpose entity qspe that legally isolates the transferred assets from the company  even in the event of bankruptcy 
the holders of the beneficial interests issued by the qspe are not constrained from pledging or exchanging their interests and we do not maintain effective control over the transferred assets 
in all of our off balance sheet securitizations  we retain the right to receive the cash flows from the securitized student loans in excess of cash flows required to pay interest and principal on the bonds issued by the trust and servicing and administration fees 
prior to  all of our securitization structures were off balance sheet transactions 
in certain and consolidation loan securitization structures  we hold rights that can affect the remarketing of the bonds  such that these trusts did not qualify as qspes and as a result were required to be accounted for on balance sheet as variable interest entities vies 
these securitization structures were developed to broaden and diversify the investor base for consolidation loan securitizations by allowing us to issue bonds with non amortizing  fixed rate and foreign currency denominated tranches 
as of december   we had billion of securitized student loans in on balance sheet securitization trusts 
these securitizations are included as financings in the table below 
in off balance sheet securitizations that qualify as sales  we recognize a gain on the sale  which is calculated as the difference between the allocated cost basis of the assets sold and the relative fair value of the assets received 
the carrying value of the student loan portfolio being securitized includes the applicable accrued interest  unamortized student loan premiums  loan loss reserves and borrower benefits reserves 
the fair value of the residual interest is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology using assumptions discussed in more detail below 
we recognize no gain or loss or servicing and securitization revenue associated with on balance sheet securitizations 
the following table summarizes our securitization activity for the years ended december   and those securitizations listed as sales are off balance sheet transactions and those listed as financings remain on balance sheet

the program is a revolving day multi seller conduit that allows us to borrow up to billion through the sale of student loans subject to annual extensions 
we may purchase student loans out of this trust at our discretion and as a result  the trust does not qualify as a qspe and is accounted for on balance sheet as a vie 
the increase in the private education loan securitization gain percentage in is due to the underlying student loans having higher spreads and the related bonds having a lower funding cost due primarily to the maturing of the private education loan marketplace 
the decrease in the overall gain as a percentage of loans securitized in versus is mainly due to the consolidation loan securitizations not qualifying for off balance sheet treatment 
off balance sheet consolidation loan securitizations generally have higher gains than ffelp securitizations due to higher embedded fixed rate floor income and longer average lives 
the higher gain percentage in versus is due to the higher level of both consolidation loan and private education loan securitizations 
in and  we had record levels of securitization transactions due to funding new student loan purchases  record levels of loan consolidation and the refinancing of gse debt in connection with the wind down 
in  we expect our securitization activity to decline and correlate with the volume of student loan purchases 
long term liquidity risk with the dissolution of the gse  our long term funding  credit spread and liquidity exposure to the corporate and asset backed capital markets has increased significantly 
a major disruption in the fixed income capital markets that limits our ability to raise funds or significantly increases the cost of those funds could have a material impact on our ability to acquire student loans  or on our results of operations 
going forward  securitizations will continue to be the primary source of long term financing 
our securitizations are structured such that we do not provide any level of financial  credit or liquidity support to any of the trusts 
our exposure is limited to the recovery of the retained interest asset on the balance sheet for off balance sheet securitizations 
while all of our retained interests are subject to some prepayment risk  retained interests from our ffelp stafford securitizations have significant prepayment risk primarily from consolidation loans that could materially impair their value 
retained interest in securitized receivables the following table summarizes the fair value of our retained interests along with the underlying student loans that relate to those securitizations that were treated as sales

accounting estimates effect on the residual interest in securitized trusts we updated certain assumptions during that we use in the valuation of the residual interest 
the following are the significant assumption changes that were made as of december  as of december  ffelp stafford loan cpr thereafter thereafter private education loan cpr ffelp expected credit losses as a of securitized loan balance outstanding we increased the ffelp stafford loan cpr assumption to account for the record levels of consolidation loan volume over the past three years 
unless there is a legislative change to the consolidation loan program through hea reauthorization  we believe that high levels of consolidation loan activity will continue 
we decreased the private education loan cpr assumption because these loans are repaying slower than originally projected  including slower prepayments 
we lowered our assumption of expected ffelp credit losses to zero percent to reflect the effect of the ep designation on sallie mae serviced ffelp loans in the trusts 
the ep designation is discussed in more detail in lending business segment student loans allowance for ffelp student loan losses 
servicing and securitization revenue servicing and securitization revenue  the ongoing revenue from securitized loan pools accounted for off balance sheet as qspes  includes the interest earned on the residual interest asset and the revenue we receive for servicing the loans in the securitization trusts 
interest income recognized on the residual interest is based on our anticipated yield determined by estimating future cash flows each quarter

when ffelp stafford loans consolidate  they are a prepayment to the trust and as a result shorten the life of the trust 
we estimate the trust prepayments through consolidation with our cpr assumption 
when consolidation activity is higher than forecasted  the residual interest asset can be impaired and the yield used to recognize subsequent income from the trust is negatively impacted  though we typically retain the value of the asset on balance sheet versus in the trust 
for the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge of million due primarily to a ffelp stafford loans continuing to consolidate at levels faster than projected million and b rising interest rates during the second quarter of  which decreased the value of the embedded floor income component of our retained interest million

our obligation to repurchase shares under equity forward contracts is calculated using the average purchase prices for outstanding contracts in the year the contracts expire 
at or prior to the maturity date of the agreements  we can purchase shares at the contracted amount plus or minus an early break fee  or we can settle the contract on a net basis with either cash or shares 
if our stock price declines to a certain level  the third party with whom we entered into the contract can liquidate the position prior to the maturity date 
off balance sheet lending arrangements the following table summarizes the commitments associated with student loan purchases and contractual amounts related to off balance sheet lending related financial instruments and guarantees at december  year to to over or less years years years total student loan purchases lines of credit letters of credit includes amounts committed at specified dates under forward contracts to purchase student loans and anticipated future requirements to acquire student loans from lending partners discussed below estimated based on future originations at contractually committed rates 
expiration of commitments and guarantees reflect the earlier of call date or maturity date as of december  we have forward purchase commitments to acquire student loans from various lenders  including our largest lending partners  bank one and jpmorgan chase 
with respect to jpmorgan chase  we entered into a joint venture established solely to facilitate our acquisition of student loans originated by jpmorgan chase 
under a renewable multi year agreement  we service and purchase a significant share of bank one s volume 
for further discussion of our relationships with jpmorgan chase and bank one  see business lending business segment sallie mae s lending business in item of this annual report 
we have issued lending related financial instruments including letters of credit and lines of credit to meet the financing needs of our customers 
the contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk should the counterparty draw down the commitment and the counterparty subsequently fails to perform according to the terms of our contract 
most of these commitments and guarantees expire without being drawn 
as a result  the total contractual amount of these instruments is not  in our view  representative of our actual future credit exposure or funding requirements 
to the extent that letters of credit and lines of credit are drawn upon  the balance outstanding is collateralized by student loans 
we earn fees associated with the maintenance of these financial instruments which totaled million  million and million in   and  respectively 
at december   draws on lines of credit were approximately million  which amount is reflected in other loans in the consolidated balance sheet

risks overview managing risks is an essential part of successfully operating a financial services company 
our most prominent risk exposures are operational  market and interest rate  political and regulatory  liquidity  credit  and consolidation loan refinancing risk 
operational risk operational risk can result from regulatory compliance errors  other servicing errors see further discussion below  technology failures  breaches of the internal control system  and the risk of fraud or unauthorized transactions by employees or persons outside the company 
this risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards and contractual commitments  adverse business decisions or their implementation  and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity 
the federal guarantee on our student loans and our designation as an exceptional performer by ed is conditioned on compliance with origination and servicing standards set by ed and guarantor agencies 
a mitigating factor is our ability to cure servicing deficiencies and historically our losses have been small 
should we experience a high rate of servicing deficiencies  the cost of remedial servicing or the eventual losses on the student loans that are not cured could be material 
our servicing and operating processes are highly dependent on our information system infrastructure  and we face the risk of business disruption should there be extended failures of our information systems  any number of which could have a material impact on our business 
we have a number of back up and recovery plans in the event of systems failures 
these plans are tested regularly and monitored constantly 
we manage operational risk through our risk management and internal control processes  which involve each business line including independent cost centers  such as servicing  as well as executive management 
the business lines have direct and primary responsibility and accountability for identifying  controlling  and monitoring operational risk  and each business line manager maintains a system of controls with the objective of providing proper transaction authorization and execution  proper system operations  safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft  and ensuring the reliability of financial and other data 
in  we further strengthened our operational controls by centralizing certain staff functions such as accounting  human resources and legal 
while we believe that we have designed effective methods to minimize operational risks  our operations remain vulnerable to natural disasters  human error  technology and communication system breakdowns and fraud 
market and interest rate risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and or interest rates of our financial instruments 
our primary market risk is from changes in interest rates and interest spreads 
we have an active interest rate risk management program that is designed to reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates and maintain consistent earning spreads in all interest rate environments 
we use derivative instruments extensively to hedge our interest rate exposure  but in our hedging activities is a risk that we are not hedging all potential interest rate exposures or that the hedges do not perform as designed 
we measure interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk 
many assumptions are utilized by management to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income  the more significant of which are related to student loan volumes and pricing  the timing of cash flows from our student loan portfolio  particularly the impact of floor income and the rate of student loan consolidations  basis risk  credit spreads and the maturity of our debt and derivatives 
see also interest rate risk management 
we are also subject to market risk relative to our equity forward contracts that allow us to repurchase our common stock in the future from a third party at the market price at the time of entering the contract 
should the market value of our stock fall below certain predetermined levels  the counterparty to the contract has a right to terminate the contract and settle all or a portion at the original contract price 
we are required to mark our equity forwards to market  so decreases in our stock price could result in material losses 
political regulatory risk because we operate in a federally sponsored loan program  we are subject to political and regulatory risk 
as part of the hea  the student loan program is periodically amended and must be reauthorized every six years 
past changes included reduced loan yields paid to lenders in and  increased fees paid by lenders in  decreased level of the government guaranty in and reduced fees to guarantors and collectors  among others 
the program is scheduled to be reauthorized in and management expects reauthorization to be completed no earlier than in the second half of there can be no assurances that the reauthorization will not result in changes that may have a materially adverse impact to the company 
see other related events and information reauthorization and budget proposals 
the secretary of education oversees and implements the hea and periodically issues regulations and interpretations that may impact our business 
liquidity risk see also liquidity and capital resources securitization activities long term liquidity risk credit risk short term we bear the full risk of borrower and closed school losses experienced in our private education loan portfolio 
these loans are underwritten and priced according to risk  generally determined by a commercially available consumer credit scoring system  fico tm 
additionally  for borrowers who do not meet our lending requirements or who desire more favorable terms  we require credit worthy co borrowers 
when schools close  losses may be incurred when student borrowers have not completed their education 
we have defined underwriting and collection policies  and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all private education loans 
the performance of the private education loan portfolio may be affected by the economy  and a prolonged economic downturn may have an adverse effect on its credit performance 
management believes that it has provided sufficient allowances to cover the losses that may be experienced in both the federally guaranteed and private education loan portfolios over the next to years depending on the portfolio 
there is  however  no guarantee that such allowances are sufficient enough to account for actual losses 
see lending business segment student loans activity in the allowance for private education loan losses 
we have credit risk exposure to the various counterparties with whom we have entered into derivative contracts 
we review the credit standing of these companies 
our credit policies place limits on the amount of exposure we may take with any one party and in most cases  require collateral to secure the position 
the credit risk associated with derivatives is measured based on the replacement cost should the counterparties with contracts in a gain position to the company fail to perform under the terms of the contract 
we also have credit risk with two commercial airlines related to our portfolio of leveraged leases 
see lending business segment losses on securities  net 
consolidation loan refinancing risk the consolidation of our loan portfolio can have detrimental effects 
first  we may lose student loans in our portfolio that are consolidated with other lenders 
in  we experienced a net run off of million of student loans from consolidation loan activity as more of our ffelp stafford student loans were consolidated with other lenders than were consolidated by us 
in  our increased marketing focus on consolidation loans generated a net gain of million  a trend we expect to continue into the future 
second  consolidation loans have lower net yields than the ffelp stafford loans they replace 
this is somewhat offset by the longer average lives of consolidation loans 
third  we must maintain sufficient  short term liquidity to enable us to cost effectively refinance previously securitized ffelp stafford loans as they are consolidated back on to our balance sheet 
ed has taken the position that a borrower may consolidate his or her ffelp consolidation loan with the fdlp irrespective of whether that borrower s ffelp holder offers a consolidation loan with income sensitive repayment terms 
based upon an analysis of the applicable law and regulations  we disagree with ed s interpretations 
if ed s interpretations are formally adopted and not successfully challenged  our managed portfolio could be subject to further consolidation risk 
interest rate risk management asset and liability funding gap the tables below present our assets and liabilities funding arranged by underlying indices as of december  in the following gaap presentation  the funding gap only includes derivatives that qualify as effective sfas no 
hedges those derivatives which are reflected in net interest margin  as opposed to in the derivative market value adjustment 
the difference between the asset and the funding is the funding gap  which represents our exposure to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk  which is the risk that the different indices may reset at different frequencies or may not move in the same direction or at the same magnitude 
management analyzes interest rate risk on a managed basis  which consists of both on balance sheet and off balance sheet assets and liabilities and includes all derivatives that are economically hedging our debt whether they qualify as effective hedges under sfas no 
or not 
accordingly  we are also presenting the asset and liability funding gap on a managed basis in the table that follows the gaap presentation

includes restricted and non restricted cash equivalents and other overnight type instruments 
includes receivables payables  other assets including retained interest  other liabilities and stockholders equity 
the funding gaps in the above table are primarily interest rate mismatches in short term indices between our assets and liabilities 
we address this issue primarily through the use of basis swaps that primarily convert quarterly month libor to other indices that are more correlated to our asset indices 
these basis swaps do not qualify as effective hedges under sfas no 
and as a result are not included in our interest margin and are therefore excluded from the gaap presentation

consists of asset backed commercial paper and auction rate securities  which are discount note type instruments that generally roll over monthly 
includes restricted and non restricted cash equivalents and other overnight type instruments 
includes receivables payables  other assets  other liabilities and stockholders equity 
to the extent possible we generally fund our assets with debt in combination with derivatives that has the same underlying index index type and index reset frequency 
when it is more economical  we also fund our assets with debt that has a different index and or reset frequency than the asset  but only in instances where we believe there is a high degree of correlation between the interest rate movement of the two indices 
for example  we use daily reset month libor to fund a large portion of our daily reset month commercial paper indexed assets 
in addition  we use quarterly reset month libor to fund a portion of our quarterly reset prime rate indexed private education loans 
we also use our monthly non discreet reset funding asset backed commercial paper program and auction rate securities to fund various asset types 
in using different index types and different index reset frequencies to fund our assets  we are exposed to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk  which is the risk that the different indices that may reset at different frequencies will not move in the same direction or at the same magnitude 
we believe that this risk is low as all of these indices are short term with rate movements that are highly correlated over a long period of time 
we use interest rate swaps and other derivatives to achieve our risk management objectives 
when compared with the gaap presentation the managed basis presentation includes all of our off balance sheet assets and funding  and also includes basis swaps that primarily convert quarterly month libor to other indices that are more correlated to our asset indices 
interest rate gap analysis in the table below  the company s variable rate assets and liabilities are categorized by reset date of the underlying index

common stock the following table summarizes our common share repurchases  issuances and equity forward activity for the years ended december  and years ended december  shares in millions common shares repurchased open market equity forwards benefit plans total shares repurchased average purchase price per share common shares issued equity forward contracts outstanding at beginning of year new contracts exercises outstanding at end of year authority remaining at end of year to repurchase or enter into equity forwards includes shares withheld from stock option exercises and vesting of performance stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations and shares tendered by employees to satisfy option exercise costs 
the average purchase price per share for is calculated based on the average strike price of all equity forward contracts including those that were net settled in the cashless transactions discussed below 
the average cash purchase price per share is when a zero cash cost is reflected for those shares acquired in the cashless transactions 
during september and november  we amended substantially all of our outstanding equity forward purchase contracts 
the strike prices on these contracts were adjusted to the then current market share prices of the common stock and the total number of shares under contract was reduced from million shares to million shares and million shares to million shares  respectively 
in addition  as a result of these amendments  we received a total of million shares that settled in september and november free and clear in cashless transactions 
this reduction of million shares covered by the equity forward contracts is shown on a net basis in the exercises row of the table above 
as of december   the expiration dates and purchase prices for outstanding equity forward contracts were as follows contracts in millions of shares outstanding range of average year of maturity contracts purchase prices purchase price the closing price of the company s common stock on december  was 
in october  the board of directors voted to authorize the repurchase of up to an additional million shares of the company s common stock  leaving a remaining authority to enter into additional share repurchases and equity forward contracts for million shares 
in september  the company retired million shares of common stock held in treasury at an average price of per share 
this retirement decreased the balance in treasury stock by billion  with corresponding decreases of million in common stock and billion in retained earnings 
in may  the company s shareholders approved an increase in the number of shares of common stock the company is authorized to issue from million shares to billion shares 
subsequently  the board of directors approved a three for one split of the company s common stock which was effected in the form of a stock dividend on june   for all shareholders of record on june  all share and per share amounts presented have been retroactively restated for the stock split 
stockholders equity has been restated to give retroactive recognition to the stock split for all periods presented by reclassifying from additional paid in capital to common stock the par value of the additional shares issued as a result of the stock split 
student loan marketing association privatization act completion of the gse wind down under the privatization act  the gse was required to wind down its operations and dissolve on or before september  on december   we completed the wind down of the gse by defeasing the remaining debt obligations of the gse and dissolving the gse s federal charter 
specifically  the gse  slm corporation and the federal reserve bank of new york  both in its capacity as trustee and as fiscal agent for the gse s remaining obligations  entered into a master defeasance trust agreement as of december  that established a special and irrevocable trust  which was fully collateralized by direct  noncallable obligations of the united states 
on december   the united states department of the treasury determined that such obligations were sufficient  without consideration of any significant reinvestment of interest  to pay the principal of and the interest on the gse s remaining obligations 
the wind down was completed upon the issuance of that determination and the gse s separate existence terminated 
recent developments proposed pennsylvania higher education assistance authority partnership on december   the company submitted a proposal to the board of directors of the pennsylvania higher education assistance authority pheaa outlining a partnership between the company and pheaa 
under the proposal  the company would purchase pheaa s operations and certain financial assets and would enter into a five year guarantor and loan servicing contract with pheaa 
the company proposed consideration in the form of an upfront payment of million and five annual payments of million each 
the offer was summarily rejected by the pheaa board of directors in december subsequently  the appropriations committee of the pennsylvania state house of representatives held hearings to evaluate the proposal and the student loan marketplace in pennsylvania 
both pheaa and salle mae testified at the hearings 
exceptional performer designation on october   ed formally notified us that sallie mae servicing received the department s exceptional performer designation  a classification awarded to qualified lenders and loan servicers for meeting certain government standards in administering loans under the ffelp 
to qualify as an exceptional performer  lenders and servicers must achieve an overall compliance performance rating of percent or higher for servicing requirements set by ed on federally guaranteed loans 
as a result of the designation  during a one year period that commenced on october   the company will receive percent reimbursement on default claims on federally guaranteed student loans that were serviced by sallie mae servicing for a period of at least days prior to the date of default 
this one year period may be extended on an annual basis so long as the company maintains a satisfactory overall compliance rating 
the initial one year period and any extensions are subject to quarterly compliance audits that can result in the revocation of the designation 
bank one jpmorgan chase relationships on july   following the merger of jpmorgan chase and bank one  the company and bank one entered into a comprehensive agreement under which  among other things we agreed to the termination of our marketing services agreement with bank one  effectively allowing bank one to in source the marketing of its own education loans  bank one paid a million termination fee to the company  we extended our exportss agreement  through which we purchase certain bank one branded ffelp student loans and certain private education loans  from march through august  for a million fee  paid to the company  bank one terminated a separate loan purchase agreement that was entered into with usa group prior to our july acquisition of that entity 
following the termination  we retained the right to purchase ffelp loans originated under this agreement for the academic year and all serial loans and all loans that we originate and service on our servicing platforms on behalf of bank one will be committed for sale under the exportss agreement after the academic year 
in  the last full year of the marketing services agreement with bank one  we earned approximately million in marketing service fees  of which million was recognized in other income and million was capitalized as a reduction in loan purchase premiums 
in connection with the fees  we incurred and recognized million in expenses related to these activities 
we believe we can offset this lost income under the terminated marketing services agreement  as well as an expected gradual reduction in loan purchase volume from bank one  with increased private education loans and ffelp loan originations through our more profitable internal brands 
jpmorgan chase joint venture our separate joint venture with jpmorgan chase currently remains in place  although jpmorgan chase has rejected our initial offer to renew the agreements that support the joint venture and has filed a petition in a delaware chancery court seeking to dissolve the joint venture 
under terms of the joint venture  if the company and jpmorgan chase are unable to mutually agree upon the terms of a new loan purchase and servicing agreement for the five year period beginning september by may   then either party may trigger a dutch auction process 
under that process  the electing party offers to purchase the other party s percent interest or sell its percent interest in the joint venture at a specified price 
the non electing party then has the right to either sell its interest in the joint venture or purchase the electing party s interest  in either case at the originally offered price 
if we are the successful purchaser in a dutch auction  then for a two year period following the closing jpmorgan chase may not compete with the company in the marketing  purchasing  servicing or ownership of education loans except with respect to the continuation of business activities under the bank one name or the name of any other jpmorgan chase affiliate  we may use certain jpmorgan chase trademarks for a nominal annual fee  and we acquire all rights to make additional ffelp student loans serial loans to customers of the joint venture who entered into master promissory notes prior to the dutch auction 
if jpmorgan chase is the successful purchaser in a dutch auction  then for a two year period following the closing it may use certain sallie mae trademarks for a nominal annual fee  we would be required to act as origination and servicing agent for jpmorgan chase at market rates  and we would be required to provide jpmorgan chase with access to certain sallie mae products and services 
if neither party triggers the dutch auction process  then the loan purchase agreement under which the joint venture sells student loans to sallie mae will expire on august  and the joint venture will expire in absent any negotiated settlement or other income  jpmorgan chase and sallie mae would share equally in the economics of the joint venture from september  until the expiration of the joint venture 
through its lawsuit  jpmorgan chase is seeking to dissolve the joint venture without having to follow the mutually agreed upon dutch auction process 
jpmorgan chase s request with the chancery court for an expedited schedule for a final hearing on the merits has been stayed pending settlement discussions among the parties

other related events and information reauthorization and budget proposals congress reauthorizes the hea every five years 
the hea was originally scheduled to expire on september   but by its terms was automatically extended to september  last year  congress passed legislation extending the act to september  we expect that congress will pass a reauthorization bill no earlier than the second half of on february   rep 
john boehner  chairman of the us house of representatives  committee on education and the workforce  reintroduced hr which was reintroduced on february  as hr to correct a technical drafting error  legislation to reauthorize the hea 
this proposal is identical to chairman boehner s reauthorization proposal from its provisions include requiring lenders to return to the federal government floor income in excess of basis points per loan  gradually reducing origination fees to one percent on student loans in both the ffelp and fdlp programs  increasing loan limits for first year and second year students from  to  and from  to  respectively  without increasing the aggregate undergraduate borrowing limits  increasing graduate unsubsidized annual borrowing limits from  to  preserving the current variable interest rate formula on stafford and unsubsidized stafford loans beyond july   changing the current fixed consolidation loan interest rates to variable rates  repealing the single holder rule under the existing rule  if a borrower has multiple student loans that are held by a single lender  a new lender cannot make a consolidation loan unless the single holder declines to offer the borrower a consolidation loan or unless the single holder declines to offer to the borrower a consolidation loan with income sensitive repayment terms  requiring student loan lenders to report to all national credit bureaus  and repealing the percent sap rate payable on certain student loans funded with tax exempt bonds 
on february   president bush released his administration s proposed budget for federal fiscal year the proposed budget contains a number of reauthorization proposals that track hr  including loan limit increases  a change to a variable rate formula for borrower interest rates on the stafford and consolidation loans  partial repeal of the percent sap rates and repeal of the single holder rule 
however  the administration also proposes to reduce the amount of loan principal and accrued interest insured against default from to percent for new loans originated after the effective date of the legislation 
industry participants  like sallie mae  that have been designated by ed as exceptional performers would have their reinsurance reduced from percent to percent under the proposals  although the secretary of education would have the authority under the proposal to set reinsurance at percent for exceptional performers who meet certain criteria 
the administration s budget proposal would also impose a basis point annual loan holder fee on the outstanding balance of non consolidation loans for loans originated on or after july  this proposal is intended to offset the floor income that ffelp lenders may realize in certain declining interest rate environments 
most significantly  the administration proposes to allow borrowers to reconsolidate on multiple occasions subject to a one percent borrower origination fee on reconsolidation and increase the current one time lender fee on new consolidation loans from basis points to one percent 
in addition  the administration proposes to reduce incrementally through the amount guaranty agencies may retain from collections on defaulted loans from percent to percent 
the proposed budget would also reduce  for new loans  the reinsurance provided by ed to guaranty agencies from percent to percent 
finally  the administration proposes to eliminate the perkins loan program 
to date  no reauthorization proposals have been introduced in the senate 
consistent with prior reauthorizations  we expect that there will be competing proposals in both houses of congress to reform federal financial aid programs  including the ffelp 
while we expect the administration s budget proposals will undergo significant review by congress  it is unclear whether they will be introduced as part of the upcoming reauthorization or in other legislation 
if certain proposals were adopted  including the basis point fee and the reconsolidation proposals  the company s financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected and the refinancing risk in its managed consolidation loan portfolio would increase significantly 
legislative update taxpayer teacher protection act of on october  president bush signed the taxpayer teacher protection act of the october act  a new law that amends the hea 
the october act restricts the situations in which lenders are entitled to a minimum yield of percent in connection with loans made from the proceeds of certain tax exempt bonds 
specifically  ed will no longer guarantee a minimum yield of percent for a loan financed with qualifying tax exempt bonds if the underlying bond matures  is retired  is defeased or is refunded or if the loan is refinanced with funds obtained from certain bonds or is sold or transferred to another holder 
the october act  which is effective for a month period  is expected to be permanently extended as part of the reauthorization of the hea 
management expects that the october act will have no impact on the company s earnings or operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity analysis the effect of short term movements in interest rates on our results of operations and financial position has been limited through our interest rate risk management 
the following tables summarize the effect on earnings for the years ended december  and and the effect on fair values at december  and  based upon a sensitivity analysis performed by management assuming a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of basis points and basis points while funding spreads remain constant 
we have chosen to illustrate the effects of a hypothetical increase to interest rates  as an increase gives rise to a larger absolute value change to the financial statements 
year ended december  year ended december  interest rates interest rates change from change from change from change from increase of increase of increase of increase of basis basis basis basis points points points points dollars in millions  except per share amounts effect on earnings increase decrease in pre tax net income before unrealized derivative market value adjustment unrealized derivative market value adjustment increase in net income before taxes increase in diluted earnings per share at december  interest rates change from change from increase of increase of basis points basis points fair dollars in millions value effect on fair values assets student loans other earning assets other assets total assets liabilities interest bearing liabilities other liabilities total liabilities at december  interest rates change from change from increase of increase of basis points basis points dollars in millions fair value effect on fair values assets student loans other earning assets other assets total assets liabilities interest bearing liabilities other liabilities total liabilities a primary objective in our funding is to minimize our sensitivity to changing interest rates by generally funding our floating rate student loan portfolio with floating rate debt 
however  as discussed under lending business segment student loans floor income  in the current low interest rate environment  we can have a fixed versus floating mismatch in funding if the student loan earns at the fixed borrower rate and the funding remains floating 
during the year ended december  and  certain ffelp student loans were earning floor income and we locked in a portion of that floor income through the use of futures and floor income contracts 
the result of these hedging transactions was to convert a portion of the fixed rate nature of student loans to variable rate  and to fix the relative spread between the student loan asset rate and the variable rate liability 
in the above table under the scenario where interest rates increase and basis points  the increase in pre tax net income before the unrealized derivative market value adjustment for is primarily due to the impact of i our off balance sheet hedged consolidation loan securitizations and the related embedded floor income recognized as part of the gain on sale  which results in no change in the embedded floor income as a result of the increase in rates but does result in a decrease in payments on the written floor contracts and ii our unhedged on balance sheet loans not currently having significant floor income due to the recent increase in interest rates  which results in these loans being more variable rate in nature 
the decrease in pre tax net income in before the unrealized derivative market value adjustment reflects lower floor income on the unhedged portion of our student loan portfolio 
under the scenario where interest rates increase basis points  the change in pre tax net income before the unrealized derivative market value adjustment is not proportional to the change under the scenario where interest rates increase basis points because of the additional spread earned on loans hedged with futures and swaps mentioned above and the greater proportion of loans earning at a floating rate under a basis point increase in rates
