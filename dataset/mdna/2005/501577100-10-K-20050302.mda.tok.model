executive summary company description 
we are a global medical device company specializing in the design  manufacture and marketing of medical devices used to treat and restore spinal anatomy using minimally invasive technology 
our devices are presently used primarily by spine specialists including orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons  interventional radiologists  and interventional neuroradiologists who repair compression fractures of the spine caused by osteoporosis  trauma  cancer or benign lesions through minimally invasive spine surgeries known as kyphoplasty procedures 
our commercial products consist of our kyphx instruments used to treat spine fractures during kyphoplasty  including our proprietary kyphx balloon technology and our proprietary brands of bone filler materials 
surgeons use these instruments and bone filler materials to help repair fractures during kyphoplasty procedures 
most alternative spine fracture treatments are either highly invasive or are only pain management therapies 
our corporate headquarters and us operations are located in sunnyvale  california  where we conduct our manufacturing  warehousing  research  regulatory and administrative activities 
outside the us  we operate sales  clinical  regulatory and administrative facilities in brussels  belgium  research and biomaterial manufacturing facilities in rosbach  germany  a clinical  regulatory and administrative facility in japan  and we have direct selling operations in most of the major countries in europe and in canada 
our global distribution network consists of a direct sales force in excess of individuals who market our products in the us  most of the major countries in europe  canada and japan and distributors and sales agents in other countries in which we do not have a direct sales force 
we moved our us headquarters at the end of the first quarter of to our present location from our prior location which was also in sunnyvale  california 
the move of our manufacturing facility was completed during the second quarter of effective august   arthur t 
taylor assumed the role as our vice president  chief financial officer and treasurer 
mr 
taylor most recently was chief financial officer for terayon communication systems  inc of santa clara  california 
effective october   louis j 
lavigne  jr  executive vice president and chief financial officer of genentech  inc  was appointed to our board of directors as chairman of the audit committee and a member of the board s nominating and corporate governance committee 
in the fourth quarter of  we adjusted the responsibilities of some of our executive team to better serve our needs 
bert vandervelde took over responsibility for all of our activities outside of the us  as vice president and general manager  international 
elizabeth a 
rothwell  vice president  operations  assumed responsibility for our research and development activities  to permit avram a 
edidin to focus on external development opportunities as vice president  emerging technologies 
bradley w 
paddock  employed by us for over five years in various sales capacities and intimately familiar with our sales strategies and objectives  assumed the position of vice president  us sales  following the resignation of anthony j 
recupero to pursue other business opportunities  effective december  mr 
recupero remains a consultant to kyphon through june we may make further adjustments to the responsibilities and reporting structure of our executive team as we continue to grow 
products and significant business trends 
our net sales consist of the sales of our kyphx instruments including our kyphx inflatable bone tamps  kyphx inflation syringe  kyphx bone access systems  kyphx bone filler device  kyphx curettes and kyphx bone biopsy device  as well as our recently cleared kyphx hv r bone cement and our ce marked kyphos calcium phosphate from our acquisition of sanatis 
during  our business experienced significant growth 
net sales in increased to million  compared to million in  representing growth of 
we trained approximately  physicians to use our products during in the united states and europe 
in the us  we added over new hospitals to our customer base during that same period 
we continued a program whereby additional spine education specialists were hired with a primary role of educating referring primary care physicians and other medical advisors on kyphoplasty as an alternative to conventional spine fracture treatment and conservative pain management therapies 
in april  we received k clearance from the fda to market our kyphx hv r bone cement for the fixation of osteoporosis related pathological fractures of the vertebral body during kyphoplasty 
in july  we received fda clearance to expand the indications for use for our bone cement to also include fixation of pathological fractures due to cancer or benign lesions during kyphoplasty  as well as specific clearance of our kyphx inflatable bone tamps for fracture reduction or void creation during kyphoplasty 
these clearances allow us to promote numerous short and long term benefits associated with kyphoplasty procedures 
recently  we concluded an extensive review of the published clinical literature describing the results for patients treated with kyphoplasty and  patients treated with vertebroplasty 
the data in the published literature demonstrates that kyphoplasty is associated with a statistically significantly lower procedure related complication rate  and a statistically significantly lower procedure related bone cement complication rate  as compared to vertebroplasty 
as a result  we have now introduced the corresponding comparative claims into our educational and marketing materials 
in april  we filed two patent infringement suits against disc o tech  an israel based company doing business in the united states 
we filed suit in the united states district court in delaware and in the itc in washington  dc in september  the itc entered an order barring disc o tech from all further importation of its sky bone expander device into the united states and from engaging in any further sales activities and uses of such imported products  which thereby terminated the itc proceeding in our favor 
an enforcement proceeding against disc o tech in the itc may later be initiated if it is determined that disc o tech is not complying fully with the itc order 
in delaware  our complaint presently alleges  among other things  that by importing  manufacturing  distributing and promoting its sky bone expander device and related tools for use in kyphoplasty procedures  disc o tech is willfully infringing five of our us patents  all of which generally concern the use of various medical devices to repair spinal compression fractures  and seeks enhanced damages and a permanent injunction for its willful infringement 
trial is set for june we are using the information discovered during the itc proceeding about disc o tech s business activities to prosecute our case against disc o tech in delaware and will continue to do so vigorously 
costs related to this litigation will be dilutive to our earnings 
in addition to disc o tech  several other companies either have already introduced one or more products into the us and or foreign markets to compete with our kyphx instruments for treating vertebral fractures or may be on the verge of doing so 
to the extent any competing products infringe our patents  we will consider how best to protect our market space as well as whether to take action against any potentially infringing activities 
as a result  we may decide that litigation or other legal activity to seek to protect and enforce our rights  in addition to our ongoing actions against disc o tech  would be appropriate 
regardless of if we do so  however  we likely will have to compete with these competitive products for some period of time and may ultimately not succeed in enforcing our rights 
we may not have the ability to prevent those products from remaining on the market in at least some geographic locations  and we may lose market share or have our growth impeded as a result 
we have had several recent encouraging developments related to reimbursement for our products 
first  in may  the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms icd coordination and maintenance committee issued and published a recommendation for a specific icd cm in patient procedure code for the kyphoplasty procedure 
on august   this rule was approved and the kyphoplasty procedure was assigned icd cm code to go into effect on october  this code was assigned to the following five diagnosis related group drg codes    and drg codes establish the payment levels that hospitals can claim reimbursement from medicare and medicaid and are in turn  key factors in determining reimbursement levels and ultimately the quantity of products used in procedures such as kyphoplasty 
at this time it is not yet clear how each of these codes will be applied  especially  and  which are new 
we anticipate increased clarification as more information becomes available from cms in the next few months 
second  in november  cms published the final rule on the medical hospital outpatient prospective system and created new and distinct hospital outpatient procedure codes for kyphoplasty  c and c these new c codes are assigned to apc and are effective january  at the reimbursement level presently in effect  we do not anticipate that many kyphoplasty procedures will be performed on an outpatient basis 
on a national level  the healthcare common procedure coding system hcpcs national editorial panel established two new hcpcs s codes for kyphoplasty effective january  these s codes are intended for use by private payors  such as the blue cross blue shield association and the health insurance association of america  although no payment level is associated with these codes 
in addition  policy and or bulletin coverage is now established in states  with the remaining states providing coverage on a case by case basis 
the private payor community has also shown significant interest in establishing reimbursement policies for kyphoplasty 
specifically  blue cross blue shield has now adopted policy coverage for kyphoplasty in states  and a number of private payors nationwide have also adopted policy coverage 
however  there are some private payors that may continue to perceive the procedure which uses our products as experimental and thus not subject to reimbursement 
another challenge we face is to achieve consistent and or increased payment levels among the different insurers 
we continue to focus on addressing these issues 
there was also progress in surgeon reimbursement during presently  no national cpt code exists for spine specialist reimbursement under medicare for performing kyphoplasty  and a cpt code may not exist for some time 
physicians presently must report procedures using our instruments under an unlisted cpt code 
in the fourth quarter of  the ama cpt editorial panel considered multiple applications for a national cpt code for spine specialist reimbursement for kyphoplasty  which is the initial step in the cpt process 
we have learned that the ama cpt editorial panel has decided to support the establishment of a national cpt code for kyphoplasty 
we also understand that the relative value survey process involving input from the medical community regarding the kyphoplasty procedure may begin in the first or second quarter of we understand that upon conclusion of the survey process and determination of the appropriate reimbursement level  the results may be publicly communicated in the fourth quarter of in the federal register 
despite these developments  we cannot be certain that a cpt code for kyphoplasty with an associated value ultimately will become effective in or at all 
while we perceive this ama cpt editorial panel support for the establishment of a national cpt code for kyphoplasty to be significant progress  we cannot be certain what action will ultimately taken  or how any action taken may affect our marketplace or our business  or whether any cpt code ultimately would increase or decrease any of the spine specialist reimbursement already available 
any cpt code has at least the potential to be detrimental to spine specialist reimbursement  and thus to our revenues 
in europe  kyphoplasty was assigned a code in the newly implemented german ops system 
in other european countries  we continue to focus efforts on obtaining reimbursement coverage for the procedure  although no assurances can be provided that such efforts will result in favorable outcomes for us 
we are aware that one or more competitors is attempting to adversely affect our ability to acquire timely and appropriate levels of reimbursement in several foreign countries by seeking much lower levels of reimbursement for their own competitive products that may not support the pricing or anticipated pricing for our products in those markets 
we do not know whether these efforts will continue  be effective or broad in application 
notwithstanding these activities  we will continue to seek appropriate levels of reimbursement in those markets using appropriate measures 
we frequently evaluate potential opportunities for growth in our business by evaluating external products and technologies 
while our primary focus will remain on our core business and the large opportunities the osteoporosis  cancer and trauma vertebral fracture markets present  we may choose to pursue one or more business development opportunities which we believe are appropriate initiatives for our business  even if outside of the field for the treatment of spinal fractures or outside of the spine itself 
some of the opportunities we are presently investigating include technologies and products that address degenerative disc disease and various cancers associated with our core market 
these efforts may require us to seek additional funding and may be dilutive to our earnings 
significant industry factors 
our industry is impacted by numerous competitive  regulatory and other significant factors 
the growth of our business relies on our ability to continue to develop new products and innovative technologies  obtain regulatory clearance and compliance for our products  protect the proprietary technology of our products and our manufacturing processes  manufacture our products cost effectively  and successfully market and distribute our products in a profitable manner 
we  and the entire industry  are subject to extensive government regulation  primarily by the fda 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 
additionally  our industry is highly competitive and our success depends on our ability to compete successfully against our competitors 
we devote significant resources to assessing and analyzing competitive  regulatory and economic risks and opportunities 
a detailed discussion of these and other factors is provided in the factors affecting future operating results section of our md a 
results of operations changes to previously announced fiscal fourth quarter and annual results on february   we announced our fiscal fourth quarter and annual results 
on february   the sec issued additional guidance regarding accounting for incentives associated with operating leases 
in light of this guidance  we concluded that reflecting an additional million in long term liabilities and a corresponding million of additional property and equipment was appropriate 
this adjustment related to a reimbursement received from our lessor in in conjunction with the lease of our headquarters in sunnyvale  california 
in conjunction with this lease  we received cash incentives from our landlord to be used for leasehold improvements 
these amounts have now been reflected as additional deferred rent and additional property and equipment and are being amortized to rent expense and depreciation expense over the term of our operating lease  respectively 
there was no change to our fiscal fourth quarter and annual net income or earnings per share as previously announced 
comparison of years ended december   and the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our results of operations expressed as dollar amounts in thousands and as percentages of net sales year ended december  of of of amount net sales amo unt net sales amount net sales us net sales  international net sales  net sales  cost of goods sold  gross profit  operating expenses research and development  sales and marketing  general and administrative  purchased in process research and development total operating expenses  income loss from operations  other and interest income expense  net  net income loss before income taxes  provision benefit for income taxes  net income loss  net sales 
net sales increased million  or  in compared to  and increased million  or  in compared to the increases in net sales primarily resulted from an increase in the number of physicians trained in the use of our kyphx instruments as well as an increase in the number of procedures performed by trained physicians 
in addition  net sales increased due to the introduction of new products and to a much lesser extent selected product price increases 
domestic sales increased million  or in compared to and million  or in compared to international sales increased million  or in compared to and million  or in compared to the increase in international sales also reflected the currency impact of million and million in and  respectively  as the euro exchange rate continued to strengthen against the us dollar 
no customer accounted for more than of total net sales in  or as of december   we had trained approximately  spine specialists in the us and approximately  clinicians in other parts of the world  primarily europe 
these physicians have used our kyphx instruments in over  spine surgeries since we first introduced our products 
we believe the total number of potential physicians who may perform kyphoplasty procedures using our products is approximately  to  in the us the number of physicians in europe is less defined at this time  but we believe them to be more than  we have targeted a range of million to million in net sales for cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold consists of material  labor  subcontract  and overhead costs 
cost of goods sold increased million  or  in compared to  and increased million  or  in compared to however  cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales continued to decrease primarily as a result of fixed overhead costs being spread over increased production volume 
the absolute increase in cost of goods sold over the years from to resulted primarily from increased material  labor  subcontract  overhead costs and inventory provisions in relation to the increased sales volume of our products 
our cost of goods sold and corresponding gross profit percentages can be expected to fluctuate in future periods depending upon changes in our product sales mix and prices  distribution channels and geographies  manufacturing yields  period expenses and levels of production volume 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist of costs for product research  product development  regulatory and clinical functions and personnel 
research and development expenses increased million  or  in compared to research and development expenses increased million  or  in compared to the increase in from was primarily attributable to increased personnel costs of million  increased clinical studies expense of million  increased research and development consulting fees of  and increased facilities costs of  offset by a decrease in amortization of deferred stock based compensation expense of million 
the increase in from was primarily attributable to increased personnel costs of million  increased research and development consulting fees of  increased product testing and development expenditures of  and increased basic and applied research funding of  we expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development and anticipate that research and development expenses in will increase in absolute dollars due largely to the commencement of clinical studies 
as a percentage of targeted net sales  we anticipate our research and development expenses to be in the range of to for sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist of costs for personnel  physician training programs and marketing activities 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  in compared to sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  in compared to the increase in from related primarily to a million increase in the costs of hiring  training and compensating additional direct selling representatives and expansion of the spine education specialist sales force  increased sales travel expenses of million  increased expenditures for surgeon training and professional education of million and increased outside professional service fees and consulting expenses of million 
the increase in from related primarily to a million increase in the costs of hiring  training and compensating additional direct selling representatives  increased expenditures related to advertising  promotion  trade shows and market research activities of million  increased sales travel expenses of million  and increased consulting expenses of million 
as we continue to commercialize our kyphx instruments on a global basis during  we expect to significantly increase our sales and marketing efforts and expenditures in absolute dollars while maintaining our sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of targeted net sales at to for the year 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs  professional service fees  expenses related to intellectual property rights  sarbanes oxley compliance initiatives and general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in compared to general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in compared to the increase in from was primarily attributable to increased personnel costs of million  increased litigation costs of million and increased consulting and outside professional service fees of million 
the increases in expenses were offset partially by decreased amortization of deferred stock based compensation of  the increase in from resulted primarily from increased personnel costs of million  increased facility expenses of  increased licenses and insurance expenditures of  increased travel and entertainment expenses of  and facility expense of million due to an early lease termination as a result of our decision to move to a larger facility 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in the future as we add personnel  continue to expand our patent portfolio and incur additional public reporting  governmental compliance and investor related expenses as a public company 
therefore  we anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we expand our infrastructure 
as a percentage of targeted net sales  we expect that our general and administrative expenses will be approximately to in purchased in process research and development 
we did not purchase additional in process research and development in in february  we purchased sanatis gmbh  for approximately million in cash and acquisition costs of  sanatis is a privately held developer and manufacturer of orthopedic biomaterials based in rosbach  germany 
the acquisition was made to add sanatis experience developing and manufacturing orthopedic biomaterials and to complement our existing patent portfolio with sanatis intellectual property surrounding calcium based biomaterials and delivery technologies 
the impact to our financial operating results during was an increase in research and development of approximately  we have recorded the transaction using the purchase method of accounting 
at the time of this transaction  we recorded an expense associated with the purchase of in process research and development expenses of  and we capitalized net tangible assets of  intangible assets of  and goodwill of million 
we are amortizing the intangible assets on a straight line basis over a five year period 
no amortization of goodwill has been recorded 
instead  we perform an assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test annually  or more frequently  if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggests the remaining value is not recoverable 
the annual goodwill impairment test was completed in the first quarter of fiscal  and it was determined that there was no impairment of goodwill at that time 
in august  we entered into a patent license agreement with bonutti research inc for the rights to a series of patents issued to dr 
peter bonutti and other related patent rights and applications as defined in the agreement 
under the terms of the agreement  we acquired the exclusive right to develop any of the claimed inventions  including expandable balloons and related products  for use within bone  and for use within joints  ligaments  tendons  or cartilage in the spine and the co exclusive right to develop any of the claimed inventions  including expandable balloons and related products  for orthopedic use in treating or diagnosing injuries of the joints  ligaments  cartilage  nerves or tendons outside of the spine 
we paid million in cash for the rights  all of which was immediately expensed to purchased in process research and development 
at the time of the acquisition  the acquisition cost was immediately expensed to operations as it was determined that the technology acquired may be used to develop products that have not been approved for sale by regulatory authorities  and the in process projects to which the patents may apply had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
other and interest income expense  net 
other and interest income expense  net  increased  in compared to other and interest income expense  net  increased million in compared to the increase in compared to resulted primarily from an increase in interest income due to higher cash  cash equivalents and investment balances 
the increase in from resulted from interest income from higher cash  cash equivalent and investment balances resulting from the proceeds of our initial public offering in may as well as decreased interest expense from repaid convertible promissory notes  also in may provision benefit for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes in was million at an effective tax rate of for the year 
the benefit for income taxes of million for resulted primarily from a tax provision offset by the release of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of our deferred tax assets arose from federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  federal and state tax credit carryforwards as well as from other timing differences 
historically  these deferred tax assets had been offset in total by a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of our deferred tax assets 
the release of the valuation allowance and the resulting recognition of a deferred tax benefit in was based on management s belief that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets would be realized 
we believe that in our effective tax rate will be approximately of income before taxes  with the actual amount of taxes paid potentially reduced by the utilization of net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards as well as deductions due to stock option activities 
at december   we had approximately million and million in federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  respectively  to reduce future taxable income 
the federal and state carryforwards have expiration dates beginning in and  respectively  in each case if not utilized 
at december   we had research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively 
if not utilized  the federal research and development tax credit carryforwards will expire beginning in the state research and development tax credit can be carried forward indefinitely 
the tax reform act of limits the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in certain situations where changes occur in the stock ownership of a company 
ownership changes  as defined  occurred on august   december  and may  in accordance with internal revenue code section  utilization of the carryforwards is subject to annual limitation 
the annual limitation is not expected to result in the expiration of net operating losses prior to utilization 
deferred and stock based compensation we recorded deferred stock based compensation for financial reporting purposes as the difference between the exercise price of options granted to employees and the deemed fair value of our common stock at the time of grant 
deferred stock based compensation is amortized to cost of goods sold  research and development expense  sales and marketing expense and general and administrative expense 
deferred stock based compensation recorded through december  was million  with accumulated amortization of million 
the remaining million will be amortized over the remaining vesting periods of the options 
the options are generally subject to a four year total vesting schedule from the date of grant 
all deferred stock based compensation amounts are being amortized using a straight line method 
we expect to record amortization expense for deferred stock based compensation as follows year amount million million stock based compensation expense related to stock options granted to non employees is recognized as the stock options are earned 
the stock based compensation expense will fluctuate as the fair market value of our common stock fluctuates 
in connection with the grant of stock options to non employees  we recorded stock based compensation expense of approximately  million and million in  and  respectively 
seasonality our business is seasonal in nature 
historically  demand for our products has been the highest in the first and second quarters in the us and in the second and fourth quarters in europe 
in the us  during the fourth quarter  our net sales generally reflect the reduced number of selling days due to the holiday season 
in europe  we traditionally experience somewhat lower sales volumes in the third quarter months than throughout the rest of the year as a result of the european summer holiday schedule 
in addition  the fourth quarter in europe is typically favorably impacted by our customers budget utilization and our distributors fulfillment of their annual purchase commitments 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  million of investments short and long term  and working capital of million 
our cash and cash equivalents increased during the year ended december  by million over the corresponding amount of cash and cash equivalents as of december  cash provided by operating activities 
our operating cash flow in was primarily the result of our operational profitability 
net cash provided by operations was approximately million in attributable primarily to net income of million and adjustments for non cash charges related to the amortization of deferred stock based compensation of million  changes in deferred tax assets of million and tax benefits from stock options of million 
accrued liabilities increased by million due to our increased operating expenses and deferred rent and other increased by million 
this was partially offset by increases in inventory balances of million and increases in accounts receivable of million as we increased our net sales 
net cash provided by operations in was approximately million primarily attributable to net income of million and adjustments for non cash charges related to the amortization of deferred stock based compensation of million  increases in accrued liabilities of million and accounts payable of million as we accrued for income taxes and increased our operating expenses offset partially by the release of the valuation allowance of the deferred tax asset of million and increases in inventory balances of million and increases in accounts receivable of million as we increased our net sales 
our net cash flow from operations in reflected a near balance of operational cash inflow versus growing working capital needs 
net cash provided by operating activities was  in attributable primarily to the add back of million write off of in process research and development charge  non cash charges related to million amortization of deferred stock based compensation  and million of non cash interest expense offset partially by net loss of million  and increases in accounts receivable and inventories due to increased sales 
cash used in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash used in investing activities reflected purchases of property and equipment for all periods 
during  cash used in investing activities reflected the net purchases of investments of million 
during  cash used in investing activities reflected the net purchases of investments of million  and payment of million in connection with the sanatis acquisition 
during  cash used for investing activities reflected the purchases of investments of million and payment of million in connection with the patent sublicense agreement 
cash provided by financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash provided during was attributable to proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan of million and the exercise of stock options of million 
cash provided during was attributable to proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan of million  exercise of stock options of million and repayment of related party notes receivable of million 
cash provided during was attributable primarily from proceeds of million from issuing common stock in our initial public offering partially offset by repayment of convertible promissory notes of million 
contractual cash obligations 
at december  we had contractual cash obligations as follows in thousands payment due by perio ds total after operating leases    asset retirement obligation total commitments    the amounts reflected in the table above for operating leases represent aggregate future minimum lease payments and asset retirement obligations under noncancellable facility leases 
portions of these payments are denominated in foreign currencies and were translated in the tables above based on their respective us dollar exchange rates at december  these future payments are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
although we also entered into contracts for outsourced services  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
stock repurchase 
our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program on november  pursuant to which up to  shares of our outstanding common stock may be repurchased 
the duration of the repurchase program is open ended 
under the program  we may purchase shares of common stock through open market transactions at prices deemed appropriate by management and the board of directors 
the purchases will be funded from available working capital 
in  we repurchased  shares pursuant to this repurchase program 
we did not repurchase any of our common stock during or summary 
we believe our current cash  cash equivalents  investments  and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
if existing cash  cash equivalents  and cash generated from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  or for other reasons related to our business  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights senior to those associated with our common stock  and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
any additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts 
we expect to increase capital expenditures consistent with our anticipated growth in manufacturing  infrastructure and personnel as well as revisions and upgrades to our new facility 
we also may increase our capital expenditures as we expand our product lines or invest in new markets 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment revised  sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r would require companies to measure all stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in the consolidated financial statements  including grants of employee stock options 
in addition  the adoption of sfas no 
r will require additional accounting related to the income tax effects and additional disclosure regarding the cash flow effects resulting from share based payment arrangements 
sfas no 
r is effective for public companies for interim and annual periods beginning after june  adoption of sfas no 
r  which is effective as of july   will have a material adverse impact on our earnings 
critical accounting policies and estimates all of our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
however  certain of our more critical accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
different  reasonable estimates could have been used in the current period 
additionally  changes in accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
both of these factors could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition  or results of operations 
we believe that the following financial policies and estimates are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require subjective or complex judgments 
further  we believe that the items discussed below are properly recorded in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
management has discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of our most critical financial estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and our independent registered public accounting firm 
the judgments about those financial estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
those financial policies and estimates include revenue recognition 
our revenue is derived primarily from the sale of our products to customers and distributors 
revenue is considered to be realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time of shipment when the risk of loss and title passes to the customer or distributor 
allowances are established for product returns and discounts based upon historical trends and are recorded as a reduction to revenue 
accounts receivable allowances 
we estimate allowances for doubtful accounts and for product returns 
specifically  we make estimates on the collectibility of customer accounts and sales returns and allowances based primarily on analysis of historical trends and experience and changes in customers financial condition 
management uses its best judgment  based on the best available facts and circumstances  and records a reserve against the amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount that is expected to be collected 
these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved 
our accounts receivable allowances have been less than of net sales for each of the years ended december   and our accounts receivable balance was million and million  net of allowances of million and  at december  and  respectively 
excess and obsolete inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of the cost principally standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our industry is characterized by regular new product development that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand due to cannibalization of existing products 
also  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may be required to increase the provision needed for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if additional inventory write downs are required  we would recognize additional cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
regardless of changes in our estimates of future product demand  we do not increase the value of our inventory above its adjusted cost basis 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  significant unanticipated decreases in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
our reserve for excess and obsolete inventories was  and  at december  and  respectively 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
the tax consequences of most events recognized in the current year s financial statements are included in determining income taxes currently payable 
however  because tax laws and financial accounting standards differ in their recognition and measurement of assets  liabilities  equity  revenue  expenses  gains and losses  differences arise between the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income for a year and between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
because it is assumed that the reported amounts of assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled  respectively  a difference between the tax basis of an asset or a liability and its reported amount in the balance sheet will result in a taxable or a deductible amount in some future years when the related liabilities are settled or the reported amounts of the assets are recovered  hence giving rise to a deferred tax asset or liability 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
as of december   we had provided a full valuation allowance of million against our deferred tax assets  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward  before they expire 
in the fourth quarter of  we released our valuation allowance because based upon our recurring level of profitability  we believed that it was more likely than not that we would be able to utilize our deferred tax assets before they expire 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences that may result in deferred tax assets 
management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
any such valuation allowance would be based on management estimates of taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets would be recoverable 
as of december  and  we have recorded no valuation allowance  based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize our deferred tax assets before they expire 
purchase accounting 
purchase accounting requires extensive accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price between in process research and development  other identifiable intangible assets  tangible assets  and goodwill as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
purchased in process research and development is defined as the value assigned to those projects for which the related products have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use 
determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to in process research and development and other intangible assets requires us to make significant estimates 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to purchased in process research and development and other intangible assets is determined by estimating the future cash flows of each project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods 
for purchased in process research and development  these methodologies include consideration of the risk of the project not achieving commercial feasibility 
impairment of long lived assets 
we account for the impairment of long lived assets in accordance sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or in the case of goodwill  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets and goodwill whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable or at least on an annual basis for goodwill 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant decline in our market value or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
the annual goodwill impairment test was completed in the first quarter of fiscal  and it was determined that there was no impairment of goodwill at that time 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of estimated future cash flows  including profit margins  long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  groupings of assets  discount rates and terminal growth rates 
in addition  significant estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of the fair value of our tangible long lived assets  including replacement cost  economic obsolescence  and the value that could be realized in orderly liquidation 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our long lived assets  thereby requiring us to write down the assets 
factors affecting future operating results if domestic and international payors adversely change third party coverage and reimbursement policies for kyphoplasty procedures  or if reimbursement for kyphoplasty procedures becomes difficult to obtain or is not available in sufficient amounts  our ability to market and sell our kyphx instruments would be adversely impacted  which would harm our business and our future growth 
our success is dependent upon the availability of adequate reimbursement within prevailing health care payment systems in the united states and abroad  for physicians and hospitals for their services when they perform kyphoplasty procedures using our kyphx instruments 
medicare currently provides reimbursement at varying payment levels when kyphoplasty is performed using our kyphx instruments in all states and in the district of columbia 
in a small number of cases  physicians performing a procedure using our instruments have not been reimbursed  either adequately or at all 
in addition  some physicians in some states believe that the level of reimbursement they receive is too low 
reimbursement for competing procedures  such as vertebroplasty  may also continue to be perceived in some cases as more favorable for the physician or hospital than that available for using our products and thus may reduce the frequency with which kyphoplasty procedures using our products are performed 
medicare  as well as private health maintenance organizations and insurance plans  may institute adverse changes in payors policies toward reimbursement of kyphoplasty procedures 
medicare and private insurance payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling health care costs through limitation on reimbursable procedures and the exploration of more cost effective methods of delivering health care 
new limits on coverage and reimbursement of hospitals and other health care providers may significantly impact the willingness of hospitals  clinics and doctors to purchase and use our kyphx instruments 
reimbursement and health care payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country and include both government sponsored health care and private insurance 
in addition  health care cost containment efforts similar to those we face in the united states are prevalent in many of the other countries in which we intend to sell our instruments  and these efforts are expected to continue in both the united states and abroad 
future adverse changes in insurance coverage and reimbursement policies in the united states or other nations would impact our ability to market and sell our kyphx instruments  harm our business and reduce our revenues 
currently  medicare reimburses physicians who use our kyphx instruments on a state by state basis 
this form of reimbursement is not uniform across all states because there is presently no national cpt code or associated national payment rate relating to kyphoplasty procedures using our instruments 
in the fourth quarter of  the ama cpt editorial panel considered multiple applications for a national cpt code for spine specialist reimbursement for kyphoplasty  which is the initial step in the cpt process 
we have learned that the ama cpt editorial panel has decided to support the establishment of a national cpt code for kyphoplasty 
we also understand that the relative value survey process involving input from the medical community regarding the kyphoplasty procedure may begin in the first or second quarter of we understand that upon conclusion of the survey process and determination of the appropriate reimbursement level  the results may be publicly communicated in the fourth quarter of in the federal register 
despite these developments  we cannot be certain that a cpt code for kyphoplasty with an associated value ultimately will become effective in or at all 
we also cannot assure you that establishment of a national cpt code  if any  would not adversely affect our business since the reimbursement level associated with the national cpt code could be less than what physicians in some states are presently receiving and thus could make surgery with our products less attractive  which would harm our revenues 
continued adoption of our kyphx instruments by the medical community may be adversely impacted if physicians perceive they do not receive sufficient reimbursement from payors for their services in performing the procedures using our instruments 
if physicians or hospitals are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement for procedures in which our kyphx instruments are used  we may be unable to sell our instruments and our business could suffer 
our future success depends on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new products  product extensions and improvements to existing products to address unmet patient and market needs 
our current products offer orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons  interventional radiologists  and interventional neuroradiologists the ability treat and restore spinal anatomy during kyphoplasty 
we cannot assure you that the market for the treatment of spine fractures will continue to generate significant of consistent demand for our kyphx instruments 
demand for our products could be significantly diminished by alternative treatment methods  and by new technologies or products that replace and render our products obsolete or too expensive 
our future success is dependent upon  among other factors  our ability to develop  obtain regulatory approval of  manufacture and market new products 
we must successfully sell and achieve market acceptance of new products  product extensions and enhanced versions of existing products 
the extent of  and rate at which  market acceptance and penetration are achieved by future products  is a function of many variables 
these variables include price  safety  efficacy  reliability  marketing and sales efforts  the availability of third party reimbursement of procedures using our new products  the existence of competing products and general economic conditions affecting purchasing patterns 
our ability to market and sell new products  product extensions and enhanced versions of existing products may also be subject to government regulation  including clearance approval by the united states food and drug administration  or fda  and foreign government agencies 
any failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products  product extensions or enhanced versions of existing products and achieve market acceptance of new products and product extensions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and our business 
because we may face significant competition from other companies with greater resources or superior technology than we have  we may be unable to maintain our competitive position and sales of our instruments may decline 
the market for medical devices is intensely competitive  subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
while the direct competition we have faced to date has been limited  we are aware that several companies  some with more resources than ours  are developing and already introducing products to directly compete with ours in similar procedures  both in the united states and abroad 
some of these competitors products may be successful in our market as a result of greater efficacy  less expensive alternatives to our products  or some other advantage that makes their products more attractive than ours  which could significantly impact our reimbursement levels  anticipated revenues and future growth 
our industry also includes large pharmaceutical companies that are developing drug products that may reduce the incidence of osteoporosis and cancer and  therefore  the market for our instruments 
our ability to compete successfully depends in part on our ability to respond quickly to medical and technological changes and user preferences through the development and introduction of new products that are of high quality and that address patient and surgeon requirements 
we compete with many larger companies that enjoy several competitive advantages  including longer standing distribution networks  and relationships with health care providers and payors  additional lines of products  and the ability to bundle products to offer higher discounts or other incentives to gain a competitive advantage  and greater resources for product development  sales and marketing and patent litigation 
at any time  other companies may develop additional competitive products 
if we are unable to compete effectively against existing or future competitors  sales of our instruments will decline 
if we are unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property  our ability to compete in the market will be harmed 
we believe that the proprietary technology embodied in our instruments and methods gives us a competitive advantage 
maintaining this competitive advantage is important to our future success 
we rely on patent protection in the us and abroad  as well as on a combination of copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  to protect our proprietary technology 
however  these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage 
for example  our patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented by third parties 
our two earliest patents  which we believe provide broad protection to our technology but which are presently in litigation and so far untested  expire no later than february our patent applications may not issue as patents at all or in a form that will be advantageous to us 
we may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by consultants  vendors  former employees and current employees  despite the existence of nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other contractual restrictions 
furthermore  the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and may permit others to copy our products abroad without effective recourse 
if our intellectual property rights are not adequately protected or enforced  we may be unable to keep other companies from competing directly with us  which could result in a decrease in our market share 
to protect our rights  we may in the future initiate other claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights  in order to protect our rights or further determine the scope and validity of our intellectual property protection 
we may also begin one or more patent proceedings in various administrative agencies  such as the world s various patent offices  to protect our patent rights and prevent them from being undermined by our competitors patent filings 
if we decide to enforce our intellectual property rights to prevent or inhibit appropriation of our technology by competitors  that process will be expensive and time consuming to litigate or otherwise dispose of  will divert management s attention from our core business  and may harm our business if we do not prevail 
we have initiated patent infringement litigation against disc o tech medical technologies ltd 
that will be costly to us and may hurt our competitive position if we do not prevail 
in april  we filed two patent infringement suits against disc o tech 
one has been resolved in our favor  one remains pending 
while we believe our allegations have merit  we cannot assure you that we will prevail in our suits against disc o tech 
regardless of whether we prevail  these suits will be costly to us and will divert management s attention and resources away from our business 
if we do not prevail  some or all of our asserted proprietary rights may be damaged or invalidated  which may harm our valuation and our ability to protect our business from competition 
in addition  our stock price may decline as a result of the impact of the litigation  including the financial impact of the cost of the litigation  public announcements of intermediate results  the inability or unwillingness of the company to discuss its internal litigation strategies publicly  and rulings on various motions  and or the public s perception of the litigations progression 
our instruments could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  which may lead to costly litigation  payment of substantial damages or royalties and or our inability to use essential technologies 
the medical device industry has been characterized by extensive litigation and administrative proceedings regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
whether an instrument infringes a patent involves complex legal and factual issues  the determination of which is often uncertain 
our competitors may assert that our instruments and methods infringe their patents 
from time to time  we receive correspondence from various third parties accusing us of infringing their patents or inviting us to license their patents 
in addition  they may claim that their patents have priority over ours because they invented first or their patents were filed or issued first 
because patent applications can take many years to issue  there may be applications now pending of which we may be aware or unaware  which may later result in issued patents that our instruments or methods may infringe 
there could also be existing patents that one or more of our instruments or methods may inadvertently be infringing 
as the number of competitors in the market for minimally invasive spine disorder treatments grow  the possibility of a patent infringement claim against us increases 
infringement and other intellectual property claims  with or without merit  against us can be expensive and time consuming to litigate or otherwise dispose of and can divert management s attention from our core business 
in addition  if we lose an intellectual property litigation matter  a court could require us to pay substantial damages and or royalties and or issue a preliminary or permanent injunction that would prohibit us from making  using and selling essential technologies unless we could design around the patents  which we may be unable to do 
also  although we may seek to obtain a license under a third party s intellectual property rights to bring an end to any claims or actions asserted or threatened against us or to address an injunction or simply if we believe it makes business sense to do so  we may not be able to obtain a license on reasonable terms or at all 
if we cannot design around a patent  are enjoined from infringing it  and cannot obtain a satisfactory license  we may be forced to cease selling our products  which would do substantial harm to our business 
if primary care physicians are unwilling or unable to refer a larger number of patients to trained clinicians that use our products to perform kyphoplasty  our revenues will suffer and our business may not expand or may decline 
a key element of our business strategy is to educate primary care physicians and spine specialists on the use of our kyphx instruments as an alternative to conventional spine fracture treatment and conservative pain management therapies 
in  we initiated a pilot program whereby selected sales representatives call on primary care physicians to educate them about our products 
we believe that primary care physicians and spine specialists may not widely adopt our products unless they determine  based on experience  clinical data and published  peer reviewed journal articles  that our products provide benefits or an attractive alternative to conventional treatments of spine fractures 
in addition  we believe that recommendations and support of our products by influential practitioners are essential for market acceptance and adoption of our products 
if we are unable to convince a significant number of primary care physicians and spine specialists to accept and use our products  then our ability to commercialize our kyphx instruments will be negatively affected  our future growth will be harmed and our business may decline 
our failure to maintain necessary regulatory clearances or approvals  or to obtain additional regulatory clearances or approvals  could hurt our ability to commercially distribute and market our kyphx instruments 
our kyphx instruments and bone cement  and our kyphos calcium phosphate  are considered medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the united states and in foreign countries where we currently conduct  or intend to do business 
unless an exemption applies  each medical device that we wish to market in the united states must first receive either k clearance or premarket approval from the fda 
the fda s k clearance process usually takes from three to months  but may take longer 
the premarket approval process generally takes from one to three years from the time the application is filed with the fda  but it can take longer and be significantly more expensive than the k clearance process 
so far  we have obtained k clearance for the kyphx inflatable bone tamps for fracture reduction or void creation in specific sites including the spine including for use during kyphoplasty using our bone cement  hand  tibia  radius and calcaneus  and clearance for our kyphx hv r bone cement for the treatment of pathological fractures of the vertebral body due to osteoporosis  cancer  or benign lesions during kyphoplasty procedures 
these clearances allow us to promote numerous short and long term clinical benefits associated with kyphoplasty procedures 
nevertheless  our k clearances can be revoked if safety or effectiveness problems develop 
we also will be required to obtain k clearance or premarket approval to market additional products  such as new biomaterials for use in kyphoplasty  which will likely require clinical data  and to market our existing products for new indications  such as treatment of fractures caused by trauma 
if the clinical data gathered are not supportive  then applications will not be filed 
if we choose to seek additional clearances or approvals by filing one or more applications  we cannot be certain that we would obtain any further k clearances or premarket approvals in a timely manner or at all  and delays in obtaining clearances or approvals may adversely affect our revenue growth and future profitability 
if regulatory authorities abroad do not modify or retract their prior pronouncements concerning the use of bone cement in the spine or if they issue new pronouncements  our ability to promote and sell our instruments in those geographies may be harmed 
in july  the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency mhra of the united kingdom issued a medical device alert entitled  injectable polymeric cements in percutaneous vertebroplasty  kyphoplasty and pedicle screw augmentation procedures 
the united kingdom mhra has received reports of bone cement leaking during vertebroplasty and pedicle screw augmentation procedures leading to patient complications 
the alert noted that there have been no complications reported to mhra from kyphoplasty procedures  but stated that it was including kyphoplasty procedures in the alert due to similarities the mhra perceived exist between kyphoplasty procedures and the other procedures it identified in its alert 
we believe the mhra s alert concerning kyphoplasty pertains directly to our kyphx products  since our products are the only balloons presently available in europe to perform kyphoplasty 
the notification asks physicians to consider alternatives before performing procedures using bone cement in the spine  to use the manufacturer s instructions in preparing bone cements for use in the spine  and to take specific precautions before and during those procedures 
so far  despite the fda s april clearance of our bone cement and other cements for use in kyphoplasty procedures in the united states and the fda s subsequent modification of its own web notification concerning the use of bone cement in the spine to acknowledge its clearance of our bone cement  the mhra has declined to update its own notification 
if the mhra notification is not modified or retracted in light of the fda s clearance of our proprietary kyphx hv r bone cement for specific use in the spine  then the notification may raise concerns with our customers  potential customers and reimbursement organizations  which could negatively impact our ability to sell and promote our instruments in geographic markets that follow mhra s guidance 
in addition  an increase in reports of deaths or serious injuries could lead the fda or foreign regulatory agencies to issue safety alerts  health advisories  or mandated labeling changes restricting use of our instruments  including new warnings regarding their use or contraindicating their use with bone cement  which could also harm our business and cause our revenues to decline 
modifications to our marketed devices may require new k clearances or premarket approvals or the fda may require us to cease marketing or recall the modified devices until clearances are obtained 
any modification to a k cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness  or that would constitute a major change in its intended use  requires a new k clearance or  possibly  premarket approval 
the fda requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance  but the fda can review any manufacturer s decision 
we have modified aspects of our kyphx instruments without seeking new k clearances because we believe that the modifications do not significantly affect the product s safety or effectiveness 
the fda may not agree with any of our decisions not to seek new clearances or approvals 
if the fda requires us to seek k clearance or premarket approval for any of these modifications to a previously cleared device  we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified device until we obtain clearance or approval  and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties 
if we are unable to expand our manufacturing capacity in a timely manner  or if we do not accurately project demand  we will have excess capacity or insufficient capacity  either of which could adversely affect our operating results 
we currently manufacture substantially all of our kyphx instruments in our facilities located in sunnyvale  california 
we plan to devote significant resources to expand our manufacturing capacity at this facility 
we could experience difficulties and disruptions in the manufacture of our kyphx instruments 
we could also face the inability to procure and install the necessary manufacturing equipment  a shortage of components we use in our products  a lack of availability of qualified manufacturing personnel to work in our sunnyvale facility  difficulties in achieving consistent quality control from new manufacturing lines and an inability to maintain sufficient manufacturing capacity 
we may experience delays  disruptions  capacity constraints and other problems in our manufacturing operations  and  as a result  product shipments to our customers could be delayed  which would negatively impact our revenues  competitive position and reputation 
if we are unable to expand our manufacturing capacity in a timely manner  or if we do not accurately project demand  we will have excess capacity or insufficient capacity  either of which could seriously harm our profitability 
because injuries that occur during spine surgery can be significant  we are subject to an increased risk of product liability lawsuits 
if we are sued in a product liability action  we could be forced to pay substantial damages 
we manufacture medical devices that are used on patients in spine surgery procedures 
spine surgery  including kyphoplasty  involves risk of serious complications  including cardiac arrest  cerebrovascular accident  myocardial infarction  pulmonary embolism  and death 
use of bone filler material by surgeons to fill the void created using our kyphx inflatable bone tamp may also lead to these complications  as a result of leakage of the bone filler material into the spinal canal or surrounding tissue or for other reasons 
we are aware that some of these complications have occurred during procedures performed with our products  including our kyphx hv r bone cement and kyphos calcium phosphate  and we have had to publicly report that information through filing a medical device report to the fda or vigilance reports in europe 
increased reporting of adverse events in connection with the use of our or other bone void filler materials during kyphoplasty could expose us to increased risk of product liability litigation  and our current insurance coverage limits may not be adequate 
companies  including ours  which produce devices for use in the spine  are subject to a significant risk of product liability litigation 
if any of our devices are found to have caused or contributed to any injury  we could be held liable for substantial damages  and our current product liability coverage limits may not be adequate to protect us from any liabilities we might incur 
in addition  we may require increased product liability coverage if sales of our devices increase 
product liability insurance is expensive and may not be available to us in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
our non us sales present special risks 
sales outside of the united states account for a significant percentage of our revenues and we intend to continue to expand our presence in international markets 
non us sales are subject to a number of special risks 
for example our products may sell at lower prices outside the united states  agreements may be difficult to enforce  receivables may be difficult to collect through a foreign country s legal system  foreign customers may have longer payment cycles  foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign income  impose tariffs or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade  us export licenses may be difficult to obtain  intellectual property may be more difficult to acquire and enforce in foreign countries  and copying of our products in certain jurisdictions may become widespread  terrorist activity may interrupt distribution channels or impact our customers or employees  and fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and adversely affect the profitability  in us dollars  of products sold in foreign markets where payments are made in local currencies 
any of these events could harm our foreign operations 
our reliance on suppliers could limit our ability to meet demand for our products in a timely manner or within our budget 
we are dependent upon outside suppliers to provide us with key components necessary for the manufacture of our products 
in addition  we are presently sourcing our kyphx inflation syringe and our kyphx hv r bone cement from single suppliers  without any present viable alternative suppliers qualified 
generally  since we obtain components through purchase orders rather than long term supply agreements and do not maintain large volumes of inventory  a product recall  disruption or termination of the supply of components could adversely affect our continued ability to conduct business  including causing a significant increase in manufacturing costs associated with the need to obtain replacement components  our inability to meet demand for our instruments  which could lead to customer dissatisfaction and damage our reputation  and delays associated with regulatory qualifications required for use of replacement suppliers 
any one of these results could harm our sales and profits and make it difficult to meet our business goals 
if we do not effectively manage our growth  our existing infrastructure may become strained  and as a result we may be unable to increase sales of our kyphx instruments or generate significant revenue growth 
our world wide direct sales organization has increased from approximately employees in october to over employees in december  which we believe represents very significant growth over a relatively short period of time 
our world wide organization as a whole has increased from approximately employees in october to over employees in december we intend to continue to grow rapidly 
the growth that we have experienced  and in the future likely will experience  provides challenges to our organization  requiring us to rapidly expand our personnel and manufacturing operations 
we may not be able to hire sufficient personnel to meet our growth goals or may have difficulty managing such rapid growth 
as a result  our failure to recruit additional sales and other personnel may result in our inability to meet our projections 
future growth may strain our infrastructure  operations  product development and other managerial and operating resources 
if our business resources become strained  we may not be able to deliver instruments in a timely manner 
we are dependent on our senior management team and key personnel  and the loss of any of them could harm our business 
our continued success depends in part upon the continued availability and contributions of our senior management team and key personnel 
we have entered into an employment agreement with richard w 
mott  but this agreement does not guarantee his service for any specified period of time 
we have not entered into employment agreements with any of our other senior management or key personnel 
the loss of members of our senior management or key personnel  or our inability attract and retain other qualified personnel or advisors could have a material adverse effect on or results of operations and financial condition 
since we depend upon distributors in some markets  if we lose a distributor or a distributor fails to perform  our revenues will be harmed in those geographic markets 
with the present exception of the larger countries in europe and in canada  we sell our kyphx instruments in foreign markets through distributors and sales agents 
to the extent we rely on distributors  our success will depend upon the efforts of others  over which we may have little control 
we recently terminated our relationship with distributors in mexico and korea and are in the process of establishing new relationships in those geographic regions 
we may also terminate or modify other distribution relationships in further geographic locations in the future 
if we lose a distributor or a distributor fails to perform  our revenues will be harmed in those geographies  and the market for our products may also be harmed in those geographies as a result of the distributor s or agent s actions 
we may be adversely affected by the impact of environmental and safety regulations 
we are subject to federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and occupational health and safety  including laws regulating the disposal of hazardous wastes and the health and safety of our employees 
we may be required to obtain permits for governmental authorities for certain operations 
if we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations  we could incur fines  penalties or other sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
we could incur material expenses in the future realting to compliance with future environmental laws 
in addition  we could be held responsible for costs and damages arising from any contamination at our present facilities or third party waste disposal sites 
such costs could be material 
we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials  and we may incur material liability as a result of any contamination or injury 
if we choose to make acquisitions or divestitures  we could encounter difficulties that harm our business 
we may acquire companies  products or technologies that we believe to be complementary to our present or future direction of our business 
we do not know if we will be able to successfully complete any future acquisitions 
if we do so  we may have difficulty integrating the acquired personnel  financials  operations  products or technologies 
acquisitions may dilute our earnings per share  disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses  which could harm our business 
that our principal stockholders have significant voting power and stock ownership may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders 
our officers  directors and principal stockholders together control approximately of our outstanding common stock as of february  if these stockholders act together  they will be able to control our management and affairs in all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
this concentration of ownership may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders 
in addition  our other stockholders may not perceive that one or more actions taken by this concentrated group of stockholders is in our or the remaining stockholders best interests  which could harm our valuation and our stock price may decline 
our certificate of incorporation and by laws include anti takeover provisions that may enable our management to resist an unwelcome takeover attempt by a third party 
our basic corporate documents and delaware law contain provisions that enable our management to attempt to resist a takeover unless it is deemed by management and our board of directors to be in the best interests of our stockholders 
those provisions might discourage  delay or prevent a change in the control of our company or a change in our management 
our board of directors may also choose to adopt further anti takeover measures without stockholder approval 
the existence and adoption of these provisions could adversely affect the voting power of holders of common stock and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities and corporate governance laws and regulations will increase our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of that became law in july  as well as new rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the sec and the nasdaq exchange on which we are listed  have required changes to some of our corporate governance practices 
the act also requires the sec to promulgate additional new rules on a variety of subjects 
we expect all of these new rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs  to make some activities more difficult  time consuming and or costly  and to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  all of which may affect our financial performance 
these new rules and regulations may also make it more difficult for us to attract or retain qualified executive officers and members of our board of directors  particularly to serve on our audit committee 
we can provide no assurance regarding our  or our independent auditor s  conclusions after december  with respect to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to include an internal control report from management in our annual report on form k for the years ending on and after december  the internal control report must include a statement about management s responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting  identifying the framework used by management to conduct the required evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  concerning management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the period covered by the annual report  including a statement as to whether or not internal control over financial reporting is effective  and that our independent auditors have issued an attestation report on management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting 
while we are expending significant resources in developing the necessary documentation and testing procedures required by section  given the risks inherent in the design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting  we can provide no assurance as to our  or our independent auditor s  conclusions after december  with respect to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
if we are unable to comply with all of the requirements imposed by section  or if we are unable to complete any assessment of our internal controls  or if our internal controls are not designed or operating effectively  our external auditors may either disclaim an opinion as it relates to management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control or may issue a qualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls 
investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and which could affect our business and financial condition 
recent changes in the required accounting treatment for stock options will have a material negative impact on our financial statements and may affect our stock price 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
r  pursuant to which we must measure all stock based compensation awards  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value method and record such expense in our consolidated financial statements 
this requirement to expense stock based compensation awards is set to take effect for public companies for interim and annual periods beginning after june  currently  kyphon discloses such expenses on a pro forma basis in the notes to our annual financial statements  but does not record a charge for employee stock option expense in the reported financial statements 
once kyphon begins to comply with sfas no 
r as of the beginning of the third quarter of  our reported earnings will decrease  which may affect our stock price 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to interest rate risk at december  is related primarily to our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio includes fixed rate debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers 
a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of our investments to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing rate rises  the fair value of the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  investments are generally held to maturity and the weighted average duration of our investments is months or less 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
we have operated mainly in the united states  and   and of our sales were made in us dollars in   and  respectively 
the majority of our european sales are derived from european union countries and denominated in the euro 
monthly income and expense from our european operations are translated using average rates and balance sheets are translated using month end rates 
differences are recorded within stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or to the statement of operations  as applicable
