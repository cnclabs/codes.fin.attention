item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this filing 
overview business environment virage logic corporation provides semiconductor intellectual property semiconductor ip platforms comprising memories  logic and i os input output interface components 
these various forms of ip are utilized by our customers to design and manufacture system on chip soc integrated circuits that power today s consumer  communications  internet infrastructure  handheld and portable devices  computer and graphics applications 
our customers include fabless semiconductor companies  integrated device manufacturers and foundries 
as semiconductor companies face increasing pressures to bring products to market faster and semiconductors have shorter product cycles  we focus on providing our customers a broad product offering as a means to satisfy a larger portion of our customers semiconductor ip needs  while positioning ourselves to offer advanced products as the semiconductor industry migrates to smaller geometries 
the timing of customer purchases of our products is typically related to new design starts by fabless companies and migration to new manufacturing processes by idms and foundries 
because of the high costs involved in new design starts and migration to new manufacturing processes  our customers decision regarding these matters is heavily dependent on their long term business outlook 
as a result  our business  and specifically our license revenues  is likely to grow at times of positive outlook for the semiconductor industry 
while in fiscal we saw signs of a moderate recovery in the semiconductor industry  our customers were cautious in their long term business outlook during fiscal in fiscal  we derived of license revenue from the more advanced processes  micron  nm and nm technologies  and from the older process nodes  predominantly  and micron technologies 
the company expects the micron  nm and nm technologies to drive revenue growth in the foreseeable future while license revenues from the older process nodes decline 
the company s royalty revenue to date has been from production on the older process nodes  and we expect future growth in royalty revenues to be driven by the advanced processes  micron  nm and nm technologies  in addition to continued production on the micron technology 
we sell our product early in the design process  and there are time delays of to months between the sale of our products and the time we expect to receive royalty revenues 
these time delays are due to the 
table of contents length of time required for our customers to implement our semiconductor ip into their designs  and then to manufacture  market and sell a product incorporating our products 
as a result  we expect our royalty revenues to increase in periods in which manufacturing volumes of semiconductors are growing 
future growth of our royalty revenue is dependent on our ability to increase the number of designs incorporating our products and on such designs achieving substantial manufacturing volumes 
sources of revenues our revenues are derived principally from licenses of our semiconductor ip products  which include semiconductor ip platforms  embedded memory  logic and i o elements  standard and custom memory compilers  memory test processor and fuse box components for embedded test and repair of defective memory cells 
we also derive revenues from royalties  custom design services  maintenance services and library development and consulting services related to the license of logic components 
our revenues are reported in two separate categories license revenues and royalty revenues 
license revenues are derived from license fees  maintenance fees  fees for custom design services  library design services and consulting services 
royalty revenues are derived from fees paid by a customer or a third party foundry based on production volumes of wafers containing chips utilizing our semiconductor ip technologies 
the license of our semiconductor ip typically covers a range of platform  embedded memory  logic and i o products 
licenses of our semiconductor ip products can be either perpetual or term based 
in addition  maintenance can be purchased for both types of licenses 
we derive our royalty revenues from third party foundries that manufacture chips incorporating our area  speed and power asap memory products for our fabless customers  and from integrated device manufacturers and fabless customers that utilize our star memory system tm and novea technologies 
royalty payments are in addition to the license fees we collect from our customers  and are calculated based on production volumes of wafers containing chips utilizing our semiconductor ip technologies based on a rate per chip or rate per wafer depending on the terms of the respective license agreement 
royalty revenues are generally determined and recognized one quarter in arrears  when a production volume report is received from the customer or foundry 
currently  license fees represent a significant portion of our revenues  although over the last few years royalties have represented an increased percentage of our revenues 
royalty revenues for the years ended september    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
we have been dependent on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our annual revenues  although that dependency continues to decrease 
customers comprising our top customer group have changed from time to time 
in each of fiscal   and  no single customer generated more than of our revenues  although one customer  tsmc  generated of our fiscal revenues 
sales to customers located outside north america accounted for  and of our revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
substantially all of our direct sales representatives and field application engineers are located in north america and europe and serve those regions 
in japan and the rest of asia  we use both indirect sales through distributors and direct sales through sales representatives 
all revenues to date have been denominated in us dollars 
significant events in fiscal our royalty revenues continued to increase  growing from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year mainly as a result of a significant increase in manufacturing volumes by foundries in asia  particularly of micron technology where we have a broad product offering 

table of contents we continue to create and build relationships with emerging foundries and have entered into agreements with dongbuanam  silterra and smic 
this expands the number of technologies for which we sell our products and has the potential to increase our future royalties from customers that use these foundries 
we introduced the iprima mobile tm ultra low power memories as the first offering in our iprima family of application optimized semiconductor ip platforms designed to address the unique requirements for such markets as consumer  communications and networking  computer and graphics  and portable and handheld and as part of our strategy of offering our customers advanced products that address the costs  yield and technical challenges of smaller geometries 
during fiscal we signed a total of agreements for our nanometer product offerings  direct royalty bearing agreements for the star memory system  direct royalty bearing agreements for the novea non volatile embedded memory product and received orders from new customers 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that we make estimates and judgments  which affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continually evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies such as litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following as critical accounting policies to our company revenue recognition valuation of accounts receivable valuation of long lived assets and investments valuation of purchased intangibles  including goodwill accounting for stock options income taxes 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is based on the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition as amended by statement of position and statement of position additionally  revenue is recognized on some of our products  according to statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenues from perpetual licenses for our semiconductor ip products are generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
if any of these criteria are not met  we defer recognizing the revenue until such time as all criteria are met 
revenues from term based licenses  which are generally twelve months in duration  are recognized ratably over the term of the license  provided the criteria mentioned above are met 
license of custom memory compilers and logic libraries may involve customization to the functionality of the software  therefore revenues from such licenses are recognized in accordance with the provisions of statement of position  over the period that we perform services 
revenues derived from library development services are recognized using a percentage of completion method  and revenues from technical consulting services are recognized as the services are performed 
for all license and service agreements 
table of contents accounted for using the percentage of completion method  we determine progress to completion based on labor hours incurred 
we believe we are able to reasonably and reliably estimate the costs to complete projects accounted for using the percentage of completion method 
alternatively  for customers transactions for which we can not reasonably and reliably estimate the costs to complete a project  the completed contract method of accounting is used  such that costs are deferred until the project is completed at which time revenues are recognized 
a provision for estimated losses on engagements is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
costs incurred in advance of billings are recorded as costs in excess of related billings on uncompleted contracts 
if customer acceptance is required for completion of specified milestones  the related revenue is deferred until the acceptance criteria is met 
for agreements which include multiple elements  we recognize revenues attributable to delivered or completed elements covered by such agreements when such elements are completed or delivered 
the amount of such revenues is determined by deducting the aggregate fair value of the undelivered or uncompleted elements  which we determine by each such element s vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  from the total revenues recognizable under such agreement 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of each element of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing for such licensed product and service when sold separately  and for maintenance  it is generally determined based on the stated renewal rate in each contract 
revenues are recognized once we deliver the element identified as having vendor specific objective evidence or once we complete the provision of the services 
maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the maintenance period  which is generally twelve months 
the company assesses whether the fee associated with each transaction is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured and evaluates the payment terms 
if a portion of the fee is due beyond normal payment terms  the company recognizes the revenue on the payment due date  assuming collection is reasonably assured 
the company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history and the overall credit worthiness of the customer 
if collection is not reasonably assured  revenue is deferred and recognized at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
amounts invoiced to our customers in excess of recognized revenues are recorded as deferred revenues 
the timing and amounts invoiced to customers can vary significantly depending on specific contract terms and can therefore have a significant impact on deferred revenues in any given period 
royalty revenues are generally determined and recognized one quarter in arrears  when a production volume report is received from the customer or foundry  and are calculated based on production volumes of wafers containing chips utilizing our semiconductor ip technologies based on a rate per chip or rate per wafer depending on the terms of the respective license agreement 
while we believe our estimates of hours incurred and the labor rates used in calculating percentage of completion for certain agreements involving customization are reasonable  however  different assumptions could materially affect the timing of our revenue recognition 
valuation of accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust customers credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their then current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection risks that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowance we have established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively small number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the quality of our accounts receivables and our future operating results 

table of contents valuation of long lived assets and investments we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets and investments for continued realizability 
this review is based upon our projections of anticipated future cash flows from such assets and investments 
while we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect our evaluations  which could result in an impairment charge 
valuation of purchased intangibles  including goodwill we periodically evaluate purchased intangibles  including goodwill  for impairment 
an assessment of goodwill is subjective by nature  and significant management judgment is required to forecast future operating results  projected cash flows and current period market capitalization levels 
if our estimates or related assumptions change in the future  these changes in conditions could require material write downs of net intangible assets  including impairment charges for goodwill 
in connection with the acquisition of in chip systems inc  the valuation of intangible assets was based on management s estimates 
such estimates included cash flow projections  discount rates and estimated life of technology  which management believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
use of other estimates or assumptions may have resulted in a different valuation for such intangible assets acquired leading to changes in recorded asset values 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over the estimated life of each asset 
as of september   management believes no impairment of intangible assets has occurred 
accounting for stock options we account for outstanding stock options under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin  and comply with the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
in accordance with apb  we do not recognize compensation expense for options granted to employees as all employee options are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock 
the company accounts for stock options or warrants granted to non employees  excluding non employee directors  under sfas and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments with variable terms that are issued for consideration other than employee services under sfas we record the expense of such services based upon the estimated fair value of the equity instrument using the black scholes pricing model 
assumptions used to value the equity instruments are consistent with equity instruments issued to employees 
we charge the value of the equity instrument to earnings over the term of the service agreement 
at the time all non employee options and warrants were valued  the instruments were immediately exercisable and there were no ongoing obligations from the holders 
there were no stock options grants to non employees  excluding non employee directors  and no expenses recorded in the years ended september  and expenses recorded for stock options granted to non employees for the year ended september  was  we make estimates and assumptions for the inputs used in the fair value calculation 
material differences in amounts of expense may result if different estimates and assumptions are used 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payments sfas no 
r  revising sfas no 
the revision supersedes apb and its related implementation guidance 
sfas no 
r eliminates the alternative use of the intrinsic value method permitted under apb no 
and requires publicly traded companies to measure the cost of equity based awards granted to employees based on the grant date fair value of the award 
sfas no 
r also provides that the costs should be recognized over the period during which the employees services are rendered generally the vesting period 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite services 
sfas no 
r is effective for the company s fiscal year beginning october  the company is currently evaluating the extent of the impact of adopting sfas no 
r 

table of contents income taxes we record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
these differences resulted in deferred tax assets of million at september  although the company has reported losses in two of the three succeeding years  it believes that the carrying value of the net deferred tax assets is appropriate and is based on its estimates and assumptions for the generation of future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
management evaluates the recoverability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the need  if any  for additional valuation allowances 
taxes payable were million and million at september  and  respectively 
results of operations years ended september   and the following table lists the percentage of revenues for certain items in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated year ended september  revenue license royalties cost and expenses cost of revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative stock based compensation total cost and expenses operating income loss interest income interest and other expenses income tax provision benefit net income loss revenues 
total revenues in fiscal  and were as follows fiscal year total revenues million million million revenues increased million in from and million in from the increase in revenue was the result of increases in royalty revenue of million partially offset by a decline in license revenue of million 
the increase in revenue was the result of increases in both license and royalty revenue 

table of contents the following table lists the percentage of license revenues by geometry for the years ended september    and year ended september  by geometry micron technology micron technology nanometer technology nanometer technology other license revenues decreased million in from and increased million in from from a product perspective  nanometer technology license revenue grew million while nanometer technology contributed sales of of total in and in up from in these sales were derived from all categories of our customers idm integrated device manufacturers  fabless and foundry semiconductor customers 
during  the percent of our license revenues derived from micron technology decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal  a drop of million from the decrease in license revenues was primarily due to what we believe are fewer project design starts by fabless semiconductor customers on the micron technology as evidenced by the decrease in sales of the micron technology from to of total license revenues from to royalties increased million from to and million from to the increase was supported by customers using our memory based product family 
the increase was due to increased manufacturing volumes by foundries in asia  particularly of micron technology 
for the years ended september   and  total revenues by geography are as follows year ended september  by geography united states canada japan taiwan europe  middle east and africa emea other total from a geographic perspective  the increase resulted primarily from significant sales increases in taiwan of million  increases of million in the united states and million in other geographic segments  partially offset by declining volumes in europe  middle east and africa of million  japan of million and canada of million 
the increase in license revenue in from primarily resulted from a significant increase in sales outside of north america  which was driven by significant sales growth in global idm accounts  by growth in japan  and by a successful strategy of penetrating top tier and emerging foundries in the pacific rim 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues in fiscal  and were as follows fiscal year cost of revenues million million million 
table of contents cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel expenses  the allocation of facilities  software maintenance licensing fees and equipment expenses 
the increase between and was due primarily to a million increase in labor cost associated with increased headcount  a million increase in third party contractor expenses and a million decrease in hardware and software tools expenses 
the increase between and was due primarily to a million increase in labor cost associated with bonus compensation consistent with our profitable operations as well as increased headcount  and million increase in maintenance license fees for third party software utilized in our product development 
the decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues from to was attributable to improved labor utilization during a period of higher revenues on a year over year basis 
cost of revenues excludes   and  of amortization of stock based compensation for the years ended september   and  respectively 
research and development expense 
research and development expenses in fiscal  and were as follows research and fiscal year development expenses million million million research and development expense increased from to and decreased from to the increase in research and development expense from to was due to an increase of million in software license and maintenance fees  an increase in contractor expenses of million  increases in travel and telecommunications of million and an increase in personnel expenses of million 
this increase was offset by decreases in bonus expense of million and depreciation expense of million 
the decrease in research and development expense from to was due to a decrease in depreciation expense of million and lower personnel and consulting expenses of million  which was the result of shifting personnel to activities associated with the development and delivery of our products  offset by an increase of million in software license and maintenance fees and an increase in travel expense of million 
research and development expense excludes   and  of amortization of stock based compensation for the years ended september   and  respectively 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expenses in fiscal  and were as follows sales and fiscal year marketing expenses million million million sales and marketing expense increased from to and from to the increase in sales and marketing expense in was primarily due to increases of million in labor cost  a million increase in marketing communications  advertising and promotion costs  increases of million in travel costs associated with increased headcount  increases of million in telecommunication costs and million in recruiting expenses offset by a million decrease in commissions for third party sales reps  a million decrease in bonuses for internal sales reps and a million decrease in facilities and it expenses allocated to marketing and sales 
the increase in sales and marketing expense in was primarily due to costs of hiring more senior personnel and related higher compensation expense of million  commensurate with revenue growth and growth in operations  and increase in advertising expense of million  an increase in travel cost of million  an increase in overhead expenses of million  partially offset by a decrease in consulting expenses of million related to market research

general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal  and were as follows general and fiscal year administrative expenses million million million general and administrative expense increased from to and increased from to the increase in general and administrative expense between and was primarily due to additional costs of million related to sarbanes oxley implementation costs  million of increased accounting  audit and outside service fees  the increase in personnel related expense of million  an aggregate increase in it  employee benefits and facilities of million and increased legal fees of million 
these increases were offset by the decrease in business insurance  bonuses  depreciation and facilities expense of million or million each 
the increase in general and administrative expense between and was primarily due to the increase in personnel related expense of million  increased bad debt provision of million  an increase in consulting expense of million  increased rent costs of million  offset by the decrease in legal and accounting fees of million 
general and administrative expense excludes   and  of amortization of stock based compensation for the years ended september   and  respectively 
stock based compensation 
with respect to the grant of stock options and restricted stock to employees  our balance sheet reflects an aggregate deferred stock based compensation of approximately  and  for the years ended september   and this stock based compensation balance for september  resulted from the grant of stock options to employees prior to our initial public offering that were determined to have been granted at an exercise price that was lower than the fair market value of our common stock for accounting purposes and to a lesser extent related to equity instruments acquired in connection with the acquisition of in chip systems  inc in may the amount of deferred stock based compensation is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and is amortized under the multiple option approach  which results in recognizing expense on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the applicable options  generally four years 
amortization  net of cancellations  was million  million and million for the years ended september   and  respectively 
interest income 
interest income was million  million and million for the years ended september     respectively 
interest income increased from to due to the increasing interest rate environment and increased average balance of our investment holdings 
interest and other expenses 
interest and other expenses resulted in a net other expense of  in the year ended september   net other income of  for the year ended september  and net other expense of  for the year ended september  the net other expense in is primarily due to foreign exchange loss on foreign currencies in the amount of  the net other income in primarily includes foreign exchange gain on foreign currencies in the amount of  the net other expense in primarily includes interest expense paid on capital leases of  income tax provision 
for fiscal  we recorded a tax provision benefit of million on a pre tax loss of million  yielding an effective benefit tax rate of 
for fiscal  we recorded a provision of  on a pre tax income of million  yielding an effective tax rate of 
for fiscal  we recorded an income tax benefit of million on a pre tax loss of million  yielding an effective tax rate of 
the effective tax rate differs from the us statutory tax rate primarily due to benefits related to current year research credits  recovery of tax deductions related to stock based compensation programs and other immaterial items 
the change in the effective tax rate from fiscal to is primarily due to the change in the company s pre tax position  research credits and recovery of tax deductions for stock based 
table of contents compensation programs 
the change in the effective tax rate from fiscal to fiscal is primarily the result of the company s pre tax income position after its pre tax loss of million due to lower than expected revenues in fiscal additionally  the company s india branch office has received a tax assessment from the government of india  income tax department  for the tax year claiming the company owes approximately an additional million in income taxes 
the company asserts that the claim is baseless but  in october  has made a deposit of approximately  with the indian tax authorities as required and is appealing the tax assessment with the indian government s commissioner of income tax appeals 
in the event that an unfavorable outcome of the tax appeal process occurs  the company believes it will not have a material impact on our financial position or on our cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources at september   cash  cash equivalents and investments were million compared to million as of september  of that  million was held in cash and cash equivalents  a decrease of million from cash and cash equivalents held at september  primarily as a result of the purchase of short term and marketable fixed income securities 
we held million in investments at september   as compared to million at september  in fiscal  and  operations were funded primarily from cash collections of accounts receivable 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities of million in resulted from a net loss of million in fiscal  adjusted for aggregate non cash charges associated with depreciation and amortization of million and the amortization of stock based compensation of million 
the decrease in accounts receivable of million was due primarily to increased collections of overdue customer receivables 
days sales outstanding for the fiscal fourth quarter of  based on revenues of million and net accounts receivable of million  was days  down from days in the fourth quarter of fiscal cash generated from the tax benefit of employee stock options of million was offset by significant increases in deferred tax assets of million due to recorded tax benefits associated with losses incurred during the year and decreases in income taxes payable of million resulting from the company s net loss position in other sources of cash were from a decrease in taxes receivable of million from tax refunds received in relating to the prior year and an increase in deferred revenue of million 
additional offsets include increases in prepaid expenses and other assets of million attributed to additional maintenance contracts acquired to support growth in research and engineering and by decreases in accrued expenses of million resulting from a decrease in bonus accruals due to the net loss position in and a decline in payroll accruals due to timing differences associated with a change in the payroll cycle 
net cash provided by operating activities in resulted from net income of million in fiscal  adjusted for aggregate non cash charges associated with depreciation and amortization of million and the amortization of stock based compensation of  increased business volume and the associated increased revenues and billings in from led to significant increases in accounts receivable of million and deferred revenue in the amount of million 
the increase in both categories is primarily due to several large arrangements requiring upfront payments for licensing agreements from which the company will be generating revenues in subsequent periods 
the increases were also the result of annual maintenance renewals with foundries and integrated device manufacturers in the final month of fiscal days sales outstanding for the fiscal fourth quarter of  based on revenues of million and net accounts receivable of million  was  up from days in the fourth quarter of fiscal significant increases in taxes receivable of million from prior year tax refunds and deferred tax assets of million from tax credits and differences in timing of payments was offset by an increase in income tax payable of million resulting from the company s net income position in additional offsets to the increase in cash provided by operating activities were increases in accrued expenses of million consisting of accrued payroll and related expenses of  due to increased headcount and deferred rent of  related to the company s increased facility lease obligations in 
table of contents net cash provided by operating activities in resulted from a net loss of million in fiscal  adjusted for aggregate non cash charges associated with depreciation and amortization of million and the amortization of stock based compensation of million 
reduced revenue levels and timing of customer payments from to led to significant decreases in accounts receivable of million  partially offset by increases in prepaid expenses of million resulting from purchases of software maintenance  a decrease in income taxes payable of million due to the company s loss position  an decrease in deferred revenue of million  and a decrease in accrued expenses of million due to timing of payments 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in the purchase of investments in from is primarily due to short term treasury investing activities 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities in from is due to higher proceeds from the maturity of investments reinvested 
the increase in cash used for investing activities from to is due primarily to increased treasury investing activities 
as a result of lower interest rates  management elected to maintain cash as cash equivalents or shorter term instruments rather than commit funds to longer term instruments at the then current low interest rates 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal and reflects proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million and million  respectively associated with our employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
the company has no off balance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of sales growth  market acceptance of our existing and new technologies  the amount and timing of research and development expenditures  the timing of the introduction of new technologies  expansion of sales and marketing efforts  potential acquisitions  and levels of working capital  primarily accounts receivable 
there can be no assurance that additional equity or debt financing  if required  will be available on satisfactory terms 
we believe that our current capital resources and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next twelve months  although we may seek to raise additional capital during that period and there can be no assurance that we will not require additional financing beyond this time frame

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our core business  the sale of semiconductor ip for the design and manufacture of system on a chip integrated circuits  has exposure to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
a significant portion of our customers are located in asia  canada and europe 
however  to date  our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations has been minimal because all of our license agreements provide for payment in us dollars 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax environments  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility 
our foreign subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
to date these expenses were not significant  therefore  we do not anticipate our future results to be materially adversely impacted by changes in factors affecting international operations 
we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market values of our marketable securities 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various issuers  types and maturities 
we are averse to principal loss and seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
our investments primarily consist of short term money market mutual funds  united states government obligations and mortgage backed securities and commercial paper 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in both fixed and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to rising interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future interest income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the table below presents the carrying values and related weighted average interest rates for our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities
