executive overview emulex is a leading supplier of a broad range of advanced storage networking infrastructure solutions 
our products and technologies leverage an adaptable common architecture that extends from deep within the storage array to the server edge of storage networks 
our storage networking solution offerings include host bus adapters  or hbas  embedded storage switches  storage input output  or i o  controllers and storage area network  or san  storage switch products 
hbas are the data communication products that enable servers to connect to storage networks by offloading communication processing tasks as information is delivered and sent to the storage network 
embedded storage switches and i o controllers are deployed inside storage arrays  tape libraries and other storage appliances  delivering improved performance and reliability and storage connectivity 
the world s largest storage and server oems rely on our highly flexible common architecture to establish a robust foundation for cost effectively integrating a wide array of storage protocols  standards and speeds 
we rely almost exclusively on oems and sales through distribution channels for our revenue 
our oem customers include the world s leading server and storage providers  including bull  dell  emc  engenio  fujitsu ltd  fujitsu siemens  hewlett packard  hitachi data systems  ibm  nec  network appliance  quantum  storagetek  sun microsystems  unisys and xyratex 
our distribution partners include acal  avnet  bell microproducts  info x  netmarks  tech data and tokyo electron 
the market for storage networking infrastructure solutions is concentrated among large oems and  as such  a significant portion of our revenues are generated from sales to a limited number of customers 
we believe that continued investment in next generation storage networking infrastructure solutions is required in order to achieve future revenue growth and profitability 
although we reduced our headcount by in august in an effort to realign our resources  we continue to  and currently plan to invest in research and development  sales and marketing  and capital equipment to deliver leading edge products to our customers  including additional four gigabit per second connectivity solutions  increased linux offerings  and products focused on the small to medium business and blade server markets 
as of july   we had a total of employees 
business combination on november   we completed the cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of vixel corporation 
on november   we completed our acquisition of vixel 
we acquired vixel  a leading supplier of embedded switch asics and subsystems for the storage networking market  to expand our fibre channel product line and paid million in cash for all outstanding common stock  preferred stock and warrants of vixel corporation 
we also incurred acquisition related expenses of million in cash 
in addition  we issued million stock options with a fair value of approximately million and kept the original vesting periods for the options in exchange for the outstanding vixel options for a total acquisition value of million 
we calculated the fair value of the million stock options issued at the date of 
table of contents acquisition using the black scholes option pricing model 
the operations of vixel  since its acquisition  are included within the company s one operating segment  networking products 
convertible subordinated notes offering in  we completed a million private placement of percent convertible subordinated notes due interest is payable in cash on june th and december th of each year beginning june  under the terms of the offering  the notes will be convertible  at the option of the holder and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements contained herein  into shares of emulex common stock at a price of per share 
we incurred total associated bankers fees of million  which were recorded as a reduction of the proceeds from the issuance of the notes and will be accreted over the effective life of the notes  as well as approximately million of other associated debt issuance costs  which have been recorded as an asset and will be amortized over the effective life of the notes 
holders of the notes may require the company to purchase the notes for cash by giving written notice within the business days prior to each of december   december   december   or december  or upon a change in control 
the effective life of our percent convertible subordinated notes due is three years  which is the period up to the first date that the holders can require us to repurchase the notes 
as of july  we have million face value of percent convertible subordinated notes outstanding 
results of operations for emulex corporation and subsidiaries the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data set forth above and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
all references to years refer to our fiscal years ended july   june  and june   as applicable  unless the calendar year is specified 
the following table sets forth certain financial data for the years indicated as a percentage of net revenues

net revenues for fiscal increased million  or three percent  to million  compared to million in fiscal from a product line perspective  net revenues generated from our fibre channel products in were million  an increase of million  or three percent  compared to million in fiscal  and represented substantially all of our net revenues 
the following chart details our net revenues by product line in fiscal and net revenues by product line percentage of percentage of increase percentage net revenues net revenues decrease change in thousands fibre channel ip networking other total net revenues we believe that our net revenues from our fibre channel products are being generated primarily as a result of our product certifications and qualifications with oem customers  which generate both direct oem sales and indirect sales through distribution 
our ip networking products consist of both our iscsi products  as well as legacy vi and clan products 
we expect our vi  clan and traditional networking products  which have all entered end of life status  will contribute negligible revenues to succeeding quarters 
we do not expect material revenue from iscsi products for the foreseeable future 
in addition to direct sales  some of our larger oem customers purchased or marketed products indirectly through distributors  resellers or other third parties 
if these indirect purchases are purchases of customer specific models  we are able to track these sales 
however  if these indirect purchases are purchases of our standard models  we are not able to distinguish them by oem customer 
customers whose direct net revenues  or total direct and indirect net revenues including customer specific models purchased or marketed 
table of contents indirectly through distributors  resellers and other third parties  exceeded percent of our net revenues were as follows net revenues by major customers total direct direct and indirect revenues revenues net revenue percentage emc hewlett packard ibm info x amounts less than percent are not presented 
customer specific models sold indirectly are included with the oem s revenues in these columns rather than as revenue for the distributors  resellers or other third parties 
direct sales to our top five customers accounted for percent of total net revenues in compared to percent of total net revenues in  and we expect to be similarly concentrated in the future 
our net revenues from our customers can be significantly impacted by changes to our customers business and their business models 
under the vendor fulfillment role planned by emc for emc s select program  a portion of the sales of our emc specific models are to be directly purchased by emc from emulex instead of being sold from inventory owned by emc s distribution partners 
our implementation for the emc select program is dependent on emc 
during the year ended july   as fewer emc specific models were sold to emc s distribution partners  the level of inventory held by emc s distribution partners was decreased in preparation for emc s select program  thereby reducing our revenue 
from a sales channel perspective  net revenues generated from oem customers were percent of net revenues and sales through distribution were percent in compared to net revenues from oem customers of percent and sales through distribution of percent in the following chart details our net revenues by sales channel in and net revenues by sales channel percentage of percentage of increase percentage net revenues net revenues decrease change in thousands oem distribution other total net revenues we believe that our net revenues are being generated primarily as a result of product certifications and qualifications with our existing and new oem customers  which take product both directly and through distribution

table of contents net domestic and international revenues percentage of percentage of increase percentage net revenues net revenues decrease change in thousands united states pacific rim countries europe and rest of the world total net revenues we believe the increases in domestic and international net revenues were principally a function of the overall size of the market for fibre channel products and increased market acceptance of our fibre channel products 
we believe the increase in international net revenues at a much higher rate than domestic net revenues is due to the continued increase in market acceptance of fibre channel products outside of the united states 
however  because we sell to oems and distributors who ultimately resell our products to their customers  the geographic mix of our net revenues may not be reflective of the geographic mix of end user demand or installations 
gross profit 
cost of sales included the cost of production of finished products as well as support costs and other expenses related to inventory management  manufacturing quality and order fulfillment 
in  gross profit increased million  or one percent  to million from million in the increase in gross profit in compared to was primarily due to higher net revenues and volumes 
in  cost of sales included million of retention bonuses for terminated employees related to the vixel acquisition and amortized deferred stock based compensation expenses 
gross margin decreased slightly to percent in from percent in due in part to a million benefit to cost of sales resulting from the sale of previously reserved inventory related to our one gigabit per second  or gbps  products 
there was no such reduction to cost of sales in the year the inventory reserve was initially recorded during the first quarter of fiscal engineering and development 
engineering and development expenses consisted primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in the design  development and technical support of our products 
these expenses included third party fees paid to consultants  prototype development expenses and computer services costs related to supporting computer tools used in the engineering and design process 
engineering and development expenses were million and million in and  representing percent and percent of net revenues in and  respectively 
engineering and development expenses increased by million  or nine percent  in compared to this increase was primarily due to the inclusion of the engineering and development expenses associated with our acquisition of vixel for all of versus only a part of the corresponding period of the fiscal year 
since we completed our integration of vixel s day to day operations during the three months ended march   we no longer separately track former vixel operations 
however  the expenses associated with the former vixel operations are estimated to account for approximately million of the overall million increase 
the remaining increase was due to our continued investment in our storage networking infrastructure product development 
engineering and development expenses included million and million of amortized deferred stock based compensation expenses for the fiscal years and  respectively 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consisted primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in the marketing and sales of our products  as well as trade shows  product literature  promotional support costs and other advertising related costs 
selling and marketing expenses were million and million in and  representing nine percent and eight percent of net revenues  respectively 
selling and marketing expenses increased by million  or percent  in  compared to this increase was partially due to the inclusion of the selling and marketing expenses associated with our acquisition of vixel for all of fiscal as opposed to a portion of fiscal as discussed previously  we no longer track former vixel operations separately 
however  the expenses associated with the former vixel operations are estimated to account for approximately million of the 
table of contents overall million increase in selling and marketing expenses 
additionally  due to our increased focus on expanding sales and advertising programs during the year  selling and marketing expenses related to personnel and advertising and other promotions for the year increased by approximately million and million  respectively  compared to the year 
selling and marketing expenses included million and million of amortized deferred stock based compensation expenses for the years and  respectively 
as a portion of selling and marketing expenses  such as selling and marketing employees base compensation and amortized deferred stock based compensation expense  is not driven directly by increases or decreases in net revenues  the expenses fluctuate as a percent of net revenues 
general and administrative 
ongoing general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of salaries and related expenses for executives  financial accounting support  human resources  administrative services  professional fees and other associated corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million and million in and  representing three percent and five percent of net revenues in each period  respectively 
general and administrative expenses for the year included a million reduction related to reimbursement received from our insurance carriers during the period  in excess of our receivable 
this reimbursement  is primarily related to the shareholder litigation settled and recorded as general and administrative expense in the year 
general and administrative expenses for  excluding this million insurance reimbursement  would have been million  or four percent of net revenues  compared to million  or five percent of net revenues  for the year this would represent a decrease of million in the year excluding the insurance recovery  compared to the year similar to other operating expenses  we no longer track former vixel operations separately 
however  the expenses associated with the former vixel operations are estimated to account for approximately million of the decrease in general and administrative expenses  as the majority of the general and administrative costs of vixel corporation were redundant with the general and administrative costs of emulex corporation prior to the acquisition 
additionally  general and administrative expenses related to legal fees  insurance and personnel costs decreased by million  million and million  respectively  in from for the year  general and administrative expenses included million of amortized deferred stock based compensation expenses 
for the year general and administrative expenses included million of retention bonuses for terminated employees related to the vixel acquisition and amortized deferred stock based compensation expenses 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles included the amortization of intangible assets with estimable lives 
in and  amortization was for intangible assets related to the purchase of vixel and the purchase of the technology assets of trebia corporation  which were both completed during  and the purchase of giganet  completed during fiscal the million increase in amortization of intangibles to million in from million in was due to the addition of amortization related to the vixel acquisition and the purchase of the technology assets of trebia corporation for all of fiscal as compared to a portion of fiscal amortization of intangibles represented seven percent and five percent of net revenues in and  respectively 
impairment of goodwill 
on june   we announced that tepid demand experienced in the fourth fiscal quarter of from two of our customers resulted in lower than expected revenue  earnings and cash flows in the fourth fiscal quarter of and was expected to result in lower sequential revenue  earnings and cash flows in the first fiscal quarter of these events and circumstances resulted in a subsequent drop in our stock price  which indicated a potential impairment might have occurred 
as a result  we conducted a sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  analysis  as well as a statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  analysis  including a second step goodwill impairment test 
the results of the sfas no 
analysis indicated that our long lived assets were not impaired 
however  the sfas no 
analysis indicated that goodwill was impaired 
this determination was made at the reporting unit level and consisted of two steps 
first  the fair value of our only reporting unit was determined  based on a market approach  and compared to its carrying amount 
next  as the carrying amount exceeded the fair value  the second step of sfas no 
was performed 
the implied fair value of goodwill was determined by allocating the fair value in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
as a 
table of contents result of this sfas no 
analysis  we recognized a million charge for goodwill impairment during fiscal after recording this impairment charge  there was no goodwill remaining on our balance sheet as of june  in connection with the preparation of vixel corporation s tax return during the year  we revised estimates and discovered errors related to the deferred tax assets of vixel corporation acquired in november 
these events resulted in a revision to vixel s purchase price allocation to decrease net deferred tax assets and increase goodwill  which was impaired 
this resulted in a million impairment of goodwill charge for additionally  during the preparation of the tax provision  we discovered errors related to the deferred tax liabilities of giganet acquired in 
this resulted in a million reduction of the previously recorded goodwill charge of million  resulting in goodwill impairment of million for the year had these items been recorded in  our net loss would have been million higher  or million  instead of million 
we do not believe that this million impairment of goodwill is material to or to operations or financial results 
excluding this adjustment  net income for would have been million 
in process research and development expense 
the in process research and development expense of million  or three percent of net revenues  recorded in the year was related to our acquisition of vixel corporation in november there was no in process research and development expense for the year nonoperating income 
nonoperating income consisted primarily of interest income  interest expense and other non operating income and expense items such as the gain on the repurchase of convertible subordinated notes 
in  our nonoperating income increased by million to million  from nonoperating income of million in the increase was due primarily to an increase in the net overall gain on the repurchase of convertible subordinated notes by million to million in  from million in additionally  interest income increased by million to million in from million in  primarily due to the receipt of million of interest related to an insurance reimbursement  higher overall balances of cash and investments  and some improvement in interest rates 
further  as a result of the lower amount of convertible subordinated notes outstanding during compared to due to the repurchase of convertible subordinated notes during  interest expense decreased by million to million in from million in income taxes 
in  income taxes increased million to million from million in in  we recorded a net loss before income taxes of million  which included goodwill impairment and in process research and development charges of million and million  respectively 
even though we had a loss before income taxes  we recorded income tax expense of million in  as the goodwill impairment and in process research and development charges were not deductible for tax purposes 
excluding the goodwill impairment and in process research and development charges in  income tax expense would have been approximately percent of income before taxes compared to percent in the difference in the tax rate and the tax rate is primarily due to a reduction of state tax expense 
income taxes represented percent and percent of net revenues in and  respectively

our net revenues from our customers can be significantly impacted by changes in the business models of our customers 
our emc specific models are sold both directly to emc and indirectly through distributors such as info x 
as a result  direct revenues attributable to emc were less than percent but direct and indirect revenues attributable to emc were greater than percent of total net revenues

critical accounting policies the preparation of the financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of net revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
if these estimates differ significantly from actual results  the impact to the financial statements may be material 
we believe the following are critical accounting policies and require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  warranty  allowance for doubtful accounts  intangibles and other long lived assets  inventories  income taxes and stock based compensation 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue at the time of shipment when title and risk of loss have passed  evidence of an arrangement has been obtained  pricing is fixed or determinable and collectibility has been reasonably assured 
we make certain sales through two tier distribution channels and have various distribution agreements with selected distributors and master value added resellers  or collectively the distributors 
these distribution agreements may be terminated upon written notice by either party 

table of contents additionally  these distributors are generally given privileges to return a portion of inventory and to participate in price protection and cooperative marketing programs 
therefore  we recognize revenue on our standard products sold to our distributors based on data received from the distributors and management s estimates to approximate the point that these products have been resold by the distributors 
as oem specific models sold to our distributors are governed under the related oem agreements rather than under these distribution agreements  we recognize revenue at the time of shipment to the distributors when title and risk of loss have passed  evidence of an arrangement has been obtained  pricing is fixed or determinable and collectibility has been reasonably assured 
additionally  we maintain accruals and allowances for price protection and cooperative marketing programs 
warranty 
we provide a warranty of between one and five years on our products 
we record a provision for estimated warranty related costs at the time of sale based on historical product return rates and management s estimates of expected future costs to fulfill our warranty obligations 
we evaluate our ongoing warranty obligation on a quarterly basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical write offs as a percentage of net revenues and management s review of outstanding accounts receivable 
amounts due from customers are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts when management believes that collectibility of the amount is unlikely 
although we have not experienced significant losses on accounts receivable historically  our accounts receivable are concentrated with a small number of customers 
consequently  any write off associated with one of these customers could have a significant impact on our allowance for doubtful accounts and results of operations 
intangibles and other long lived assets 
intangibles resulting from the acquisitions of vixel and giganet and the purchase of the technology assets of trebia corporation are carried at cost less accumulated amortization 
for assets with determinable useful lives  amortization is computed using the straight line method over the estimated economic lives of the respective intangible assets  ranging from two to seven years 
goodwill and intangibles that have indeterminate lives will be tested for impairment based on discounted cash flows and market capitalization at least annually  but also on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred 
all goodwill of approximately million was impaired in furthermore  periodically we assess whether our long lived assets including intangibles  should be tested for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured based on fair value  which is determined using projected discounted future operating cash flows 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
we use a standard cost system for purposes of determining cost 
the standards are adjusted periodically to ensure they represent actual cost 
we regularly compare forecasted demand and the composition of the forecast against inventory on hand and open purchase commitments in an effort to ensure the carrying value of inventory does not exceed net realizable value 
accordingly  we may have to record reductions to the carrying value of excess and obsolete inventory if forecasted demand decreases  as we have previously recorded  including an excess and obsolete inventory charge of million during the three months ended september  income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  which recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for tax effected net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we regularly review historical and anticipated future pre tax results of operations to determine whether we will be able to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is required to reduce the potential deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be 
table of contents realized due to the lack of sufficient taxable income 
as of july   we have a valuation allowance of million established against capital loss carryforwards 
stock compensation 
we account for our stock based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method 
stock compensation awards to non employees  if any  are recorded using the fair value method 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires that the compensation cost related to share based payment transactions  measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued  be recognized in the financial statements 
determining the fair value of options using the black scholes model  or other currently accepted option valuation models  requires highly subjective assumptions  including future stock price volatility and expected time until exercise  which greatly affect the calculated fair value on the grant date 
sfas no 
r is required for our first interim period of fiscal  which will be the three months ending october  although the company has not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas  the company is evaluating the requirements under sfas r and expects the adoption to have a significant impact on the company s consolidated statements of operations and net income per share

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
interest rate sensitivity at july   our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed income securities  excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents  of million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity 
currently  the carrying amount of these securities approximates fair market value 
however  the fair market value of these securities is subject to interest rate risk and would decline in value if market interest rates increased 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from the levels existing as of july   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material to our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
however  if interest rates decreased and securities within our portfolio matured and were re invested in securities with lower interest rates  interest income would decrease in the future 
as of july   we have million face value percent convertible subordinated notes issued and outstanding 
the fair value  based on quoted market prices  of our percent convertible subordinated notes at july   was million 
the fair value of these notes may increase or decrease due to various factors  including fluctuations in the market price of our common stock  fluctuations in market interest rates and fluctuations in general economic conditions 
foreign currency we have executed and will continue to execute transactions in foreign currencies 
as a result  we may be exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency rates  particularly the british pound and the euro 
given the relatively small number of foreign currency transactions  we do not believe that our potential exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates is significant
