table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion of our financial conditions and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included in schedule i to this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements 
please see risk factors in item business above for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
applica is a marketer and distributor of a broad range of branded small household appliances 
applica markets and distributes kitchen products  home products  pest control products  pet care products and personal care products 
applica markets products under licensed brand names  such as black decker  and its own brand names  such as windmere  littermaid  belson and applica 
applica s customers include mass merchandisers  specialty retailers and appliance distributors primarily in north america  latin america and the caribbean 
applica also operates a manufacturing facility in mexico 
the small electric consumer goods sector of the household appliance industry is a mature industry characterized by intense competition based on price  quality  retail shelf space  product design  trade names  new product introduction  marketing and distribution approaches 
applica competes with both domestic and international distributors and manufacturers primarily at mid tier price points 
we continuously have to balance the cost of our products  without compromising quality  with the price constraints from our customers 
the prices of raw materials such as copper  steel and plastics have significantly increased in recent years and are expected to continue to be high in the foreseeable future 
this has negatively impacted our gross margins by increasing the price we pay for our products and is expected to continue to negatively impact our margins in we have been focused on making changes to combat the margin pressures resulting from the combination of the inflation of raw materials prices and the deflationary pressures from the retail environment 
the most significant steps taken recently were the downsizing and ultimate sale of our manufacturing operations in hong kong  the downsizing of our manufacturing operations in mexico  the establishment of strategic sourcing partners and joint product development relationships 
we are also continuing to focus on innovative products with proprietary technologies  design and higher margins 
we continue to rationalize our mexican manufacturing operations 
in  we shifted a significant amount of production from mexico to third parties in china 
as part of the rationalization  we also plan to sell the building housing our factory in mexico 
in  we began to reduce our mexican manufacturing capacity to reflect only the volume needed for the mexican marketplace  which will continue into additionally  in late  we initiated an annual product and customer profitability review 
through this process  management identifies products sold to customers that do not meet applica s product profitability threshold 
once those products are identified  management either requests a price increase from the applicable customer or cost reductions from the applicable supplier 
if the combination of price increases and cost reductions does not increase the product s profitability to meet the threshold  applica will not offer such product to the customer 
this initiative will significantly reduce the number of products we offer in and beyond 
as a result  we expect our sales volume to decrease in  however  this process is expected to result in higher gross margin percentages 
outlook this section contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act 
such forward looking statements are subject to certain risks  uncertainties or assumptions and may be affected by certain other factors  including the specific factors set forth in risk factors in item business above 
you should carefully consider these risk factors  together with the other information contained in this annual report on form k for the year ended december   in evaluating us and our business before making an investment decision regarding our securities 

table of contents we intend to update this outlook section in our quarterly reports on form q subsequently filed with the sec  however  applica disclaims any intention or obligation to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any of the forward looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments 
management anticipates that net sales for the year ended december  will be between million and million 
the decrease in sales will primarily result from the elimination of sales of certain products identified in our product and customer profitability review that did not meet our profitability threshold  the loss of a significant portion of our contract manufacturing sales as the result of the sale of our hong kong based manufacturing operations in july which sales totaled million in  and the sale of the jerdon hotel and hospitality division in october which had sales of million in 
earnings for are expected to be between and per diluted share 
management anticipates that gross margins will be approximately in management expects gross margins to increase in as the result of the product and customer profitability review initiated for  and the continued shift of the manufacture of products from mexico to china 
the gross margin guidance includes continued mexican manufacturing restructuring costs of up to million 
see additional information on the mexican restructuring below 
management expects that selling  general and administrative operating expenses will decrease to approximately of sales as the result of improvements in freight and warehousing resulting from lower sales and lower average inventory  as well as improved product flow as we complete our manufacturing to sourcing transition  a planned decrease in national advertising  and lower legal and consulting fees 
management expects to record earnings of approximately to million relating to the receipt of escrowed funds from the sale of an investment by a joint venture  which was owned by applica and which has been liquidated 
management anticipates having depreciation expense of approximately million in and amortization expense of approximately million 
management anticipates that interest expense will increase to approximately million for as the result of higher interest rates 
management anticipates that the effective tax rate for will be capital expenditures are planned to be approximately million  driven by new products and the final stages of our information technology erp initiative 
management expects that capital expenditures for our mexican manufacturing operations will decrease in as we continue to downsize our manufacturing operations in mexico 
for the quarter ended march   we believe that sales will be between million and million and there will be a loss per share of to 

table of contents mexico restructuring 
we continue to rationalize our mexican manufacturing operations 
management will continue to downsize the mexican manufacturing facilities and expects to incur up to an additional million in restructuring costs in  of which up to million could be cash severance costs 
as part of such rationalization  we plan to sell the building housing our factory in mexico  which we expect will result in a gain over the current book value 
the expected restructuring costs set forth above do not reflect the expected gain on the sale of the building 
as part of our continued downsizing efforts in mexico  we will be producing the next generation of the home caf coffee maker at a third party supplier in china 
as part of the transition  we pre built all of the first generation home caf coffee maker needed in in the first two months of as a result  in the first quarter  we incurred a portion of the million in restructuring cost  which was related to the home caf production and which did not qualify for accrual at year end 
the machinery and equipment related to the home caf production in mexico and excess raw materials inventory were reduced to their fair value as of december  and a corresponding impairment charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of american jobs creation act 
we are still evaluating the impact to applica from the recent enactment of the american jobs creation act of this law provides for a temporary dividends received deduction on reinvested dividends from controlled foreign corporations to the us applica repatriated million during the fourth quarter of certain of these dividends may be excluded from taxable income pursuant to the act and may result in future tax benefits 
blender recall 
in march  applica  in cooperation with the consumer products safety commission  voluntarily recalled approximately  black decker branded bl  bl and bl blenders 
costs and expenses related to this recall are being reimbursed by the supplier who manufactured the blenders 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes included in schedule i to this annual report on form k 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to our financial statements 
applica believes that of its critical accounting policies  the following had a significant effect on the operations for and income taxes 
applica is subject to income tax laws in many countries 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in applica s financial statements and tax returns 
significant management judgment is required in developing applica s provision for income taxes  including the determination of foreign tax liabilities  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required to be applied against the deferred tax assets 
applica evaluates its ability to realize its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and adjusts the amount of its valuation allowance  if necessary 
applica operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in those jurisdictions 
because of the complex issues involved  any claims can require an extended period to resolve 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made 
applica records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that applica believes will more likely than not be realized 
while applica has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to tax expense in the period such determination is made 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination is made 
collectibility of accounts receivable 
applica records allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments on their balances 
we assess the credit worthiness of our customers based on multiple sources of information and analyze factors including 
table of contents our historical bad debt experiences  publicly available information regarding our customers and the inherent credit risk related to them  information from subscription based credit reporting companies  trade association data and reports  current economic trends  and changes in customer payment terms or payment patterns 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
if the financial condition of our customers were to worsen  additional write offs may be required 
such write offs may not be included in the allowance for doubtful accounts at december   resulting in a charge to income in the period such determination is made 
conversely  if the financial condition of our customers were to improve or our judgment regarding their financial condition was to change positively  a reduction in the allowances may be required resulting in an increase in income in the period such determination is made 
inventory 
applica values inventory at the lower of cost or market  using the first in  first out fifo method  and regularly reviews the book value of discontinued product lines and stock keeping units skus to determine if these items are properly valued 
if market value is less than cost  applica writes down the related inventory to the estimated net realizable value 
applica regularly evaluates the composition of inventory to identify slow moving and obsolete inventories to determine if additional write downs are required 
this valuation requires significant judgment from management as to the saleability of its inventory based on forecasted sales 
it is particularly difficult to judge the potential sales of new products 
should the forecasted sales not materialize  it would have a significant impact on applica s result of operations and the valuation of its inventory  resulting in a charge to income in the period such determination is made 
product liability claims and litigation 
applica is subject to lawsuits and other claims related to product and other matters that are being defended and handled in the ordinary course of business 
we maintain accruals for such costs that may be incurred  which are determined on a case by case basis  taking into consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes  as well as the potential range of probable loss 
the accruals are monitored on an ongoing basis and are updated for new developments or new information as appropriate 
with respect to product liability claims  applica estimates the amount of ultimate liability in excess of applicable insurance coverage based on historical claims experience and current claim estimates  as well as other available facts and circumstances 
we believe that the amount of ultimate liability of our current claims and litigation matters  if any  is not likely to have a material effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
however  as the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict  unfavorable significant changes in the estimated exposures could occur resulting in a charge to income in the period such determination is made 
conversely  if favorable changes in the estimated exposures occur  a reduction in the accruals may be required resulting in an increase in income in the period such determination is made 
goodwill 
on an annual basis  management assesses the composition of applica s assets and liabilities  as well as the events that have occurred and the circumstances that have changed since the most recent fair value determination 
if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of goodwill below its carrying amount  goodwill will be tested for impairment 
applica selected june th as the annual impairment test date 
applica may also test earlier if facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a potential impairment 
the test for impairment is based upon a number of factors  including operating results  business plans and projected future cash flows 
applica wrote off its remaining goodwill of million in the second quarter of long lived assets 
applica reviews long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of its intangible assets  management performs an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the individual assets over the remaining amortization period 
applica recognizes an impairment loss if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the expected future cash flows 

table of contents other estimates 
estimates in connection with specific events have a significant effect on accruals for  among others  the consolidation of operations  plant closings  reduction in employees and product recalls 
applica makes a number of other estimates in the ordinary course of business relating to sales returns and allowances  warranty accruals  and accruals for promotional incentives 
historically  changes to these estimates have not had a material impact on our financial condition but have significantly affected operations from time to time 
however  circumstances could change which may alter future expectations

sales for the household product segment for the year ended december  increased from million to million 
for the year ended december  sales of black decker branded products increased by million to million  and sales of littermaid branded products increased by million to million 
in  sales of black decker branded products increased as the result of the introduction of several new products  including the home caf single cup brewing system  which was co developed with the procter gamble company  and the success of lids off jar opener and new items introduced under the gizmo sub brand 
additionally  starting in the second quarter of  the majority of our pest products were marketed under the black decker brand 
these increases were offset by decreases in sales of windmere  weitech pest control and other branded products of million to million 
sales for the professional personal care segment for the year ended december  decreased from million to million over the period 
this decrease was primarily the result of the sale of the jerdon 
table of contents hotel and hospitality business in october sales of products by the jerdon division totaled million in and million in sales for the manufacturing segment for the year ended december  decreased from million to million over the period 
in  the intersegment sales decreased from million to million 
in  contract manufacturing decreased from million to million  primarily as the result of the sale of our hong kong based manufacturing operations in july contract manufacturing sales from our hong kong manufacturing operations were million in and million in restructuring charges 
in  applica incurred restructuring charges of million  primarily relating to the continued downsizing of its mexican manufacturing operations 
we continue to rationalize our mexican manufacturing operations 
management will continue to downsize the mexican manufacturing facilities and expects to incur up to an additional million in restructuring costs in as part of such rationalization  we plan to sell the building housing our factory in queretaro  mexico  which we expect will result in a gain over the current book value 
additionally  we continue to reduce our mexican manufacturing capacity to reflect only the volume needed for the mexican marketplace 
we expect these events to occur within the next months  however  not necessarily in the same quarter 
in  applica incurred restructuring charges relating to its reduction of fixed costs and capacity at its chinese and mexican manufacturing operations 
we reduced the labor force in our chinese facilities and closed one factory  which resulted in restructuring costs of approximately million 
additionally  applica incurred approximately million in restructuring costs associated with its downsizing of its mexican manufacturing operations related to the movement of production of irons and toaster ovens to lower cost suppliers in the far east 
product recall expenses 
in february  applica voluntarily recalled approximately million black decker branded t and t toasters 
in  applica took a charge to cost of sales of million relating to the estimated expenses of such recalls 
in and   and million were charged against the accrual  respectively 
during  recall claims continued to diminish considerably 
in the fourth quarter of  management determined that an accrual related to the product recall was no longer required and million of such accrual was reversed and was included as a reduction of cost of sales 
in march  applica  in cooperation with the consumer products safety commission  voluntarily recalled approximately  black decker branded bl  bl and bl blenders 
costs and expenses related to this recall are being reimbursed by the supplier who manufactured the blenders 
gross profit 
applica s gross profit increased by million to million in as the result of higher sales volume 
applica s gross profit margin as a percentage of sales increased slightly to for the year ended december  as compared to for the gross profit margin increase was primarily attributed to the movement of production of core products from our manufacturing facility in mexico to third parties in china  a better overall product mix  and lower unabsorbed costs at our manufacturing facilities  primarily in the first half of  due to higher production levels compared to the same period in the increase was offset primarily by restructuring charges of million incurred in  primarily relating to our downsizing of our mexican and chinese manufacturing operations  and higher prices for raw materials 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for applica increased million  or  for the year ended december  to million as compared to the following factors contributed to the increase in operating expenses in compared to increases of million in freight and distribution expenses  increases of million in royalty expenses  primarily related to black decker royalties  and increases of million in advertising and promotional expenses 
the increase in freight and distribution expenses was primarily the result of late product deliveries from our factories and suppliers which resulted in the need to expedite orders directly to our customers nationwide at a significant premium 
additionally  increases in sales volume and fuel costs contributed to the increase 
these increases were partially offset by lower amortization of intangible assets of million  primarily related to the write off of the unamortized book value of an intangible asset related to the black decker tradename in the fourth quarter of  and a decrease in legal expenses of million  primarily as the result of the significant legal expenses related to the tilia litigation  which was settled in operating expenses decreased as a percentage of sales to in from in the period primarily as the result of higher sales volume in leveraging fixed costs 
termination benefits 
in the third quarter of  applica incurred termination costs of approximately million related to the resignation of applica s chairman of the board and the termination of certain other employment and consulting agreements and relationships 
gain on the sale of subsidiary  division and property 
in the third quarter of  we sold applica durable manufacturing limited  our hong kong manufacturing subsidiary  and recorded a loss on the sale of approximately million  primarily from the realization of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold the jerdon hotel and hospitality division and recorded a gain on sale of approximately million 
also in the fourth quarter  we sold our executive offices located in miami lakes  florida  which resulted in a gain of approximately million 
restructuring and other credits charges 
in the first quarter of  we settled an outstanding litigation matter for  and reversed the remaining accrual of  related to such litigation 
in  applica incurred additional expenses of million relating to its previous decision to consolidate its shelton  connecticut office with the headquarters located in miami lakes  florida 
applica was unable to rent a majority of the facility for the remainder of its lease as originally planned 
impairment of goodwill 
as of june   we performed our annual fair value assessment of goodwill  with the assistance of an independent third party valuation group  and determined that the implied value of applica s goodwill was zero  resulting in a non cash adjustment in the carrying value of goodwill of million 
the impairment charge was included as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations of in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  the testing for impairment of goodwill is performed in two steps potential impairment is identified by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill  and if fair value is less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss is estimated as the excess of the carrying amount of the goodwill over its implied value 
the impairment of goodwill was primarily due to lower than expected cash flows  resulting from lower than anticipated gross profit margins attributable to increased costs of raw materials and higher transportation costs  which are expected to continue for the foreseeable future 
the implied fair value of goodwill was estimated using a combination of market multiples  comparable transactions and discounted cash flow methodologies 

table of contents the implied fair value of goodwill was determined by allocating applica s fair value to all of applica s assets and liabilities 
any excess of fair value over the amount allocated represented implied fair value of goodwill 
the allocation process was performed solely for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment 
thus  the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities  other than goodwill  were not affected 
the fair value of the individual assets is the amount at which an asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction not involving a forced or liquidating sale 
the fair value of the individual liabilities is the amount at which a liability could be incurred or settled in a current transaction not involving a forced or liquidating sale 
in our process of allocating the fair value to applica s tangible assets  primarily accounts receivable  inventory and manufacturing property  plant and equipment in mexico  and identifiable intangible assets ie  customer relationships and tradenames and liabilities  we determined that the implied value of goodwill the residual was zero 
impairment of intangible asset 
in june  applica acquired the household products group of the black decker corporation for million in cash and assumed certain related liabilities 
as part of the acquisition  applica acquired the right to use the black decker trademark in four product categories garment care  cooking  food preparation and beverage 
applica has the right to sell products under this license agreement in north america  central america  and south america  excluding brazil 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the acquired net assets was million  of which million was allocated to an intangible asset related to the black decker trademark and the remaining million was allocated to goodwill 
the million assigned to the fair value of the intangible asset was based on a valuation analysis performed by applica as of june for the first five years through june   the license was on a royalty free basis for the core product categories 
mutually agreed upon renewals were to be at the stated royalty rate  along with specified minimum royalty payments 
the agreement provided for an initial period of five years  with a subsequent five year extended term and up to three additional five year extensions 
beginning in  sales of black decker branded products under the original four product categories began to decrease significantly  which decrease continued through december  sales of black decker branded products under the original four product categories for   and were million  million and million  respectively 
as a result of the continuation of the lower sales of black decker branded products in the four core product categories in the third and fourth quarter of which are applica s busiest quarters due to the seasonality of our business  management determined that a triggering event had occurred in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
accordingly  applica performed a valuation analysis by calculating the expected effective royalty rate in through  taking into account the minimum royalties  as well as the projected sales of black decker branded products under the original four categories 
based on the valuation analysis  management believed that there was no remaining value in the initial intangible asset as of december  accordingly  applica recorded an impairment charge of approximately million to write off the unamortized book value of the intangible asset 
the impairment charge was reflected in the fourth quarter of because the decreased fourth quarter sales provided further confirmation of an impairment 
pursuant to the requirements of sfas and as a result of applica s valuation analysis  the impairment charge was classified as a component of income from operations 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million  or  to million in as compared to million in as the result of lower debt levels and lower average interest rates 
the lower debt levels resulted from the redemption of million of our senior subordinated notes due during the second half of and the redemption of million in february loss on early extinguishment of debt 
in february  applica redeemed million of our notes 
the notes were redeemed at prices between and of the principal amount  plus accrued interest 
the cost of the redemption included  in prepayment premiums and the pro rata write off of deferred financing costs related to the redemption 
in july  october and november  applica redeemed a total of million of the notes 
the notes were redeemed at prices between and of the principal amount  plus accrued interest 
the cost of the redemption included million in prepayment premiums and million related to the pro rata write off of deferred financing costs 

table of contents equity in net earnings of joint venture 
in july  zoneperfect nutrition company  an investment held by a partnership that was owned by applica  was sold for approximately million 
such sale resulted in an increase in net earnings of joint ventures of million in a portion of the sale price was being held in escrow as of december  and  million of which is owed to applica 
half of this amount million was recorded as part of the increase in net earnings of joint ventures in management believed that the collection of the remaining million was uncertain and  therefore  such amount was not recorded into income as of december  in july  the general partner of the partnership began the process of dissolving the partnership by distributing the remaining individual investments to the partners 
the partnership was dissolved in the third quarter of vendor consideration 
applica s supplier of vacuum packaging products has agreed to reimburse us million for a portion of the costs of litigating a patent infringement matter with tilia international  inc the reimbursement is evidenced by an unsecured note receivable bearing interest at per annum and is payable in equal quarterly installments of  plus interest  over five years 
we believe that the ultimate collection of the note receivable is not assured and is dependent on applica s future purchases from the supplier 
therefore  the amount collected on the note receivable is recorded on the cash basis over the five year period as a reduction of future product costs 
applica recorded  principal plus interest as a reduction of cost of goods sold for the year ended december  taxes 
applica s tax provision is based on an estimated annual aggregation of the taxes on earnings of each of its foreign and domestic operations 
for  applica incurred a tax expense of million  which included the impact of an impairment of goodwill  a provision for previously untaxed foreign earnings  and additional valuation allowances on deferred tax assets 
for  applica incurred a tax expense of million 
in the second quarter of  applica changed its position regarding the permanent investment of certain foreign undistributed earnings  primarily as a result of its decision to exit its hong kong based manufacturing operations 
in the fourth quarter of  applica repatriated million of the million of the previously untaxed earnings for which a related tax expense of million was recorded in the second quarter of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
a review of all available positive and negative evidence needs to be considered  including a company s current and past performance  the market environment in which the company operates  the utilization of past tax credits  length of carryback and carryforward periods 
forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative objective evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment 
as a result of its quarterly reviews  applica concluded that it was appropriate to record additional valuation allowances of million in applica expects to realize the benefits of the remaining net deferred tax assets of approximately million as of december   primarily from identified tax planning strategies 
we expect to continue to maintain a valuation allowance on certain future tax benefits until an appropriate level of profitability is reached or we are able to develop tax strategies which would enable us to conclude that it is more likely than not that a portion of our net deferred tax assets would be realized 
we are still evaluating the impact on applica of the recent enactment of the american jobs creation act of this law provides for a temporary dividends received deduction on reinvested dividends from controlled foreign corporations to the us applica repatriated million during the fourth quarter of certain of these dividends may be excluded from taxable income pursuant to the act and may result in future tax benefits

we expect our operating expenses to remain similar to historical percentages of sales 
we expect our black and decker royalty payments to increase as sales of black decker branded products increase 
our interest costs will fluctuate based upon interest rates  as well as our ability to generate cash flow to pay down debt 
the table above provides a summary of other future expected cash obligations 
in addition  we require funds for capital expenditures for tooling for new products  information technology improvements and other improvements 
beginning in  capital expenditures are anticipated to be less than prior years  as a result of the sale of our hong kong based manufacturing operations  the downsizing of our manufacturing operations in mexico and the completion of the first phase of our erp implementation 
additionally  in  we will pay approximately million in cash severance benefits to terminated executives and senior management

sources and uses of cash operating activities 
in  applica s operations used million in cash flow  compared with the generation of cash of million in the decrease in operating cash flows from the prior year was principally due to higher working capital to support the higher sales recorded in we experienced higher sales mainly due to the growth in sales of black and decker branded products 
in addition  inventory was higher during as we built transitional inventory to support the sale of our hong kong manufacturing operations and the transition of production of certain products from mexico to china 
we expect working capital requirements to be lower  as we are anticipating lower level of sales as a result of our customer and product review process initiatives  as well as less transitional inventory 
our results of operations for the periods discussed have not been significantly affected by inflation or foreign currency fluctuation 
we generally negotiate our purchase orders with our foreign manufacturers in united states dollars 
thus  our cost under any purchase order is not subject to change after the time the order is placed due to exchange rate fluctuations 
however  the weakening of the united states dollar against local currencies could result in certain manufacturers increasing the united states dollar prices for future product purchases 
in addition  applica uses foreign exchange contracts  which usually mature within one year  to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions  primarily us dollar inventory purchases by our foreign commercial subsidiaries in canada and latin america

effect of inflation our results of operations for the periods discussed have not been significantly affected by inflation 

table of contents currency matters while we transact business predominantly in us dollars and most of our revenues are collected in us dollars  a portion of our costs  such as payroll  rent and indirect operational costs  are denominated in other currencies  such as hong kong dollars and mexican pesos 
in addition  while a small portion of our revenues are collected in foreign currencies  such as canadian dollars  argentine pesos  colombian pesos  chilean pesos and venezuelan bolivars  a significant portion of the related cost of goods sold are denominated in us dollars 
changes in the relation of these and other currencies to the us dollar will affect our cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange losses 
the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations cannot be accurately predicted 
the dollar foreign exchange rates may not be stable in the future and fluctuations in financial markets may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time  applica uses forward exchange and option contracts to reduce fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related to finished goods and other operating purchases 
the purpose of applica s foreign currency management activity is to reduce the risk that anticipated cash flows and earnings from foreign currency denominated transactions may be affected by changes in exchange rates

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk applica is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currencies using a variety of financial instruments 
interest rate sensitivity 
our primary market risk exposure with respect to interest rates is changes in short and long term interest rates in the united states 
certain of applica s debt arrangements represent floating rate debt and accordingly  we are subject to interest rate risk 
applica uses interest rate risk management contracts to manage our fixed to floating ratio  which may reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on our floating rate debt 
our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings 
applica maintains fixed rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between a minimum and maximum percentage  which is set by policy 
the tables below provide information regarding applica s derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest rate swaps and debt obligations 

table of contents for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments expected to be exchanged under the contract 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date

the variable rate revolving foreign trade facility is set at a rate equivalent to the libor rate plus 
the variable rate revolving credit facility is set depending upon the interest period elected by applica one  two  three or six months at a rate equivalent to the libor rate plus an applicable margin based upon applica s leverage ratio as of december  or at a rate equivalent to the prime rate plus an applicable margin based upon applica s leverage ratio zero as of december  
at december   applica had an interest rate swap contract to pay a variable rate of interest of six month libor in arrears plus and receive a fixed rate of interest at that matures on july  the libor used to calculate the average pay rate is based upon the forward yield curve as of december  at december  expected maturity date there fair after total value dollars in thousands liabilities debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate interest rate contracts interest rate swaps pay fixed average pay rate average receive rate

our primary market risk exposure with respect to exchange rates is to changes in us dollar mexican peso  us dollar hong kong dollar and us dollar canadian dollar exchange rates 
in addition  we also have exposure to the argentinean peso  colombian peso  chilean peso and venezuelan bolivar 
certain forecasted transactions could expose applica to foreign currency risk 
we purchase currency forwards and options as cash flow hedges of foreign currency forecasted transactions related to the purchase of third party raw materials and other operating expenses 
our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges 
accordingly  we enter into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of our existing foreign currency assets  liabilities  commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues and expenses 
applica uses option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the sale or purchase of foreign currencies to hedge probable  but not firmly committed expenditures 
the principal currencies hedged are the mexican peso  hong kong dollar and canadian dollar 
by policy  applica maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures for periods not to exceed eighteen months 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures 
as discussed above  we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in foreign exchange rates 
as of december   applica hedged a portion of its estimated foreign currency transactions using forward exchange contracts and purchased options 
we use a sensitivity model to determine a potential change in the fair value of our foreign exchange financial instruments 
the sensitivity model estimates the change in fair value based upon a favorable and unfavorable movement of in the respective spot rate 
the sensitivity model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses or gains in fair value that will be incurred by applica 
it should also be noted that the change in value represents the estimated change in the fair market value of the derivative 
because the derivatives hedge an underlying exposure  there would be a comparable and opposite change 
table of contents in value of the underlying exposure 
the estimated potential change in fair value  calculated using the sensitivity model  is as follows at december  change in fair value due to notional hedge favorable unfavorable amount in us dollars movement in spot movement in spot dollars in thousands canadian dollar it is our policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet our objectives as stated above 
we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes
