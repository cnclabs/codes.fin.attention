item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following presents a review of knbt bancorp s results of operations and financial condition 
this information should be read in conjunction with knbt s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to financial statements 
knbt s consolidated earnings are derived primarily from the operations of its wholly owned savings bank subsidiary  keystone nazareth bank trust company  and its other subsidiaries 
knbt s results of operations depend  to a large extent  on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on its loan and investment portfolios and interest expense on deposits and borrowings 
non interest income  non interest expense and the provision for loan losses also impact knbt s results of operations 
non interest income consists primarily of fees and service charges related to deposits and lending activities  fees from other banking and non banking operations  loan servicing and other non interest income 
non interest expense primarily consists of compensation and employee benefits  office occupancy and equipment expense  data processing  advertising and business promotion and other expenses 
knbt s results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
future changes in applicable law  regulations or government policies may materially impact knbt s financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of knbt conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and general practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
knbt considers that the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its other significant accounting policies 
the allowance for loan losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable credit losses 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors 
however  this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates  including  among others  expected default probabilities  loss given default  expected commitment usage  the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  mortgages  and general amounts for historical loss experience 
the process also considers economic conditions  uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
all of these factors may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provisions for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
knbt recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax effects of temporary differences  net operating loss carry forwards and tax credits 
deferred tax assets are subject to management s judgment based upon available evidence that future realization is more likely than not 
if management determines that knbt may be unable to realize all or part of net deferred tax assets in the future  a direct charge to income tax expense may be required to reduce the recorded value of the net deferred tax asset to the expected realizable amount 
goodwill  under sfas no 
 is subject to impairment testing at least annually to determine whether write downs of the recorded balance is necessary 
knbt tests for impairment based on the goodwill maintained at each defined reporting unit 
a fair value is determined for each reporting unit based on at least one of three various market valuation methodologies 
if the fair values of the reporting units exceed their book values  no write down of recorded goodwill is necessary 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less  an expense may be required on knbt s books to write down the related goodwill to the proper carrying value 
knbt recorded goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets as a result of the acquisition of first colonial in october operating strategy knbt was organized in by keystone savings bank in connection with its mutual to stock conversion and as the holding company for the bank 
historically  keystone savings bank operated as a traditional savings bank primarily providing single family residential mortgage loans and a variety of retail products and services to its customers 
concurrent with the conversion on october   first colonial was merged with and into knbt and nazareth national bank and trust company was merged into the bank 
historically  nazareth national bank and trust company was a full service community commercial bank with full trust services 
the resulting bank  keystone nazareth bank trust company is a pennsylvania chartered stock savings bank 
some of the bank s key operating strategies and characteristics are described below 
o maintain current branch network system with branch offices located throughout lehigh  northampton  monroe and carbon counties  pennsylvania with consideration for additional branches in the future 
o continue to develop as a relationship bank offering a broad array of deposit and loan products as well as securities and insurance products and trust services 
o accelerate core deposit growth  utilizing strong deposit market share particularly in northampton and lehigh counties in which the bank has the largest and second largest  respectively  deposit market share 
overall  the bank estimates that it has the second largest deposit share in the lehigh valley 
o focus on asset generation that continues the bank s success in growing commercial and consumer loan portfolios without sacrificing credit quality 
intensify efforts targeting small to mid sized businesses in the lehigh valley 
o ensure customer satisfaction by delivering unmatched personal service and provide high quality products and services to meet the changing needs of individuals  families and businesses 
o grow and diversify our operations as a community bank 
o execute capital management strategy 
comparison of financial condition at december  and december  knbt had a net income for of million compared with a net loss of million in the results for included one time charges aggregating million pre tax resulting from the million contribution to the keystone nazareth charitable foundation and million of merger related and systems integration related charges incurred in connection with the merger with first colonial 
knbt s net income was million in knbt s return on average assets was in as compared to in and in the return on average equity was   and in  and  respectively 
knbt s total assets increased by million  or  to billion at december  compared to billion at december  this increase in total assets was due primarily to an increase in investment securities and net loans receivable which was partially offset by decreases in cash and cash equivalents 
for the year ended december   knbt s investment securities increased by million  or to billion at december  compared to million at december  as knbt implemented its asset liability management strategy 
knbt s net loans receivable  including mortgage loans held for sale  increased by million  or to billion at december  compared to million at december  cash and cash equivalents decreased from million  or  from million at december  to million at december  such decrease primarily reflects knbt s purchases of investment securities during the fiscal year 
knbt s total liabilities increased million  or from million at december  to million at december  the increase was primarily due to a million  or increase in fhlb advances which were used to fund the increase in the investment securities 
total deposits increased million  or  to billion at december  compared to december  shareholders equity totaled million at december  compared to million at december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease in shareholders equity was principally the result of the purchase of  shares of knbt s stock to fund the stockholder approved management recognition and retention plan mrrp at an average cost of per share combined with the repurchase of  shares of its common stock  in connection with the board of directors authorized stock repurchase program  at an average cost of per share 
analysis of net interest income net interest income represents the difference between income on interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income also depends upon the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rate earned or paid on them 
net interest income is the primary source of earnings for knbt 
therefore  changes in net interest income are an important factor in knbt s overall net income 
net interest income 
knbt s net interest income was million for  a million or increase when compared to million for the major factors in the increases in both interest income and interest expense were the increased average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities due to the acquisition of first colonial on october   the use of the net proceeds from knbt s initial public offering completed on october   and an increase in fhlb advances which were used to fund the increase in the investment portfolio 
knbt s average interest earning assets totaled billion at december  as compared to billion at december  total interest income was million for  a million or increase when compared to the million in total interest income for average interest bearing liabilities were billion at december  compared to billion at december  total interest expense was million for  a million or increase when compared to the million in total interest expense for net interest income  in  increased million or from the level of million 
this increase was primarily the result of an increase in the average balances of investment securities and interest bearing balances with banks including a decrease in the average rate paid on interest bearing deposits  partially offset by an increase in fhlb borrowings 
average balances  net interest income  and yields earned and rates paid 
the following table shows for the periods indicated the total dollar amount of interest from average interest earnings assets and the resulting yields  as well as the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  expressed both in dollars and rates  and the net interest margin 
the table includes information adjusted to a tax equivalent yield basis for knbt s tax exempt investment securities 
the presentation on a tax equivalent basis may be considered to include non gaap information 
management believes that it is a common industry practice in the banking industry to present such information on a fully tax equivalent basis and that such information is useful to investors in making peer comparisons 
the tax exempt adjustments and comparable gaap information also is included in the table

the indicated interest income and average yields are presented on a taxable equivalent basis 
the taxable equivalent adjustments included above are million  million  and  for the years   and  respectively 
the effective tax rate used for the taxable equivalent adjustment was 
loan fees of  million  and million for the years   and  respectively  are included in interest income 
average loan balances include non accruing loans of million  million  and million and average loans held for sale of million  million  and million for the years of   and  respectively 
net interest spread is the arithmatic difference between yield on interest earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin is computed by dividing net interest income by average interest earning assets 
rate volume analysis 
the following table shows the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities affected knbt s interest income and expense during the periods indicated 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to changes in rate  which is the change in rate multiplied by prior year volume  and changes in volume  which is the change in volume multiplied by prior year rate 
the combined effect of changes in both rate and volume has been allocated proportionately to the change due to rate and the change due to volume 
amounts shown are on a tax equivalent basis

the volume related change resulted primarily from increases in investment securities and net loans see the discussion in business lending activities  an increase in deposits  particularly in certificates of deposit  and an increase in fhlb advances 
the decrease in the interest rate spread was primarily the result of the decrease in the yield on investment securities and loans being greater than the decrease in the rate paid on deposits and debt 
the net interest income  on a fully taxable equivalent basis  in increased million or over the figure of million 
this increase was the result of growth in investments and interest bearing balances with banks reduced in part by a small increase in net loans  and an increase in deposits and fhlb advances 
net interest margin  a measure of net interest income performance  is determined by dividing net interest income by the average balance of total interest earning assets 
the net interest margin was for  for and for the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis was for  for and for the decrease in from in net interest margin was due to a basis point drop in average yields on interest earning assets versus a basis point decrease in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
in addition the average balance of non interest earning assets increased to million in as compared to million in the decrease in the net interest margin in compared to prior year was primarily due to the increase in non interest earning assets which were million at december  versus million at december  the interest rate spread which is the difference between interest earned on assets and the interest paid on liabilities  was  and for  and  respectively 
knbt presents its net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis because management believes that presentation of its net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis provides information that is useful for a proper understanding of the operating results of knbt s business 
these disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with gaap nor are they necessarily comparable to non gaap performance measures  which may be presented by other companies 
without the adjustment for tax free income  the net interest margin would be   and for the years ending december   and  respectively 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is determined by management s review and analysis of the loan portfolio 
this evaluation process includes  among other things  an analysis of delinquent and non performing loans  the level of charge offs and recoveries  the value of collateral securing the loan  the borrower s ability to repay  repayment performance and local economic conditions 
the valuation also takes into consideration performing loans that may have certain weaknesses as identified by management in its review of loans 
for the year ended december   knbt made a provision for loan losses of million  as compared to million for the year ended december  a primary factor in the increased provision over the comparable period was the acquisition of million of net loans from the first colonial acquisition of which commercial loans totaled million 
commercial loans and commercial real estate loans are deemed to have higher levels of known and inherent losses than one to four family residential loans due to  among other things  the nature of the collateral and the dependency on economic conditions for successful completion or operation of the project 
knbt has made provisions in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level  management believes  to the best of its knowledge  covers all known and inherent losses in the portfolio that are both probable and reasonable to estimate at this time 
the provision in was  which was prior to the first colonial merger and against a loan portfolio of predominately consisting of residential mortgage loans 
net charge offs were million  million  and  in   and  respectively 
for more information see business lending activities non performing assets in item non interest income non interest income increased in by million or to a total of million from million in the increase for over was the result of an increase of trust revenues from the company s trust services department  acquired from first colonial  of million or  a million or increase in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance boli resulting from a november purchase of an additional million of such insurance  an increase of  or in deposit service charges due to the addition of accounts from the acquisition of first colonial and a million or increase in non interest operating income  consisting primarily of higher loan fees  fees received for servicing mortgages  visa interchange fees and other fee based services 
non interest income also increased as a result of an increase in net gain on sales from investment securities of  an increase of  from sale of residential mortgage loans  and gains on sale of knbt s credit card portfolio and operations center that contributed  and  respectively  to non interest income in non interest income increased  or from million in to million in the increase in non interest income in compared with was the result of an increase of  or in fees for deposit service charges and increased fees from non interest operating income of million or 
these increases were offset by a decrease of million on net gains on sales of investment securities 
the bank securitized a portion of its mortgage portfolio which resulted in the securities gain in non interest expense non interest expense decreased to million in from million in  a million or decrease 
non interest expense for reflected a million contribution to the knbt charitable foundation in connection with the bank s conversion from mutual to stock form as well as million of merger expenses relating to the fourth quarter acquisition of first colonial 
compensation and benefit expenses increased million or for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
contributing to the increase in compensation and employee benefit expense was the addition of employees as a result of the merger with first colonial 
salaries for such employees were included for two months in compared to the full year in benefit expense for the esop  implemented in november  was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the prior year reflecting a full year of operation for the esop in net occupancy and equipment costs increased million or 
the principal factors in the higher occupancy expense were the acquisition of first colonial which added offices  extensive building renovations at the newly acquired  sq 
ft 
operations center  at knbt s headquarters and also at the former operations center of first colonial 
professional fees increased million or 
compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  an extensive review of our loan portfolio  outsourcing certain audit functions and increased services due to the growth of the company  contributed to such increase 
advertising expenses increased  or 
a concerted campaign to introduce the knbt brand in the market was the primary reason for the increase 
other operating expense increased million or primarily due to amortization of identifiable intangible assets resulting from the first colonial acquisition  which accounted for million of the increase in non interest expense in increased million or over total non interest expenses were million in and million in the pre tax contribution of million to the charitable foundation and merger expenses of million were the principal factors in the increase 
the increase in compensation and employee benefit expense from to was million or 
occupancy expenses in were million or higher than in contributing to the increase in compensation and employee benefit expense were normal salary increases  additional staff required for the new branches added in  and staff increases in the lending and trust divisions and a benefit expense of  for the esop 
income tax expense benefit knbt recorded a million income tax provision for the year ended december  compared to an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  the income tax expense in amounted to million 
the tax benefit in was the result of a net operating loss for the year 
knbt s effective federal tax rate was for the year ended december  compared to a benefit of for the year ended december  and a tax rate of for the year ended december  market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
knbt s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk  which is inherent in its lending and deposit taking activities 
to that end  management actively monitors and manages interest rate risk exposure 
in addition to market risk  knbt s primary risk is credit risk on its loan portfolio 
knbt attempts to manage credit risk through its loan underwriting and oversight policies 
see business lending activities 
the bank operates as a community banking institution primarily in the pennsylvania counties of northampton  lehigh  monroe and carbon 
as a result of the bank s location and nature of operations  knbt is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
the bank makes real estate and other loans primarily in the counties adjacent to its operations and thus is subject to risks associated with those local economies 
at december   the bank held a concentration of one to four family residential real estate loans of total loans and consumer installment loans of total loans in its loan portfolio 
loans for automobiles and other vehicles represented of the consumer installment loans and of total loans at year end the bank s loans are subject to interest and economic risks 
the bank also originates residential real estate loans for sale in the secondary market 
such loans are identified as mortgage loans held for sale on the knbt s balance sheet and are subject to interest rate risk see discussion on business loan originations  sales and servicing 
knbt does not own any trading assets and does not have any hedging transactions in place such as interest rate swaps see discussion on business investment activities 
interest rate sensitivity interest rate sensitivity is a measure of the extent to which net interest income would change due to changes in the level of interest rates 
the principal objective of knbt s interest rate risk management function is to evaluate the interest rate risk embedded in certain balance sheet accounts  determine the level of risk appropriate  given its business strategy  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with approved guidelines 
through such management  knbt seeks to minimize its exposure to interest rate risk 
an asset liability committee alco  consisting of key financial and service management personnel  meet on a monthly basis 
the alco is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity of the balance sheet  formulating and overseeing the implementation of strategies regarding interest rate risk and examining the effects on net interest income and liquidity 
knbt primarily has utilized the following strategies in its efforts to manage interest rate risk o it has emphasized originations for a portfolio of shorter term loans  particularly construction loans  commercial loans and consumer loans  o it has been an active seller in the secondary market of its newly originated  agency eligible long term fixed rate residential mortgage loans  knbt securitized an aggregate of million of single family residential mortgage loans in and million in  and o it has invested in securities with relatively short anticipated lives  generally three to five years 
gap analysis 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a bank s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset and liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
at december   knbt s cumulative one year interest rate gap  which is the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year  as a percentage of total assets  was a positive 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to affect adversely net interest income while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to affect adversely net interest income 
the following table sets forth the amounts of knbt s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which are expected  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability 
the table sets forth an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at december   on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated prepayments  and scheduled rate adjustments within a three month period and subsequent selected time intervals 
the loan amounts in the table reflect principal balances expected to be repaid and or repriced as a result of contractual amortization and anticipated prepayments of adjustable rate loans and fixed rate loans  and as a result of contractual rate adjustments on adjustable rate loans 
annual prepayment rates for adjustable rate and fixed rate single family  multi family mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities are assumed to range from to 
annual rates of withdrawal or decay rates for money market deposit accounts  savings accounts and interest bearing checking accounts are assumed to be  and  respectively 
at december  more than more than more than more than months months months year years more than or less to months to year to years to years years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets deposits at other institutions   loans receivable        investment securities  debt        investment securities  equity   total interest earning assets        cumulative total interest earning assets        interest bearing liabilities savings deposits       interest bearing checking deposits       money market deposits        certificates of deposit       fhlb advances and other borrowings        total interest bearing liabilities        cumulative total interest bearing liabilities        interest earning assets less interest bearing liabilities        cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap       cumulative interest rate gap as a percentage of total assets at december  cumulative interest earning assets as a percentage of cumulative interest bearing liabilities at december  interest earning assets are included in the period in which the balances are expected to be redeployed and or repriced as a result of anticipated prepayments  scheduled rate adjustment and contractual maturity 
for purposes of the gap analysis  loans receivable includes non performing loans  gross of the allowance for loan losses  undisbursed loan funds and deferred loan fees 
interest rate sensitivity gap represents the difference between net interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate loans may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
knbt s interest rate sensitivity is monitored by management through the use of models that generate estimates of the change in its net portfolio value npv and net interest income nii over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
the npv ratio  under any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
knbt also analyzes potential changes to nii for a twelve month period under rising and falling interest rate scenarios 
the following table sets forth knbt s npv and nii analysis as of december  and reflects the changes to npv and nii as a result of immediate and sustained changes in interest rates as indicated 
net portfolio value projected at december  net interest income for change change from from rate scenario amount base case amount base case dollars in thousands basis point rate shock   basis point rate shock   basis point rate shock   static base case   basis point rate shock   basis point rate shock   basis point rate shock   liquidity knbt s primary sources of funds are from deposits  amortization of loans  loan prepayments and the maturity of loans  mortgage backed securities and other investments  and other funds provided from operations 
while scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and mortgage backed securities and maturing investment securities are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments can be greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
knbt also maintains excess funds in short term  interest bearing assets that provide additional liquidity and also utilizes outside borrowings  primarily from the fhlb of pittsburgh  as an additional funding source 
knbt uses its liquidity to fund existing and future loan commitments  to fund maturing certificates of deposit and demand deposit withdrawals  to invest in other interest earning assets  and to meet operating expenses 
in addition to cash flow from loan and securities payments and prepayments as well as from sales of securities and mortgage loans  knbt has significant borrowing capacity available to fund liquidity needs 
knbt has increased its utilization of fhlb borrowings in recent years especially in  as a cost efficient alternative to deposits as a source of funds 
the average balance of fhlb borrowings was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
to date  knbt borrowings have consisted primarily of advances from the fhlb of pittsburgh 
conversion from mutual to stock form 
the bank completed its conversion in october in connection with the conversion  knbt sold  shares of common stock at a price of per share for total proceeds of million 
the capitalized expenses for the conversion were million resulting in net proceeds of million 
concurrent with the conversion  knbt established the keystone nazareth charitable foundation with a contribution of  shares of knbt common stock to the foundation 
also concurrent with the conversion  knbt acquired first colonial and in connection therewith issued  shares of common stock to the stockholders of first colonial in exchange for their first colonial shares 
in connection with the conversion  knbt also established the esop 
the esop purchased  shares in open market transactions at an average price of per share for a total cost of million 
at december    knbt common shares were allocated to plan participants 
a significant amount of capital was raised during the mutual to stock conversion and capital levels exceeded at year end knbt s management has developed capital management strategies to effectively utilize the excess capital and improve return on equity and grow earnings per share 
knbt s capital management strategy includes the following components payment of cash dividends  stock repurchases  acquisitions and use of leverage 
knbt declared and paid its first cash dividend in the second quarter of and also declared and paid dividends for the third and fourth quarters of during the fourth quarter of  knbt s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares or approximately of knbt s outstanding shares 
during  knbt acquired oakwood financial corp  a full service brokerage firm based in allentown  pa 
oakwood is a wholly owned subsidiary of the bank and supplements the bank s offering of investment and insurance products 
contractual obligations  commitments  contingent liabilities and off balance sheet obligations knbt has not used  and has no intention to use  any significant off balance sheet financing arrangements for liquidity purposes 
its primary financial instruments with off balance sheet risk are limited to loan servicing for others  obligations to fund loans to customers pursuant to existing commitments and commitments to sell mortgage loans 
in addition  knbt has not had  and has no intention to have  any significant transactions  arrangements or other relationships with any unconsolidated  limited purpose entities that could materially affect its liquidity or capital resources 
knbt has not  and does not intend to  trade in commodity contracts 
knbt anticipates that it will continue to have sufficient funds and alternative funding sources to meet its current commitments 
knbt s contractual cash obligations as of december  are as follows payments due by period less than more than total year years years years dollars in thousands federal home loan bank debt      subordinated debt   operating leases     severance agreements deferred directors fees and officer compensation   total obligations      knbt is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
those instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
knbt s exposure to credit loss in the event of non performance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments 
knbt uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
knbt s contingent liabilities and commitments as of december  are as follows less than more than total year years years years dollars in thousands lines of credit      standby letters of credit    other commitments to make loans      total      impact of inflation and changing prices 
the financial statements  accompanying notes  and related financial data of knbt presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of operations 
most of knbt s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  therefore  the impact of interest rates has a greater impact on its performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
leverage transactions 
several leverage transactions were completed during the year 
knbt used capital and fhlb borrowings to purchase investments 
leverage strategies generally increase the company s interest rate risk exposure and leverage transactions are carefully monitored and measured as part of active balance sheet management 
regulatory capital requirements 
knbt and the bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on knbt s financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements on december   fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment statement r replaces fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
statement r establishes standards for which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for good or services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods and services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
under statement r  all forms of share based payments to employees  including stock options  would be treated the same as other forms of compensation by recognizing the related cost in the income statement 
the expense of the award requires the entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award vesting period 
fair value of that award will be re measured subsequently at each reporting date through the settlement date 
the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments
