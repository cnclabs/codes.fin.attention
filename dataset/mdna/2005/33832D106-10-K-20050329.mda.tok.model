item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we were formed as a owned subsidiary of senior housing 
effective july   we assumed the operations of healthcare communities from two bankrupt former tenants of senior housing 
pursuant to tax laws applicable to real estate investment trusts  senior housing engaged fsq  an independent operating company formed by our managing directors  to manage these communities 
at the time we assumed operations of these communities  we had not received substantially all of the required licenses for these communities 
as a result  for the period from july  through december   we accounted for the operations of these communities using the equity method of accounting and we only recorded the net income from these operations 
thereafter  we obtained all necessary licenses to operate these communities  and on january   we began to consolidate the results of operations of these communities 
on december   senior housing distributed substantially all of our shares to its shareholders in a spin off transaction and we became a separately traded public company 
on january   in order to acquire the personnel  systems and assets necessary to operate these communities  we acquired fsq by merger 
overview of industry trends the senior living industry is experiencing growth as a result of demographic and various other factors 
according to census data  the over age population in the united states is growing much faster than the general population 
as a general rule  economic factors that affect seniors will have a corresponding impact on the senior living industry 
for example  general concerns regarding lower interest rates on savings and uncertainty of investment returns have impacted seniors during the past several years 
on the other hand  the continuing strength of the home resale market in most areas of the country has been beneficial to seniors  since the equity from the sale of a home is a significant source of funding for senior living care for many people 
in addition  overall economic conditions and general consumer confidence can impact the industry  as many adult children subsidize the cost for care of elderly parents and share in decisions regarding their care 
the independent and assisted living business is rapidly changing 
the demand for these services increased significantly beginning with the emergence of the industry segment in the mid s 
however  the development of new independent and assisted living communities across the country outstripped demand during this period  resulting in oversupply of unit capacity  longer fill up times  price pressures and deep discounting 
the growing demand for independent and assisted living services  together with minimal new development activity  reduced to some extent the oversupply in many markets in recent years 
as a result  we have been able to increase occupancy and rates 
we believe that new development will remain at sustainable levels over the next few years 
the average length of stay in independent and assisted living communities is approximately three and a half and two years  respectively  which represents a challenge and an opportunity for us 
we must find a number of new residents to maintain and build occupancy 
however  we also have the opportunity to mark to market if we are able to attract new residents at higher current market rates  replacing prior residents that had lower or discounted rates 
the skilled nursing segment is a more mature segment of the senior living industry  and has seen both demand and price increases in recent years  with little new unit capacity entering the market 
we expect this growth in demand to continue over the next several years  but with new alternatives available to seniors such as home health care and the growing independent and assisted living market  this growth in demand may be reduced and in some cases reversed 
in addition  while we have had overall medicare and medicaid rate increases over the last two years  we are not sure that future rates will increase as fast as our costs 
in fact  due to both federal and state budget shortfalls we expect in some areas that our rates may decline 
the average length of stay in nursing homes is approximately one and a half years 
we believe that many of our skilled nursing facilities benefit from significant barriers to entry from competitors  including the significant cost and length of time to develop competitive facilities  the difficulty in finding acceptable development sites in the geographical areas in which our facilities are located and some states certificate of need and license processes 
overview of five star s revenues and expenses we earn our revenues primarily by providing housing and services to our residents 
approximately of our revenues come from private pay sources  meaning that residents or their families pay from their own funds or from the proceeds of their long term care policies 
all private pay residents are billed in advance for the next month s housing and care 
our most significant expenses are wages and benefits includes wages for our employees working at our communities and wage related expenses such as health insurance  workers compensation insurance and other standard benefits 
other operating expenses includes utilities  housekeeping  dietary  maintenance  marketing  insurance and community level administrative costs 
management fee to sls management fee related to the communities sls manages for us 
rent expense we lease of our senior living communities from two entities  senior housing and hcpi 
general and administrative expenses wage related costs for headquarters and regional staff supporting our communities are the largest component of this category 
other significant items are travel  marketing and legal and professional services 
depreciation and amortization expense we incur depreciation expense on buildings and furniture and equipment 
we incur amortization expense related to costs associated with our revolving credit facility and other debt 
interest expense interest on outstanding balances on our revolving credit facility as well as other debt

the increase in revenues from our two pharmacies is a result of our acquiring these pharmacies during the third quarters of and our increase in wages and benefits costs is primarily due to wage increases as well as wages related to the three communities we began to operate in may  one community we began to operate in may and the communities we acquired in november the increase in other operating expenses  which include utilities  housekeeping  dietary  maintenance  insurance and community level administrative costs is primarily a result of increased charges from third parties  our operation of three additional communities beginning in may  one community we began to operate in may  and our communities acquired in november the operating expenses for the communities that we have operated continuously since january  have increased by principally due to wage and benefit increases 
the increase in pharmacy expenses is a result of our acquiring these pharmacies during the third quarters of and management fees related to the communities that sls manages for us increased by because of the increased revenues at these communities and a contractual increase in the effective management fee calculation 
the rent expense increase is due to the addition of communities that we began to lease in and  and our payment of additional rent for capital improvements which were funded by senior housing since january  the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  is primarily due to costs resulting from our increased operations  as well as increases in wages and benefits for our corporate and regional staff 
the increase in depreciation expense for the year ended december  is primarily attributable to our purchase of furniture and fixtures related to the communities managed by sls and our acquisition of communities as a result of the lta acquisition in november  offset by our sale of seven communities in our interest and other income increased by million primarily due to the amounts received in connection with our january settlement with marriott and msls  whereby we and senior housing were each paid million 
under the terms of the settlement  we and senior housing  and marriott and msls  agreed to dismiss all claims and counterclaims asserted in the litigation 
we accrued  for federal alternative minimum income taxes during the year ended december  this provision was not required for the year ended december  there is no provision for regular income taxes because we have net operating loss carry forwards 
loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december  was  compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily the result of our ceasing operations at one property in compared with our ceasing operations at seven properties in year ended december  versus year ended december  the following tables present an overview of our portfolio for the years ended december  and variance change net revenues from residents in s pharmacy revenue in s wages and benefits in s other operating expenses in s pharmacy expenses in s management fee to sls in s rent expense in s general and administrative in s depreciation and amortization in s interest and other income in s interest expense in s loss from discontinued operations in s no

the pharmacy revenue increase is a result of our acquiring a pharmacy during the third quarter of the increase in revenues from medicare and medicaid is a result of our higher medicare census throughout our increase in wages and benefits costs is primarily due to expenses at the communities we began to operate since october  as well as increases in workers compensation and employee health insurance costs 
the increase in other operating expenses  which include utilities  housekeeping  dietary  maintenance  insurance and community level administrative costs is primarily due to the expenses at the communities we began to operate since october  as well as higher professional and general liability insurance costs 
the operating expenses for the communities that we have operated continuously since january  have increased by primarily due to increases in employee health  workers compensation and professional and general liability insurance costs 
the pharmacy expenses are a result of our acquiring a pharmacy during the third quarter of management fees related to the communities managed for us by sls increased by  primarily because these arrangements commenced on january   therefore  includes more days than rent expense to senior housing increased by  primarily due to rents for communities we began to lease since october  and rent increases which resulted from senior housing s purchase of improvements at leased communities  partially offset by a lease modification entered into in october which changed the ownership of certain ff e reserve escrows 
the increase in our general and administrative expenses is primarily due to costs resulting from our increased operations and to legal costs incurred in connection with our litigation with marriott and msls which was settled in january the million increase in depreciation expense is attributable to our purchase of seven communities in  as well as to capitalized improvements to some of our communities which increased our depreciable assets 
the  decrease in interest and other income is due to lower cash balances and lower interest rates in  partially offset by interest earned on mortgage notes receivable 
the million decrease in the loss from discontinued operations is primarily attributable to our dispositions of these operations in  as well as the recovery of some accounts receivable that were previously written off 
liquidity and capital resources our current assets at december  were million  compared to million at december  this increase is primarily attributable to our acquisition of lta in november  and our equity offering in december at december  and  we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
our current liabilities were million at december   compared to million at december  in  information became available to us which resulted in our recording million of additional paid in capital 
this amount was the result of our having received more working capital assets and our having assumed fewer liabilities than we had previously recorded at the time of our spin off from senior housing 
we lease communities from senior housing under four leases 
our leases with senior housing require us to pay minimum rent of million annually and percentage rent beginning in we believe we are in compliance with the terms of our leases with senior housing 
our revenues from services to residents at our communities is the primary source of cash to fund operating expenses  including rent  principal and interest payments on our debt and capital expenditures 
at some of our communities  operating revenues for nursing home services are received from the medicare and medicaid programs 
for each of and  of our total revenues were derived from these programs 
medicare and medicaid revenues were earned primarily from the nursing homes we lease from senior housing 
since  the pps has generally lowered medicare rates paid to senior living communities  including many that we operate 
in october and  medicare rates increased by approximately and  respectively 
our medicare revenues totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our medicaid revenues totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
some of the states in which we operate have not raised rates by amounts sufficient to offset increasing costs or are expected to reduce medicaid funding 
the magnitude of the potential medicaid rate reductions cannot currently be estimated  but it may be material and may affect our future results of operations 
further medicare and medicaid rate declines may have a dramatic negative impact on our revenues and may produce losses 
recent increases in the costs of insurance  especially tort liability insurance  workers compensation and employee health insurance  which are affecting the senior living industry  may continue to have an adverse impact upon our future results of operations 
also  we believe marriott s sale of its senior living management business to sunrise has had  and may continue to have  an adverse impact on our financial results 
also  prior to july  pursuant to existing contract terms  a portion of our management fees payable to sls were conditional  based on exceeding a threshold of net operating income that was not achieved and  therefore  was not being paid 
as of july  this portion of the management fee is no longer conditional and we are now required to pay the full fee 
we expect the annual amount of this additional management fee to be approximately million per year 
we expect improvements in our operations will offset this increased cost  but our efforts in this regard may not be successful 
our revolving credit facility limits our ability to incur debt as more fully described below in debt instruments and covenants 
the terms of our leases with senior housing contain provisions whereby senior housing may cancel our rights under these agreements upon the acquisition by any person or group of more than of our voting stock  and upon other change of control events 
these leases also limit our ability to create  incur  assume or guarantee indebtedness 
in august  we sold a community in bloomfield  connecticut for million  million of which was paid in the form of a promissory note from the purchaser secured by a mortgage on that property 
this note is payable in monthly installments of  of principal  plus interest which accrues on the unpaid principal balance at a rate of per year 
this note matures on august   but we have the right to require prepayment as of august  in december  we sold five group homes in maryland for million  million of which was paid in the form of a promissory note from the purchaser secured by a mortgage on those five properties 
this note is payable in monthly installments of  of principal  plus interest which accrues on the unpaid principal balance at a rate of 
this note matures on november   but we have the right to require prepayment earlier by giving notice after november  during  senior housing agreed to sell us two nursing homes in michigan that we leased from senior housing 
the purchase price is million  the appraised value of the properties 
on april   we purchased one of these properties from senior housing for million 
we financed this acquisition with million of proceeds we received from a new hud insured mortgage and by using cash on hand 
we expect the second purchase to occur during and we intend to finance the second sale with proceeds that we receive from a second hud insured mortgage and with available cash 
the second property is currently leased from senior housing on a combined basis with other properties 
under the terms of our lease with senior housing  upon completion of the sale  the annual rent payable under the combined lease will be reduced by of the sale prices we pay to senior housing 
in november  we acquired of the capital stock of lta for approximately million  excluding closing costs 
to finance this acquisition  we entered into a million sale leaseback transaction with senior housing for of the communities acquired from lta 
we also entered a million mortgage loan with senior housing secured by five of our properties 
we funded the balance of the purchase price with cash on hand and by assuming hud insured long term mortgage debt and an operating lease for four communities from hcpi 
in december and january  we issued a total of  common shares for net proceeds in the amount of million 
a portion of proceeds raised in this offering were used to pay off the million mortgage loan with senior housing described above 
on january   we agreed to purchase six assisted living communities for approximately million from gordon 
we intend to finance this acquisition with cash on hand  borrowings under our line of credit and mortgage or sale leaseback transactions for some of the communities being purchased or for certain othe r communities which we currently own 
completion of this acquisition is subject to various conditions customary in multi community healthcare transactions of this type  including completion of diligence  licensing and receiving third party consents 
we expect this acquisition to close during the second quarter of  but there is no assurance that it will close 
we will be required to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  or section  for our fiscal year ending december  if our public float exceeds million as of june   or in any event for our fiscal year ending december  based on the closing price of our stock on march   our public float was million 
as such  we have commenced our plan for complying with section and are currently in the process of documenting our processes and controls 
we expect to devote substantial time and effort and incur substantial costs in complying with section in fiscal year and beyond 
despite the commitments  contingencies and limitations described above  we believe that a combination of our efforts to increase revenues and contain costs  our ability to borrow on our revolving credit facility  our ability to sell to senior housing certain capital improvements made to communities leased from senior housing and the possibility of sales or financings of our owned communities will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs  operating expenses  rent payments to senior housing  debt service and capital expenditures for the next months and the foreseeable future 
as of december   our contractual obligations were as follows dollars in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet under gaap total these amounts represent amounts due under several hud insured mortgages 
these amounts represent minimum lease payments through and it does not include percentage rent that may be payable under these leases 
this amount represents our obligation to purchase a property from senior housing 
this obligation is contingent upon our receiving hud insured financing for a significant part of this purchase price 
these amounts include liabilities for continuing care contracts which require residents to make advance payments  some of which are refundable and continuously carried as liabilities and some of which are not refundable and are carried as liabilities until they are recognized as revenues over the periods during which we expect to provide the service 
these amounts also include insurance reserves related to workers compensation and professional liability insurance as well as deferred gains related to property sales 
debt instruments and covenants in october  we entered into a revolving credit facility 
the interest rate on borrowings on this facility is libor plus a spread 
the maximum amount available under this facility is million  and is subject to limitations based upon qualifying collateral 
the borrower under this facility is a subsidiary that we organized with the intention that it be bankruptcy remote 
certain of our other subsidiaries sell or contribute their accounts receivable to the borrower on a true sale basis and make certain representations and other undertakings in favor of the borrower in connection with each sale 
the seller subsidiaries have granted security interests in their assets to secure their obligations to the borrower 
we guarantee the obligations of the seller subsidiaries obligations to the borrower subsidiary and have pledged the stock or membership interests in each of the seller subsidiaries to the borrower 
the borrower has in turn collaterally assigned these undertakings  guarantees and collateral to the revolving credit facility lenders  and has granted a security interest in the purchased receivables and all of its other assets to secure its obligations under the facility 
the facility is available for acquisitions  working capital and general business purposes 
the facility contains covenants and events of default requiring the maintenance of collateral  minimum net worth and certain other financial ratios  and places limits on our ability to incur or assume debt or create liens with respect to certain of our properties  and other customary provisions 
the accounts receivable collateralizing the facility totaled million as of december  in certain circumstances and subject to available collateral and lender approvals  the maximum amounts which we may draw under this credit agreement may be increased to million 
the termination date of the facility is october  as of december   no amounts were outstanding under the facility 
at march   we believe we are in compliance with all applicable covenants under this revolving credit agreement and no amounts were outstanding under the facility 
we have begun negotiations with a bank concerning a substitute credit facility to become effective before our current credit facility expires  however  we can provide no assurance that these negotiations will be successfully concluded 
on april   we purchased a property from senior housing for million 
we financed this acquisition with million in proceeds we received from a hud insured mortgage and with cash on hand 
the interest cost on this debt is per year 
principal and interest is due monthly through april this mortgage contains standard hud mortgage covenants 
at march   we believe we are in compliance with all material covenants of this mortgage 
as part of our recent lta acquisition  we assumed million of hud insured mortgage debt 
the interest cost on this debt is a weighted average rate of per year 
principal and interest is due monthly through varying dates ranging from february to june mortgage premiums totaling million were recorded in accounting for the acquisition of the mortgaged properties in order to record the assumed mortgages at their estimated fair value 
the mortgage premiums will be amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the period the mortgages remain outstanding 
these mortgages are secured by seven of our communities and contain standard hud mortgage covenants 
at march   we believe we are in compliance with all material covenants of these mortgages 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s k  item a iii 
related party transactions on december   senior housing distributed substantially all of its ownership of our shares to its shareholders 
in order to effect this spin off and to govern relations after the spin off  we entered into agreements with senior housing  pursuant to which it was agreed  among other things  that so long as senior housing remains a real estate investment trust  or a reit  we may not waive the share ownership restrictions in our charter on the ability of any person or group to acquire more than of any class of our equity shares without  among other requirements  the consent of senior housing and our determination that the exception to the ownership limitations would not cause a default under any of our leases  so long as we are a tenant of senior housing  we will neither permit any person or group to acquire more than of any class of our voting stock or permit the occurrence of other change in control events  as defined  nor will we take any action that  in the reasonable judgment of senior housing or hrpt properties trust another reit which owns shares of senior housing  or hrpt  might jeopardize the tax status of senior housing or hrpt as reits  senior housing has the option  upon the acquisition by a person or group of more than of our voting stock and upon other change in control events  as defined  to cancel all of our rights under the leases we have with senior housing  and so long as we maintain our shared services agreement with rmr  we will not acquire or finance any real estate without first giving senior housing  hrpt or any other publicly owned reit or other entity managed by rmr  the opportunity to acquire or finance real estate investments of the type in which senior housing  hrpt or any other publicly owned reit or other entity managed by rmr  respectively  invest 
at the time of our spin off from senior housing  all of the persons serving as our directors were trustees of senior housing 
our two managing directors  messrs 
martin and portnoy  are currently the managing trustees of senior housing 
of the senior living communities we currently operate  are leased from senior housing for total annual minimum rent of million 
during  we and senior housing were jointly involved in litigation with marriott  the operator of the senior living communities which we leased from senior housing 
we and senior housing equally shared the costs of this litigation 
this litigation was settled in january since january   we have entered into or agreed to enter into multiple transactions with senior housing  including the following on march   senior housing purchased from us one independent and assisted living community with units located in maryland 
the purchase price was million  the appraised value of the property 
simultaneous with this purchase  our existing leases with senior housing were modified as follows the lease for nursing homes and the lease for independent and assisted living communities were combined into one lease and the property acquired on march  was added to this combined lease  the combined lease maturity date was changed to december  from december  and for the separate leases  our minimum rent for the combined lease of nursing homes and independent living communities was increased by million  for all of our leases with senior housing  the amount of additional rent to be paid to senior housing was changed to of the increase in revenues at the leased properties beginning in prior to the lease combination  the percentage and the beginning time period for the nursing home lease and the independent and assisted living community lease was in and in  respectively  and all other lease terms remain substantially unchanged 
in  senior housing evicted a nursing home tenant that had defaulted on its obligations to senior housing 
until may  we managed this nursing home for senior housing s account 
effective on may   we agreed with senior housing to add this nursing home to a multi property lease from senior housing and to increase the annual rent by  all other lease terms remained unchanged 
one of the properties we lease from senior housing was subject to a ground lease from an unaffiliated third party 
we were responsible for paying the ground rent of  per year 
on june   senior housing exercised an option to purchase this land for million and acquired the landlord s rights and obligations under the ground lease 
we now pay the ground rent to senior housing 
on november   senior housing loaned us million in connection with our acquisition of lta 
such loan was repaid on november  with the proceeds we received from a million sale leaseback with senior housing for of the acquired communities and a million mortgage loan from senior housing secured by five of our communities 
this mortgage was repaid in december during  pursuant to the terms of our leases with senior housing  we sold to senior housing million of improvements we had made to its properties  and our annual rent payable to senior housing was increased by of senior housing s purchase price  or  we obtained a workers compensation insurance policy for the year beginning june   from a third party insurer 
this third party insurer ceded a portion of the premiums we paid to a bermuda based company  affiliates insurers  limited  or affiliates  which was owned by rmr 
affiliates was organized by rmr to assist us in creating a partial self insurance program on an expedited basis 
on december   we acquired affiliates from rmr for an amount equal to rmr s cost of organizing and capitalizing that company  approximately million 
our chief executive officer and chief financial officer are also officers and employees of rmr 
these officers devote a substantial majority of their business time to our affairs and the remainder to rmr s business which is separate from our business 
we believe the compensation we pay to these officers reasonably reflects their division of business time  however  periodically  these individuals may divide their business time differently than they do currently and their compensation from us may become disproportionate to this division 
rmr provides management and administrative services to us under a shared services agreement 
rmr is compensated at an annual rate equal to of our total revenues 
aggregate fees earned by rmr for services during  and  were million  million and million  respectively 
rmr also provides the internal audit function for us and for other publicly owned companies to which it provides management services 
we pay a pro rata share of rmr s costs in providing that function 
our audit committee approves the identity and salary of the individual serving as our director of internal audit  as well as the pro rata share of the costs which we pay 
the fact that rmr has responsibilities to other entities  including one of our landlords  senior housing  could create conflicts  and in the event of such conflicts between senior housing and us  the shared services agreement allows rmr to act on behalf of senior housing rather than on our behalf 
rmr is owned by messrs 
martin and portnoy who are our managing directors 
messrs 
martin and portnoy each have material interests in the transactions between us and rmr described above 
all transactions between us and rmr are approved by our independent directors 
our compensation committee has approved the renewal of the shared services agreement for its current term which will end december  messrs 
martin and portnoy own the building in which our headquarters is located 
our lease for space was originally executed by fsq 
this lease expires in we paid rent  which includes our proportional share of utilities and real estate taxes  under this lease during  and of   and  respectively 
until march   mr 
portnoy was a partner of sullivan worcester llp  our counsel and counsel to senior housing  rmr and affiliates of each of the foregoing  and he received payments from that firm during  and in respect of his retirement 
wells fargo company beneficially owns of our common shares 
wells fargo bank  na  an affiliate of wells fargo company  became the transfer agent and registrar for our common shares  effective as of december  critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies concern revenue recognition  our assessment of the net realizable value of our accounts receivable  the realizable value of long term assets  accounting for long term care contracts  accounting for business combinations and our assessment of reserves related to our self insurance programs 
our revenue recognition policies involve judgments about medicare and medicaid rate calculation methodologies 
these judgments are based principally upon our experience with these programs and our knowledge and familiarity with the current rules and regulations of these programs 
we recognize revenues when services are provided and these amounts are reported at their estimated net realizable amounts 
some medicare and medicaid revenues are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment 
our policies for valuing accounts receivable involve significant judgments based upon our experience  including consideration of the age of the receivable  the terms of the agreements with our residents or their third party payors  the resident or payors stated intent to pay  the resident or payors financial capacity and other factors which may include litigation or appeal proceedings 
we monitor our long term assets to determine whether any impairment of these assets may have occurred 
if the facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred  we evaluate the asset s carrying value to determine whether an impairment charge is required 
this process includes a review of historical and projected future financial results realized or to be realized from the affected assets  market conditions affecting the sale of similar assets and the like 
this process requires that estimates be made and errors in our judgments or estimates could have a material effect on our financial statements 
at certain of our communities  we offer long term care contracts under which residents pay a one time deposit in exchange for reduced charges during their stay 
the one time deposits may be refundable or non refundable  or partially refundable and partially non refundable 
we record such deposits as a long term obligation and amortize the non refundable portion of such deposits into revenue over our estimate of the periods during which future services will be provided 
we base these estimates on our experience and actuarial information 
since we became a separate public company  each of our acquisitions has been accounted for as a purchase business combination in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
purchase accounting requires that we make certain judgments and estimates based on our experience  including determining the fair value and useful lives of assets acquired and the fair value of liabilities assumed 
some of our judgments and estimates are also based upon published industry statistics and in some cases third party appraisals 
our critical accounting policies for determining reserves for the self funded part of our insurance programs and for our self insurance programs involve significant judgments based upon our experience  including projected settlements for pending claims  known incidents which we expect may result in claims  estimates of incurred but not yet reported claims and incidents  claims experience  estimated litigation costs and other factors 
we also periodically receive and rely upon recommendations from professional consultants in establishing these reserves 
in the future we may need to revise the judgments  estimates and assessments we use to formulate our critical accounting policies to incorporate information which is not now known 
we cannot predict the effect changes to these premises underlying our critical accounting policies may have on our future results of operations  although such changes could be material and adverse 
inflation and deflation inflation in the past several years in the us has been modest 
future inflation might have both positive or negative impacts on our business 
rising price levels may allow us to increase occupancy charges to residents  but may also cause our operating costs  including our percentage rent  to increase 
also our ability to increase rates paid by medicare and medicaid will be limited despite inflation 
deflation would likely have a negative impact upon us 
a large component of our expenses consist of minimum rental obligations to senior housing 
accordingly we believe that a general decline in price levels which could cause our charges to residents to decline would likely not be fully offset by a decline in our expenses 
seasonality our business is subject to modest effects of seasonality 
during the calendar fourth quarter holiday periods nursing home and assisted living residents are sometimes discharged to join family celebrations and admission decisions are often deferred 
the first quarter of each calendar year usually coincides with increased illness among nursing home and assisted living residents which can result in increased costs or discharges to hospitals 
as a result of these factors  nursing home and assisted living operations sometimes produce greater earnings in the second and third quarters of a calendar year and lesser earnings in the first and fourth quarters 
we do not believe that this seasonality will cause fluctuations in our revenues or operating cash flow to such an extent that we will have difficulty paying our expenses  including rent  which do not fluctuate seasonally 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates 
we manage our exposure to this market risk through our monitoring of available financing alternatives 
other than as described below we do not now anticipate any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage this risk in the future 
changes in market interest rates also affect the fair value of our debt obligations  increases in market interest rates decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt  while decreases in market interest rates increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
for example based upon discounted cash flow analysis  if prevailing interest rates were to decline by and other credit market considerations remained unchanged  the market value of our million mortgage debt outstanding on december   would increase by about million  and  similarly  if prevailing interest rates were to increase by  the market value of our million mortgage debt would decline by about million 
our revolving credit facility bears interest at floating rates and matures in october as of december   we had no amounts outstanding under this revolving credit facility 
we borrow in us dollars and borrowings under our revolving credit facility are subject to interest at libor plus a spread 
accordingly  we are vulnerable to changes in us dollar based short term rates  specifically libor 
a change in interest rates would not affect the value of any outstanding floating rate debt but would affect our operating results 
for example  if the maximum amount of our credit facility of million were drawn and interest rates decrease or increase by per annum  our interest expense would decrease or increase by  per year  or per share  based on currently outstanding common shares  respectively 
if interest rates were to change gradually over time  the impact would be spread over time 
our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates may increase in the future if we incur debt to fund acquisitions or otherwise 
as of march   we have no commercial paper  derivatives  swaps  hedges  joint ventures or partnerships
