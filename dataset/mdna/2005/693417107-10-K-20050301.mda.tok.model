item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this report on form k contains forward looking statements within the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  including statements regarding our expectations  hopes  intentions  beliefs or strategies regarding the future 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements for the reasons noted under the sub heading factors that may affect future operating results and in other sections of this report on form k 
all forward looking statements included in this form k are based on information available to us on the date of this report on form k  and we assume no obligation to update the forward looking statements  or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in the forward looking statements 
see factors that may affect future operating results below  as well as such other risks and uncertainties as are detailed in our securities and exchange commission reports and filings for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview plx was founded in  and between and we focused on development of i o interface semiconductors and related software and development tools that are used in systems incorporating the pci standard 
in  we shifted the majority of our development efforts to pci express 
in and  a significant portion of our revenues were derived from the sale of semiconductor devices that perform similar functions as our current products  except they were based on a variety of industry standards 
our revenues since have been derived predominantly from the sale of semiconductor devices based on the pci standard to a large number of customers in a variety of applications including networking and telecommunications  enterprise storage  imaging  industrial and other embedded applications as well as in related adapter cards 
we generate less than of our revenues from sales of our software and development tools 
in may  we acquired hint corp 
which markets and sells pci bridges and pci x products into a variety of applications including networking and telecommunications  personal computer peripheral  imaging  industrial and other embedded applications 
beginning with the quarter ended june   our operating results include results of hint corp 
and its products 
in may  we acquired netchip technology  inc which markets and sells usb device controllers used in a range of business and consumer applications  including printers  wireless lan adapters  personal video recorders  and digital camcorders 
beginning with the quarter ended june   our operating results include results of netchip technology  inc and its products 
also  in september  we began shipping products based on the pci express standard for next generation systems 
we utilize a fabless semiconductor business model whereby we purchase wafers and packaged and tested semiconductor devices from independent manufacturing foundries 
this approach allows us to focus on defining  developing  and marketing our products and eliminates the need for us to invest large amounts of capital in manufacturing facilities and work in process inventory 
we rely on a combination of direct sales personnel and distributors and manufacturers representatives throughout the world to sell a significant portion of our products 
we pay manufacturers representatives a commission on sales while we sell products to distributors at a discount from the selling price 
we generally recognize revenue at the time of title passage 
recognition of sales to distributors  including international distributors  is deferred until the product is resold by the distributors to their customers 
see certain factors that may affect future operating results a large portion of our revenues is derived from sales to third party distributors who may terminate their relationships with us at any time 
our gross margins have fluctuated in the past and are expected to fluctuate in the future due to changes in product and customer mix  write downs and recoveries of excess or obsolete inventory  the position of our products in their respective life cycles  and specific product manufacturing costs 
the time period between initial customer evaluation and design completion can range from six to twelve months or more 
furthermore  there is typically an additional six to twelve month or greater period after design completion before a customer requests volume production of our products 
due to the variability and length of these design cycles and variable demand from customers  we may experience significant fluctuations in new orders from month to month 
in addition  we typically make inventory purchases prior to receiving customer orders 
consequently  if anticipated sales and shipments in any quarter do not occur when expected  expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and our results for that quarter and potentially future quarters would be materially and adversely affected 
our long term success will depend on our ability to introduce new products 
while new products typically generate little or no revenues during the first twelve months following their introduction  our revenues in subsequent periods depend upon these new products 
due to the lengthy sales cycle and additional time before our customers request volume production  significant revenues from our new products typically occur twelve to twenty four months after product introduction 
as a result  revenues from newly introduced products have  in the past  produced a small percentage of our total revenues in the year the product was introduced 
see certain factors that may affect future operating results our lengthy sales cycle can result in uncertainty and delays with regard to our expected revenues 
results of operations the following table summarizes historical results of operations as a percentage of net revenues for the periods shown 
year s ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative in process research and development amortization of purchased intangible assets total operating expenses operating loss interest income and other  net loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net loss comparison of years ended december    and net revenues 
net revenues consist of product revenues generated principally by sales of our semiconductor devices 
net revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million or from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to sales of our usb products acquired as part of the netchip technology  inc acquisition which was completed in may  as well as higher unit shipments of pci products 
for the twelve months ended december  usb product sales accounted for approximately million or of our total net revenues 
our usb products are characterized by relatively fast customer design cycles  relatively fast product ramps and relatively short customer product life cycles 
these factors may result in a greater degree of revenue fluctuation from usb products as compared to our pci business 
for the year ended december   approximately of net revenue was derived from sales to one distributor 
no other distributor or direct customer represented greater than of net revenues 
net revenues for the year ended december  increased by million or to million from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to revenues generated from the pci bridge product acquired as part of the hint corp 
acquisition which was completed in may for the year ended december   approximately of net revenue was derived from sales to two distributors 
no other distributor or direct customer represented greater than of net revenues 
customer demand for semiconductors can change quickly and unexpectedly 
our revenue levels have been highly dependent on the amount of new orders that are received for product to be delivered to the customer within the same quarter  also called turns fill orders 
approximately of our total revenues in were generated from turns fill orders 
because of the long cycle time to build our products  our lack of visibility into demand when turns fill is high makes it difficult to predict what product to build to match future demand 
we believe the current high turns fill requirements will continue until lead times substantially increase and order backlog grows 
however  the sustainability of improved customer demand is uncertain and highly dependent on economic conditions 
the high turns fill requirement together with the uncertainty of product mix and pricing  make it difficult to predict future levels of sales and profitability and may require us to carry higher levels of inventory 
gross margin 
gross margin represents net revenues less the cost of revenues 
cost of revenues primarily includes the cost of purchasing semiconductor devices from our independent foundries  packaging  assembly and testing costs  and costs associated with the procurement  storage and shipment of products 
gross margin for the year ended december  increased by  or million  to million for from million for the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to the shipments of usb products acquired as part of the netchip technology  inc acquisition beginning in may as well as higher units shipments of pci products 
the decrease in gross margin to for from for was primarily due to shipments of lower margin products acquired as part of the netchip acquisition 
excluding the effect of selling previously written down inventory of million and million  respectively  gross margin was for  as compared with for the decrease in our gross margin percentage was primarily due to an expected change in our product and customer mix associated with the acquisition of netchip 
gross margin for the year ended december  increased by  or million  to million for from million for the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to the shipments of pci bridge products acquired as part of the hint corp 
acquisition beginning in may as well as the sale of previously written down inventory 
the increase in gross margin to for from for was primarily related to the effect of the sale of previously written down inventory of approximately million in excluding the effect of selling previously written down inventory  gross margin was for  as compared with for the increase in our gross margin percentage was primarily due to shifts in our product and customer mix 
research and development expenses 
research and development r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in research  design  and development activities 
in addition  expenses for outside engineering consultants  non recurring engineering at our independent foundries  and deferred stock compensation are included in r d expenses 
r d as a percent of net revenues decreased to for the year ended december  as compared to for the same period in the percentage decrease is due primarily to an increase in net revenues 
in absolute dollars  r d expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in excluding deferred stock compensation of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  r d increased by million to million for from million for the increase in r d was primarily due to an increase of approximately million in compensation and benefit expenses as a result of higher headcount from the netchip acquisition  and an increase in engineering tools expense of approximately million associated with the development of new products and enhancement of existing products 
r d as a percent of net revenues decreased to for  as compared to for the percentage decrease is due primarily to an increase in net revenues 
in absolute dollars  r d expenses increased to million for from million for excluding deferred stock compensation of million and million for the years end december  and  respectively  r d increased by million to million for from million for the increase in r d was primarily due to an increase of approximately million in compensation and benefit expenses as a result of higher headcount associated with the acquisition of hint  an increase of approximately million in consulting expenses  and an increase of approximately million in engineering tools expense associated with the development of new products and enhancement of existing products 
we believe continued spending on research and development to develop new products is critical to our success and  consequently  expect to increase research and development expenses in future periods 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in selling and administrative activities  professional fees  trade show and other promotional expenses  as well as sales commissions to manufacturers representatives 
sg a as a percent of net revenues decreased to for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  the percentage decrease is due primarily to an increase in net revenues 
in absolute dollars  sg a expenses increased by million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase in sg a was due primarily to higher compensation and benefit expenses of approximately million resulting mainly from higher headcount in connection with acquisitions  higher consulting and professional fees of million due in part to our sarbanes oxley compliance effort  and an increase of approximately million in sales commissions to manufacturer s representatives as a result of higher revenues 
sg a as a percent of net revenues decreased to for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  in absolute dollars  sg a expenses increased by million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase was primarily due to an increase of approximately million in higher compensation and benefit expenses as a result of higher headcount  an increase of approximately million in professional services  an increase of approximately million in marketing expenses  and an increase in office lease expense of approximately million resulting from the assumption of the hint corp 
office lease and the loss of a subtenant 
in process research and development 
the amounts expensed to in process research and development for the year ended december  related to the acquisition of netchip technology  inc the acquired in process research and development expense of million was determined by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established and no alternative future uses existed 
plx acquired technology consisting of pci express solutions 
the value was determined by estimating the expected cash flows from the project once commercially viable  discounting the net cash flows to their present value  and then applying a percentage of completion to the calculated value as defined below 
net cash flows 
the net cash flows from the identified project utilized were based on estimates of revenues  cost of sales  research and development costs  selling  general and administrative costs  and income taxes from the project 
these estimates were based on assumptions mentioned below 
the research and development costs excluded costs to bring the acquired in process project to technological feasibility 
the estimated revenues were based on management projections of the acquired in process project 
discount rate 
discounting the net cash flows back to their present value was based on the cost of capital for well managed venture capital funds which typically have similar risks and returns on investments 
the cost of capital used in discounting the net cash flows from acquired in process technology was 
percentage of completion 
percentage of completion was determined by using costs incurred by netchip technology  inc prior to the acquisition date compared to the remaining research and development to be completed to bring the project to technological feasibility 
the company estimated that  as of the acquisition date  the project was approximately complete 
as of february  the project was substantially complete 
amortization of purchased intangible assets 
amortization of purchased intangible assets increased by million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase is due primarily to additional amortization expense from developed core technology and customer base acquired as a result of the netchip technology  inc acquisition in may and the hint corp 
acquisition in may see note to the consolidated financial statements 
amortization of purchased intangible assets increased by million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in in  the increase was due to additional amortization expense from developed core technology and customer base acquired as a result of the hint corp 
acquisition in may deferred stock compensation 
we recorded deferred compensation of million related to unvested stock options assumed in connection with the acquisition of netchip technology  inc in may we recorded deferred compensation of million related to unvested stock options assumed in connection with the acquisition of hint corp in may unamortized deferred compensation is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and is amortized ratably over the vesting period of the applicable stock grants 
amortization of deferred compensation recorded in   and  was million  million  and million  respectively 
the million decrease in deferred compensation from to is primarily the result of certain stock options becoming fully vested 
substantially all of these amounts are included in research and development expenses 
based on the current level of deferred compensation  we expect to record deferred compensation expenses of approximately million  million  million  and  for    and  respectively 
interest income 
interest income reflects interest earned on average cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investment balances 
interest income remained flat at million for and interest income decreased to million in from million for this decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates 
other income  net 
other income  net  decreased to  for from million for the decrease is due primarily to the realization of income from a non refundable lease deposit in provision for income taxes 
income tax expense for the period ended december  was million on a pretax loss of million  compared to income tax expense of  on pretax loss of million and income tax expense of  on pretax loss of million for the periods ended december  and  respectively 
our income tax expense differs from the expected benefit derived by applying the applicable us federal statutory rate to the loss from operations primarily due to the write off of in process research and development  non deductible amortization of deferred stock compensation and the impact of purchase accounting 
our income tax expense differs from the expected benefit derived by applying the applicable us federal statutory rate to the loss from operations primarily due to non deductible amortization of deferred compensation and the write off of in process research and development 
our income tax expense differs from the expected benefit derived by applying the applicable us federal statutory rate to the loss from operations primarily due to non deductible charges for the amortization of deferred compensation and the recording of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset partially offset by the benefit of research and development tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments were million at december   an increase of million from million at december  the increase was primarily due to the following a net loss of million adjusted for non cash expenses of million  an increase in accounts payable of million  a decrease in accounts receivable of million  cash acquired in the acquisition of netchip of million  and cash received from the exercise of stock options of million 
this was partially offset by an increase in inventory of million  a decrease in other accrued expenses of million  and capital expenditures of million 
in september  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of common stock 
at the discretion of the management  we can repurchase the shares from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
approximately  shares had been repurchased for approximately million in cash in we did not repurchase any shares during we believe that our existing resources  together with cash generated from our operations will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the inventory levels we maintain  the level of investment we make in new technologies and improvements to existing technologies and the levels of monthly expenses required to launch new products 
from time to time  we may also evaluate potential acquisitions and equity investments complementary to our technologies and market strategies 
to the extent that existing resources and future earnings are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings 
additional funds may not be available or  if available  we may not be able to obtain them on terms favorable to us and our stockholders 
as of december   we had the following significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments in thousands payments due in and total thereafter operating leases facilities and equipment 
software licenses  inventory purchase commitments   total cash obligations   see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the sec has defined a company s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below 
we also have other key accounting policies which involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results 
for additional information see note organization and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
although we believe that our estimates  assumptions and judgments are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
inventory write downs 
we evaluate the need for potential write downs of inventory by considering a combination of factors 
based on the life of the product  sales history  obsolescence  and sales forecast  we may record write downs to our inventory ranging from to 
any adverse changes to our future product demand may result in increased write downs  resulting in decreased gross margin 
in addition  future sales on any of our previously written down inventory may result in increased gross margin in the period of sale 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on length of time the receivables are past due 
we record reserves for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
we have certain customers with individually large amounts due at any given balance sheet date 
any unanticipated change in one of those customer s creditworthiness or other matters affecting the collectibility of amounts due from such customers could have a material affect on our results of operations in the period in which such changes or events occur 
goodwill 
we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist 
although at december   no impairment of goodwill has been recognized  it is reasonably possible that assumptions upon which the recoverability of goodwill were based could differ in the future 
in that event  impairment charges could be required 
taxes 
we account for income taxes using the liability method 
deferred taxes are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
as of december   we carried a valuation allowance for the entire deferred tax asset as a result of uncertainties regarding the realization of the asset balance see note to the consolidated financial statements 
future taxable income and or tax planning strategies may eliminate all or a portion of the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event we determine we are able to realize our deferred tax asset  an adjustment to the valuation allowance may increase income in the period such determination is made 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the fasb issued eitf issue no 
eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments which provided new guidance for assessing impairment losses on investments 
additionally  eitf includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb delayed the accounting provisions of eitf  however the disclosure requirements remain effective for annual periods ending after june  the adoption of this requirement did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operation 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r which requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of income 
the accounting provisions of sfas r are effective for reporting periods beginning after june  we are required to adopt sfas r in the third quarter of fiscal the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
see stock based compensation note of the consolidated financial statements for the pro forma net income and net income per share amounts  for fiscal through fiscal  as if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under sfas r to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards 
although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas  we are evaluating the requirements under sfas r and expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income and net income per share

all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to the company on the date hereof  and the company assumes no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
it is important to note that the company s actual results could differ materially from those included in such forward looking statements 
the factors that could cause our results to differ from those included in such forward looking statements are set forth below  as well as those disclosed from time to time in the company s reports on forms q and k 
risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described herein include the following our operating results may fluctuate significantly due to factors which are not within our control our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and are expected to fluctuate significantly in the future based on a number of factors  many of which are not under our control 
our operating expenses  which include product development costs and selling  general and administrative expenses  are relatively fixed in the short term 
if our revenues are lower than we expect because we sell fewer semiconductor devices  delay the release of new products or the announcement of new features  or for other reasons  we may not be able to quickly reduce our spending in response 
other circumstances that can affect our operating results include the timing of significant orders  order cancellations and reschedulings  the loss of a significant customer s  our significant customers could lose market share that may affect our business  integration of our product functionality into our customers products  our ability to develop  introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis  introduction of products and technologies by our competitors  unexpected issues that may arise with devices in production shifts in our product mix toward lower margin products  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors or suppliers  including decreases in unit average selling prices of our products  the availability of production capacity at the fabrication facilities that manufacture our products  the availability and cost of materials to our suppliers  general economic conditions  and political climate 
these factors are difficult to forecast  and these or other factors could adversely affect our business 
any shortfall in our revenues would have a direct impact on our business 
in addition  fluctuations in our quarterly results could adversely affect the market price of our common stock in a manner unrelated to our long term operating performance 
we may fail to adequately integrate acquired businesses in may  we acquired netchip technology  inc  a supplier of high performance semiconductors based on universal serial bus usb and peripheral component interconnect pci standards  in a transaction accounted for as a purchase transaction 
we are continuing to integrate netchip technology  inc and its products into our business 
this integration is subject to risks commonly encountered in making such acquisitions  including  among others  loss of key personnel of the acquired company  loss of key customers and business relationships of the acquired company  the difficulty associated with assimilating and integrating the personnel  operations and technologies of the acquired company  the potential disruption of our ongoing business  and the maintenance of uniform standards  controls  procedures  employees and clients 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connections with our acquisition of netchip 
our potential future acquisitions may not be successful because of our limited experience with acquisitions in the past as part of our business strategy  we expect to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing product offerings  improve market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities 
future acquisitions could result in any or all of the following potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  large acquisition related write offs  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to other intangible assets  difficulties in the assimilation of operations  personnel  technologies  products and the information systems of the acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
we have had limited experience with acquisitions in the past and may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that may be acquired in the future 
our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business 
a downturn in the global economy may adversely affect our revenues  results of operations and financial condition demand for semiconductor components is increasingly dependent upon the rate of growth in the global economy 
if the rate of global economic growth slows  or contracts  customer demand for products could be adversely affected  which in turn could adversely affect revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
many factors could adversely affect regional or global economic growth 
some of the factors that could slow global economic growth include rising interest rates in the united states  a slowdown in the rate of growth of the chinese economy  a significant act of terrorism which disrupts global trade or consumer confidence  geopolitical tensions including war and civil unrest 
reduced levels of economic activity  or disruptions of international transportation  could adversely affect sales on either a global basis or in specific geographic regions 
because a substantial portion of our net sales is generated by a small number of large customers  if any of these customers delays or reduces its orders  our net revenues and earnings will be harmed historically  a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenues in any particular period 
in  sales to metatech accounted for of our revenues 
in  sales to metatech and am  both distributors  accounted for and  respectively  of our revenues 
in  sales to am accounted for of our revenues 
no other distributor or direct customer accounted for more than of net revenues in any period presented 
we have no long term volume purchase commitments from any of our significant customers 
we cannot be certain that our current customers will continue to place orders with us  that orders by existing customers will continue at the levels of previous periods or that we will be able to obtain orders from new customers 
in addition  some of our customers supply products to end market purchasers and any of these end market purchasers could choose to reduce or eliminate orders for our customers products 
this would in turn lower our customers orders for our products 
we anticipate that sales of our products to a relatively small number of customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales 
due to these factors  the following have in the past and may in the future reduce our net sales or earnings the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from one or more of our significant customers  the selection of competing products or in house design by one or more of our current customers  the loss of one or more of our current customers  or a failure of one or more of our current customers to pay our invoices 
our lengthy sales cycle can result in uncertainty and delays with regard to our expected revenues our customers typically perform numerous tests and extensively evaluate our products before incorporating them into their systems 
the time required for test  evaluation and design of our products into a customer s equipment can range from six to twelve months or more 
it can take an additional six to twelve months or more before a customer commences volume shipments of equipment that incorporates our products 
because of this lengthy sales cycle  we may experience a delay between the time when we increase expenses for research and development and sales and marketing efforts and the time when we generate higher revenues  if any  from these expenditures 
in addition  the delays inherent in our lengthy sales cycle raise additional risks of customer decisions to cancel or change product plans 
when we achieve a design win  there can be no assurance that the customer will ultimately ship products incorporating our products 
our business could be materially adversely affected if a significant customer curtails  reduces or delays orders during our sales cycle or chooses not to release products incorporating our products 
rapid technological change could make our products obsolete we operate in an industry that is subject to evolving industry standards  rapid technological changes  rapid changes in customer demands and the rapid introduction of new  higher performance products with shorter product life cycles 
as a result  we expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development 
however  we may not have adequate funds from operations or otherwise to devote to research and development  forcing us to reduce our research and development efforts 
also  we must manage product transitions successfully  since announcements or introductions of new products by us or our competitors could adversely affect sales of our existing products because these existing products can become obsolete or unmarketable for specific purposes 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products on a timely basis or in a manner which satisfies customer needs or achieves widespread market acceptance 
any significant delay in releasing new products could adversely affect our reputation  give a competitor a first to market advantage or allow a competitor to achieve greater market share 
the failure to adjust to rapid technological change could harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
failure of our products to gain market acceptance would adversely affect our financial condition we believe that our growth prospects depend upon our ability to gain customer acceptance of our products and technology 
market acceptance of products depends upon numerous factors  including compatibility with existing manufacturing processes and products  perceived advantages over competing products and the level of customer service available to support such products 
moreover  manufacturers often rely on a limited number of equipment vendors to meet their manufacturing equipment needs 
as a result  market acceptance of our products may be adversely affected to the extent potential customers utilize a competitor s manufacturing equipment 
there can be no assurance that growth in sales of new products will continue or that we will be successful in obtaining broad market acceptance of our products and technology 
we expect to spend a significant amount of time and resources to develop new products and refine existing products 
in light of the long product development cycles inherent in our industry  these expenditures will be made well in advance of the prospect of deriving revenues from the sale of any new products 
our ability to commercially introduce and successfully market any new products is subject to a wide variety of challenges during this development cycle  including start up bugs  design defects and other matters that could delay introduction of these products to the marketplace 
in addition  since our customers are not obligated by long term contracts to purchase our products  our anticipated product orders may not materialize  or orders that do materialize may be cancelled 
as a result  if we do not achieve market acceptance of new products  we may not be able to realize sufficient sales of our products in order to recoup research and development expenditures 
the failure of any of our new products to achieve market acceptance would harm our business  financial condition  results of operation and cash flows 
we must make significant research and development expenditures prior to generating revenues from products to establish market acceptance of a new semiconductor device  we must dedicate significant resources to research and development  production and sales and marketing 
we incur substantial costs in developing  manufacturing and selling a new product  which often significantly precede meaningful revenues from the sale of this product 
consequently  new products can require significant time and investment to achieve profitability 
investors should note that our efforts to introduce new semiconductor devices or other products or services may not be successful or profitable 
in addition  products or technologies developed by others may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
we record as expenses the costs related to the development of new semiconductor devices and other products as these expenses are incurred 
as a result  our profitability from quarter to quarter and from year to year may be adversely affected by the number and timing of our new product launches in any period and the level of acceptance gained by these products 
our independent manufacturers may not be able to meet our manufacturing requirements we do not manufacture any of our semiconductor devices 
therefore  we are referred to in the semiconductor industry as a fabless producer of semiconductors 
consequently  we depend upon third party manufacturers to produce semiconductors that meet our specifications 
we currently have third party manufacturers that can produce semiconductors which meet our needs 
however  as the semiconductor industry continues to progress towards smaller manufacturing and design geometries  the complexities of producing semiconductors will increase 
decreasing geometries may introduce new problems and delays that may affect product development and deliveries 
due to the nature of the semiconductor industry and our status as a fabless semiconductor company  we could encounter fabrication related problems that may affect the availability of our semiconductor devices  delay our shipments or may increase our costs 
none of our semiconductor devices are currently manufactured by more than one supplier 
we place our orders on a purchase order basis and do not have a long term purchase agreement with any of our existing suppliers 
in the event that the supplier of a semiconductor device was unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture this product in the required volume  we would have to identify and qualify a substitute supplier 
introducing new products or transferring existing products to a new third party manufacturer or process may result in unforeseen device specification and operating problems 
these problems may affect product shipments and may be costly to correct 
silicon fabrication capacity may also change  or the costs per silicon wafer may increase 
manufacturing related problems may have a material adverse effect on our business 
intense competition in the markets in which we operate may reduce the demand for or prices of our products competition in the semiconductor industry is intense 
if our main target market  the embedded systems market  continues to grow  the number of competitors may increase significantly 
in addition  new semiconductor technology may lead to new products that can perform similar functions as our products 
some of our competitors and other semiconductor companies may develop and introduce products that integrate into a single semiconductor device the functions performed by our semiconductor devices 
this would eliminate the need for our products in some applications 
in addition  competition in our markets comes from companies of various sizes  many of which are significantly larger and have greater financial and other resources than we do and thus can better withstand adverse economic or market conditions 
also  we compete with established embedded microprocessor companies and others 
many of these indirect competitors and microprocessor companies have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than plx 
therefore  we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors  and increased competition may adversely affect our business 
see business competition  and products in part i of item i of this form k 
failure to have our products designed into the products of electronic equipment manufacturers will result in reduced sales our future success depends on electronic equipment manufacturers that design our semiconductor devices into their systems 
we must anticipate market trends and the price  performance and functionality requirements of current and potential future electronic equipment manufacturers and must successfully develop and manufacture products that meet these requirements 
in addition  we must meet the timing requirements of these electronic equipment manufacturers and must make products available to them in sufficient quantities 
these electronic equipment manufacturers could develop products that provide the same or similar functionality as one or more of our products and render these products obsolete in their applications 
we do not have purchase agreements with our customers that contain minimum purchase requirements 
instead  electronic equipment manufacturers purchase our products pursuant to short term purchase orders that may be canceled without charge 
we believe that in order to obtain broad penetration in the markets for our products  we must maintain and cultivate relationships  directly or through our distributors  with electronic equipment manufacturers that are leaders in the embedded systems markets 
accordingly  we will incur significant expenditures in order to build relationships with electronic equipment manufacturers prior to volume sales of new products 
if we fail to develop relationships with additional electronic equipment manufacturers to have our products designed into new embedded systems or to develop sufficient new products to replace products that have become obsolete  our business would be materially adversely affected 
lower demand for our customers products will result in lower demand for our products demand for our products depends in large part on the development and expansion of the high performance embedded systems markets including networking and telecommunications  enterprise storage  imaging and industrial applications 
the size and rate of growth of these embedded systems markets may in the future fluctuate significantly based on numerous factors 
these factors include the adoption of alternative technologies  capital spending levels and general economic conditions 
demand for products that incorporate high performance embedded systems may not grow 
defects in our products could increase our costs and delay our product shipments our products are complex 
while we test our products  these products may still have errors  defects or bugs that we find only after commercial production has begun 
we have experienced errors  defects and bugs in the past in connection with new products 
our customers may not purchase our products if the products have reliability  quality or compatibility problems 
this delay in acceptance could make it more difficult to retain our existing customers and to attract new customers 
moreover  product errors  defects or bugs could result in additional development costs  diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts  claims by our customers or others against us  or the loss of credibility with our current and prospective customers 
in the past  the additional time required to correct defects has caused delays in product shipments and resulted in lower revenues 
we may have to spend significant amounts of capital and resources to address and fix problems in new products 
we must continuously develop our products using new process technology with smaller geometries to remain competitive on a cost and performance basis 
migrating to new technologies is a challenging task requiring new design skills  methods and tools and is difficult to achieve 
we could lose key personnel due to competitive market conditions and attrition our success depends to a significant extent upon our senior management and key technical and sales personnel 
the loss of one or more of these employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we do not have employment contracts with any of our executive officers 
our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified technical  sales and marketing  customer support  financial and accounting  and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel in the semiconductor industry is intense  and we may not be able to retain our key personnel or to attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified personnel in the future 
in addition  we may lose key personnel due to attrition  including health  family and other reasons 
we have experienced  and may continue to experience  difficulty in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications 
if we do not succeed in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications  our business could be materially adversely affected 
a large portion of our revenues is derived from sales to third party distributors who may terminate their relationships with us at any time we depend on distributors to sell a significant portion of our products 
in  net revenues through distributors accounted for approximately of our net revenues 
some of our distributors also market and sell competing products 
distributors may terminate their relationships with us at any time 
our future performance will depend in part on our ability to attract additional distributors that will be able to market and support our products effectively  especially in markets in which we have not previously distributed our products 
we may lose one or more of our current distributors or may not be able to recruit additional or replacement distributors 
the loss of one or more of our major distributors could have a material adverse effect on our business  as we may not be successful in servicing our customers directly or through manufacturers representatives 
the demand for our products depends upon our ability to support evolving industry standards a majority of our revenues are derived from sales of products  which rely on the pci  pci x  usb  and limited sales of pci express standards 
if markets move away from these standards and begin using new standards  we may not be able to successfully design and manufacture new products that use these new standards 
there is also the risk that new products we develop in response to new standards may not be accepted in the market 
in addition  these standards are continuously evolving  and we may not be able to modify our products to address new specifications 
any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our business 
the successful marketing and sales of our products depend upon our third party relationships  which are not supported by written agreements when marketing and selling our semiconductor devices  we believe we enjoy a competitive advantage based on the availability of development tools offered by third parties 
these development tools are used principally for the design of other parts of the embedded system but also work with our products 
we will lose this advantage if these third party tool vendors cease to provide these tools for existing products or do not offer them for our future products 
this event could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have no written agreements with these third parties  and these parties could choose to stop providing these tools at any time 
our limited ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights could adversely affect our competitive position our future success and competitive position depend upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary technology used in our principal products 
currently  we have limited protection of our intellectual property in the form of patents and rely instead on trade secret protection 
our existing or future patents may be invalidated  circumvented  challenged or licensed to others 
the rights granted thereunder may not provide competitive advantages to us 
in addition  our future patent applications may not be issued with the scope of the claims sought by us  if at all 
furthermore  others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology  duplicate our technology or design around the patents owned or licensed by us 
in addition  effective patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries where we may need protection 
we cannot be sure that steps taken by us to protect our technology will prevent misappropriation of the technology 
we may from time to time receive notifications of claims that we may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties 
while there is currently no intellectual property litigation pending against us  litigation could result in significant expenses to us and adversely affect sales of the challenged product or technology 
this litigation could also divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not the litigation is determined in our favor 
in addition  we may not be able to develop or acquire non infringing technology or procure licenses to the infringing technology under reasonable terms 
this could require expenditures by us of substantial time and other resources 
any of these developments would have a material adverse effect on our business 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry may lead to significant variances in the demand for our products in the past  the semiconductor industry has been characterized by significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand 
also  the industry has experienced significant fluctuations in anticipation of changes in general economic conditions 
this cyclicality has led to significant variances in product demand and production capacity 
it has also accelerated erosion of average selling prices per unit 
we may experience periodic fluctuations in our future financial results because of industry wide conditions 
because we sell our products to customers outside of north america and because our products are incorporated with products of others that are sold outside of north america we face foreign business  political and economic risks sales outside of north america accounted for   and of our revenues in   and  respectively 
sales outside of north america may fluctuate in future periods and is expected to account for a large portion of our revenues 
in addition  equipment manufacturers who incorporate our products into their products sell their products outside of north america  thereby exposing us indirectly to foreign risks 
further  most of our semiconductor products are manufactured outside of north america 
accordingly  we are subject to international risks  including difficulties in managing distributors  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary and branch operations  political and economic instability  foreign currency exchange fluctuations  difficulties in accounts receivable collections  potentially adverse tax consequences  timing and availability of export licenses  changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  difficulties in obtaining governmental approvals for telecommunications and other products  and the burden of complying with complex foreign laws and treaties 
because sales of our products have been denominated to date exclusively in united states dollars  increases in the value of the united states dollar will increase the price of our products so that they become relatively more expensive to customers in the local currency of a particular country  which could lead to a reduction in sales and profitability in that country 
our principal stockholders have significant voting power and may take actions that may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders our executive officers  directors and other principal stockholders  in the aggregate  beneficially own a substantial amount of our outstanding common stock 
although these stockholders do not have majority control  they currently have  and likely will continue to have  significant influence with respect to the election of our directors and approval or disapproval of our significant corporate actions 
this influence over our affairs might be adverse to the interests of other stockholders 
in addition  the voting power of these stockholders could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of plx 
the anti takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock anti takeover provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation may make a change in control of plx more difficult  even if a change in control would be beneficial to the stockholders 
these provisions may allow the board of directors to prevent changes in the management and control of plx 
as part of our anti takeover devices  our board of directors has the ability to determine the terms of preferred stock and issue preferred stock without the approval of the holders of the common stock 
our certificate of incorporation allows the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock 
there are no shares of preferred stock outstanding 
however  because the rights and preferences of any series of preferred stock may be set by the board of directors in its sole discretion without approval of the holders of the common stock  the rights and preferences of this preferred stock may be superior to those of the common stock 
accordingly  the rights of the holders of common stock may be adversely affected 
consistent with delaware law  our board of directors may adopt additional anti takeover measures in the future 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have an investment portfolio of fixed income securities  including those classified as cash equivalents  short and long term investments of approximately million at december  these securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations and will decrease in market value if interest rates increase 
the primary objective of the company s investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
the company invests primarily in high quality  short term and long term debt instruments 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in approximately a million decrease less than in the fair value of the company s available for sale securities
