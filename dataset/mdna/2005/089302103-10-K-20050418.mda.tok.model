in addition  the company s quarterly results can be affected by the timing of new store openings and store closings  the amount of sales contributed by new and existing stores  the timing of television and circular advertising  and the timing of certain holidays 
the company purchases substantial amounts of inventory and incurs higher shipping costs and higher payroll costs in the third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the increased sales activity during the fourth fiscal quarter

store remodels and conversions in conjunction with the company s initiative to change its name to big lots and operate under one brand name  approximately stores were remodeled during fiscal years and  including stores previously operating under the names odd lots  macfrugal s  and pic n save  and existing big lots stores located in conversion markets 
as of the end of fiscal year  all stores were operating under the big lots name 
the company believes that big lots is its most recognizable brand name  and this change offers numerous opportunities to increase brand awareness among customers  suppliers  investors  and the general public 
the company believes the conversion also allows it to efficiently leverage a single brand name through television advertising and other advertising programs 
in connection with this conversion and remodeling process  the company made certain improvements to the converted sites 
the improvements varied by location and included  among other things  painting  lighting retrofits  new signage interior and exterior and advertising  new flooring  and updated restrooms 
in fiscal year  the company remodeled stores 
these remodels included similar improvements and  in addition  included new fixtures and a new merchandise layout 
in fiscal year  the company remodeled stores in markets 
the company also added a closeout swing area to another stores 
the closeout swing area is located at the front of the store and features the newest and most compelling brand name closeout merchandise the store has to offer 
the selection can vary by store  and items normally only last about a week before selling out or moving to their natural location in the store 
in the last four years  the company has remodeled over stores 
based on the number of stores remodeled in the last four years  the company estimates approximately of its stores have either been remodeled or opened as new stores in the last six years 
the average cost of the improvements for converted and remodeled stores was approximately million per store during fiscal years through furniture and distribution facility growth during fiscal year  the company added furniture departments net of closed departments  ranging in size from  to  square feet 
the furniture category has grown over the last nine years to a level representing of the company s net sales in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year the company operated  furniture departments within existing closeout stores at the end of fiscal year  in addition to freestanding furniture stores 
in an effort to expand the company s furniture presence  the redlands dc was opened in fiscal year this facility began shipping merchandise in september to approximately stores principally in the western regions of the country 
the majority of these stores support approximately selling square feet of furniture with a limited merchandise assortment consisting principally of ready to assemble furniture  futons  and lamps 
with the expansion of furniture departments in the west and a selection of ready to assemble furniture in stores  the company offered a furniture assortment in  of its  closeout stores as of the end of fiscal year restatement of previously issued consolidated financial statements in light of views expressed by the office of the chief accountant of the sec on february   the company reviewed its accounting practices for operating leases 
under the requirements of the financial accounting standards board fasb technical bulletin  accounting for operating leases with scheduled rent increases  rent expense should be amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
in prior periods  the company had determined that the term of the lease began on the earlier of the commencement date of the lease or the store opening date  rather than at the time the company took physical possession of the property to start construction of leasehold improvements 
this had the effect of excluding the construction period of the stores from the straight line rent calculation 
the company has corrected its accounting policy to begin the lease term at the possession date 
the company has restated its previously reported financial statements to correct its accounting to include construction periods in store operating leases 
in addition  under fasb technical bulletin  issues relating to accounting for leases  lease incentives such as tenant allowances received from the landlord to cover construction costs incurred by the company should be reflected as a deferred liability  amortized over the term of the lease and reflected as a reduction to rent expense 
the company had previously classified tenant allowances as a reduction to property and equipment instead of as a deferred lease credit on the consolidated balance sheets 
as a result  the company also amortized the deferred lease credit over the asset life instead of over the lease term and reflected the amortization as a reduction to depreciation expense instead of as a reduction to rent expense and reflected tenant allowances as a reduction of capital expenditures within investing activities instead of a change in operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the company reassessed this accounting policy and has corrected its accounting policy to treat lease incentives received as a deferred liability amortized over the lease term 
the company has also restated the previously reported consolidated financial statements to properly account for tenant allowances 
subsequent to the issuance of the company s fiscal financial statements  the company s management determined that investments in certain mutual funds and company stock associated with a non qualified deferred compensation plan were incorrectly presented as cash instead of non current assets and treasury stock on the consolidated balance sheet 
furthermore  the corresponding deferred compensation liability was incorrectly presented as a current liability instead of a non current liability and the acquisition of treasury stock was incorrectly presented as a component of operating activity instead of financing activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the company evaluated the materiality of these corrections on its financial statements and concluded that the incremental impact of these corrections is not material to any quarterly or annual period  however  the cumulative effect of these corrections is material to the fourth quarter of fiscal year as a result  the company has recorded the cumulative effect as of fiscal year  and has restated the consolidated balance sheet at january   and the consolidated statements of operations  shareholders equity and cash flows for the years ended january  and february  in this annual report on form k 
the company has restated the quarterly financial information for fiscal year  fiscal year  and the first three quarters of fiscal year included in this annual report on form k 
the company has restated the applicable financial information for fiscal years    and in item selected financial data 
the company did not amend its previously filed annual reports on form k or quarterly reports on form q for the restatement  and the financial statements and related financial information contained in such reports should no longer be relied upon 
throughout this annual report on form k all referenced amounts for prior periods and prior period comparisons reflect the balances and amounts on a restated basis 
the restatement primarily resulted in a decrease to net income of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the restatement did not impact income loss from discontinued operations and the related per common share calculations 
the cumulative effect of these accounting corrections reduced retained earnings by million at the beginning of fiscal year additionally  the restatement resulted in an increase in cash flows provided by operating activities of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
additionally  the restatement resulted in an increase in cash used in investing activities of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
see note restatement of previously issued consolidated financial statements to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for a summary of the effects of these changes on the consolidated financial statements 
this management s discussion and analysis gives effect to these corrections 
investments in auction rate preferred securities and municipal auction rate securities collectively  auction rate securities have been reclassified from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments on the consolidated balance sheet at january  this reclassification was made because the auction rate securities had stated maturities beyond three months 
the amount of auction rate securities included in short term investments was million at january  there were no auction rate securities at january  the auction rate securities reclassification resulted in an increase of purchases of short term investments and an increase of net cash used in investing activities of million in the fiscal year consolidated statement of cash flows 
the auction rate securities resulted in an increase of million in purchases of short term investments and an increase of million in the redemption of short term investments in the fiscal year consolidated statement of cash flows 
the reclassifications had no impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the company s inventory of maintenance parts and certain deposits aggregating million have been reclassified from other current assets to other long term assets on the consolidated balance sheet at january   to reflect the expected use of those assets 
self insurance reserves in the amount of million have been reclassified from accrued liabilities to other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at january   to reflect the projected timing of payments 
deferred income tax assets of million related to these reclassifications have been reclassified from current assets to long term assets on the consolidated balanced sheet at january  kb toys matters on january   kb acquisition corporation and certain affiliated entities collectively  kb filed for bankruptcy protection pursuant to chapter of title of the united states code 
kb acquired the kb toys business from the company pursuant to a stock purchase agreement dated as of december  the kb stock purchase agreement 
the company analyzed the information currently available regarding the effect of kb s bankruptcy filing on the various continuing rights and obligations of the parties to the kb stock purchase agreement  including a an outstanding note from havens corners corporation  a subsidiary of kb acquisition corporation and a party to the bankruptcy proceedings hcc  to the company  and an accompanying warrant to acquire common stock of kb holdings  inc  the ultimate parent of kb and a party to the bankruptcy proceedings kb holdings  b the status of kb s indemnification obligations to the company with respect to guarantees of kb store leases by the company and guarantees relating to lease and mortgage obligations for which the company has indemnification obligations arising out of its acquisition of the kb toys business from melville corporation now known as cvs new york  inc  and together with its subsidiaries cvs  and c the status of the company s and kb s other indemnification obligations to each other with respect to general liability claims  representations and warranties  litigation  taxes  and other payment obligations pursuant to the kb stock purchase agreement 
when and to the extent the company believes that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated  the company records a liability 
the company recorded a million charge net of tax in the fourth quarter of fiscal year associated with the estimated impact of the kb bankruptcy  which was comprised of a million benefit net of tax related to the partial charge off of the hcc note and kb warrant as each is defined below and a million charge net of tax related to kb guarantee obligations 
as discussed below  the company recorded an additional million charge net of tax in the third quarter of fiscal year related to the estimated impact of additional guarantee obligations resulting from the kb bankruptcy 
in connection with the sale of the kb toys business  the company received million in cash and a year note from hcc in the aggregate principal amount of million 
this note bears interest  on an in kind basis  at the rate of per annum principal and interest together known as the hcc note 
the company also received a warrant to acquire up to of the common stock of kb holdings for a stated price per share kb warrant 
at the time of the sale the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company evaluated the fair value of the hcc note received as consideration in the transaction and recorded the hcc note at its then estimated fair value of million 
the estimated fair value of the hcc note was based on several factors  including fair market evaluations obtained from independent financial advisors at the time of the sale  the company s knowledge of the underlying kb toys business and industry  and the risks inherent in receiving no cash payments until the hcc note matured in during fiscal year and until kb s bankruptcy filing  the company recorded the interest earned and accretion of the discount utilizing the effective interest rate method and provided necessary reserves against such amounts as a result of its evaluations of the carrying value of the hcc note 
as of february  and february   the carrying value of the hcc note was million 
for tax purposes  the hcc note was originally recorded at its face value of million  and the company incurred tax liability on the interest  which was accrued but was not payable 
this resulted in the hcc note having a tax basis that was greater than the carrying value on the company s books 
the hcc note became immediately due and payable at the time of kb s bankruptcy filing 
the company engaged an independent investment advisory firm to assist the company in estimating the fair value of the hcc note and kb warrant for both book and tax purposes 
as a result  the company charged off a portion of the hcc note and wrote down the full value of the kb warrant resulting in a book value of the hcc note of million  and accordingly recorded a net charge before tax to continuing operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal year in the amount of million 
in addition  as a result of the bankruptcy filing and the partial charge off  the company recorded a tax benefit of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year a substantial portion of this tax benefit reflects the charge off of the higher tax basis of the hcc note 
the book value of the hcc note was million at january   and january  the hcc note is recorded as a component of long term assets on the consolidated balance sheets at january   and january  when the company acquired the kb toys business from cvs in may  the company provided  among other things  an indemnity to cvs with respect to any losses resulting from kb s failure to pay all monies due and owing under any kb lease or mortgage obligation guaranteed by cvs 
the typical form of the cvs guarantee provides that the terms of the underlying lease may be extended  amended  modified or in any way changed without the consent of the guarantor 
while the company controlled the kb toys business  the company provided guarantees containing terms similar to the cvs guarantees with respect to a limited number of additional store leases 
as part of the kb sale  and in accordance with the terms of the kb stock purchase agreement  kb similarly agreed to indemnify the company with respect to all lease and mortgage obligations  including those guaranteed by cvs and those guaranteed by the company 
to the company s knowledge  the company has guarantee or indemnification obligations  as of january   with respect to a approximately kb store leases  b two distribution center leases  c kb s main office building lease  and d a first mortgage on a distribution center located in pittsfield  massachusetts the pittsfield dc 
in connection with the bankruptcy  kb is generally required to continue to make lease payments with respect to all non residential real estate leases until the bankruptcy court approves kb s decision to reject a lease and kb vacates the leased premises that it rejects 
if kb rejects a lease that has been guaranteed by the company or by cvs  because kb can reject its indemnification obligations to the company  the company could be liable for all or a portion of the lease obligations with respect to the rejected leases  subject to many factors  including the landlord s duty to mitigate  and the validity of the applicable guarantee 
on february   the company announced that kb had rejected store leases  of which the company believes it has guarantee or indemnification obligations relating to approximately the company engaged an independent real estate valuation firm to assist in the analysis of the company s potential liability with respect to the guaranteed leases 
based upon analysis of the information then available  the company recorded a charge to discontinued operations for rent and legal expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal year in the amount of million net after a million tax benefit to reflect its best estimate of this loss contingency 
on october   kb announced its intent to close an additional to underperforming stores and reject those leases by january  at october   the company believed that kb had rejected approximately store leases and that the company has guarantee or indemnification obligations relating to approximately of those leases including resulting from kb s october   announcement 
using the same methodology to analyze the company s potential liability with respect to these additional guaranteed leases  the company recorded a charge to discontinued operations in the third quarter of fiscal year in the amount of million net after a million tax benefit to reflect its best estimate of this loss contingency 
since october   the company believes that kb has both rejected a limited number of additional store leases and withdrew its previous rejection of certain other store leases 
kb s actions have resulted in a net increase of approximately store lease rejections bringing the total rejections to approximately  for which the company believes it has guarantee or indemnification obligations 
no additional charges related to the guarantee obligations have been recorded by the company since october  on march   the company announced that it had received notice of a default relating to a first mortgage on the pittsfield dc 
as a result of kb s bankruptcy filing  the mortgage holder declared an event of default and claimed that the loan had become immediately due and payable the pittsfield dc note 
the company was informed that  as of january   the pittsfield dc note had an outstanding principal balance of approximately million plus accrued interest of approximately  additionally  the mortgage holder claimed that a make whole premium of approximately million was also due and payable 
on november   the company satisfied its indemnity obligation with respect to the pittsfield dc note at a cost of million 
the company engaged an independent real estate valuation firm to assist it in the analysis of the company s potential loss arising from the indemnification payment related to the pittsfield dc note 
based upon analysis of the information then available  the company recorded a charge to discontinued operations in the third quarter of fiscal year in the amount of million net after a million tax benefit to reflect its best estimate of the difference between the subrogation rights million flowing from the indemnification payment and the net realizable value of the pittsfield dc 
the company intends to take an active role in limiting its potential liability with respect to kb store lease obligations and the pittsfield dc note 
the company is not aware of any additional rejections of the remaining store leases guaranteed by the company  or a rejection of the two distribution center leases or the lease on kb s main office building 
it is the company s belief that both distribution centers have been sublet by kb to unaffiliated third parties and that kb intends to retain the lease on its main office building 
in its october   announcement  kb stated that it believed this would be the final round of store closings before its emergence from bankruptcy 
nevertheless  due to the nature of the kb bankruptcy  the company is unable to determine at this time whether any additional liability will result from the remaining leases guaranteed by the company or cvs that have not yet been rejected by kb 
moreover  since the typical form of guarantee permits an extension  amendment  modification or other change  the company is unable to estimate its maximum potential amount of future payments  if any  required to satisfy lease guarantees 
in the event additional leases are rejected  any related charge would be to discontinued operations 
management does not believe that such a charge would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of continuing operations  or liquidity 
in addition to including kb s indemnity of the company with respect to lease and mortgage obligations  the kb stock purchase agreement contains mutual indemnifications of kb by the company and of the company by kb 
these indemnifications relate primarily to losses arising out of general liability claims  breached or inaccurate representations or warranties  shared litigation expenses  other payment obligations  and taxes 
under a tax indemnification provision in the kb stock purchase agreement  the company is to indemnify kb for tax losses generally related to the periods prior to the company s sale of kb 
the company continues to assess the effect of the kb bankruptcy on such mutual indemnification obligations and has not made any provision for loss contingencies with respect to any non lease or non tax related indemnification obligations 
at this time  management does not believe that such a charge would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of continuing operations  or liquidity 
the following are the components of discontinued operations fiscal year in thousands loss on disposal of kb toys business  net of income tax benefit of   and  in fiscal years   and  respectively 
during fiscal year  the internal revenue service irs concluded its field examination of the company s consolidated income tax returns for the fiscal year through fiscal year cycle 
the consolidated income tax returns for that cycle included the kb toys business 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the fiscal year through fiscal year irs examination cycle was substantially resolved when the congressional joint committee on taxation found no exception to the irs field examination report for further discussion  refer to note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
the company has also received substantial resolution with the appeals division of the irs related to a kb income tax matter for fiscal year in conjunction with the macfrugal s bargains close outs  inc appeal for further discussion  refer to note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
discontinued operations also reflect the substantial resolution and closure of tax audit activity  the closing of the statute of limitations  and changes in the expected outcome of tax contingencies related to kb state and local non income tax matters 
as a result of the substantial resolution and closure of these items  the company has reversed previously accrued income taxes of approximately million  and sales and use taxes of approximately million related to discontinued operations in fiscal year on february   the company commenced a suit in the delaware chancery court against certain of the officers  directors and shareholders of kb alleging fraud  breach of fiduciary duty  aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty  unjust enrichment  and civil conspiracy 
on march   the united states bankruptcy court district of delaware  finding that litigating the state court action would distract kb s management and thereby hinder its ability to focus on a successful reorganization  temporarily enjoined the company s suit until july   assuming kb or the official committee of unsecured creditors propose a confirmable plan of reorganization by may  the company intends to vigorously prosecute this action to recover its damages arising from defendants actions resulting in kb s inability to satisfy the hcc note 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales net sales increased to  million in fiscal year compared to  million in fiscal year the company attributes this increase principally to new store growth as comparable store sales were flat for fiscal year comparable store sales for fiscal year were calculated using all stores that were open for at least two fiscal years as of the beginning of fiscal year comparable store sales consisted of a increase in the value of the average basket driven by strong gains in hardlines and home d cor departments  as well as the addition of new furniture departments 
average basket gains were offset by a decrease in the number of customer transactions  which the company believes was principally the result of the impact that macro economic pressure of higher prices for gas  home heating oil  and other commodities had on the company s core customer which has an estimated average household income of the company believes that future sales growth is dependent upon an increase in the number of customer transactions as well as an increase in the dollar value of the average basket

gross profit gross profit increased to  million in fiscal year compared to  million in fiscal year gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year this gross profit rate decline of basis points was primarily due to lower sales in higher margin merchandise  such as seasonal and toys  an increased markdown rate due to a flat comparable store sales and the need for additional markdowns on seasonally sensitive categories  giftable items with low sell through rates  and selected discontinued styles in furniture 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased to  million in fiscal year compared to  million in fiscal year selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year selling and administrative expenses increased over fiscal year primarily due to an increase in the number of stores  costs associated with higher levels of sales  and increased carton volume

fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales net sales for fiscal year increased to  million compared to net sales of  million for fiscal year this increase resulted from a comparable store sales increase of  with the remaining increase driven primarily by sales from stores opened on or after february   offset by store closings 
comparable store sales for fiscal year were calculated using all stores that were open for at least two fiscal years as of the beginning of fiscal year the company attributes its comparable store sales increase of to an increase in the dollar value of the average basket of and an increase in the number of customer transactions of 
the company believes the increase in the number of customer transactions and the increase in the dollar value of the average basket for fiscal year resulted from several factors such as the launch of the company s first national television advertising campaign covering all  stores  more productive advertising circulars  the introduction of furniture departments in stores over the prior year  the allocation of additional square footage to furniture departments in existing closeout stores  and improved in stock levels on everyday basic items

the company believes the basis point decrease in the gross profit percentage was driven by a reduction of basis points in the initial markup of merchandise due to a combination of better than expected sales in lower markup categories  such as consumables  and increased freight rates related to imported merchandise

for a discussion of leases  refer to note leases to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
many of the store lease obligations require the company to pay for cam  real estate taxes  and property insurance 
the company estimates that future obligations for cam  real estate taxes  and property insurance are million at january  the company has made certain assumptions and estimates in order to account for its contractual obligations relative to cam  real estate taxes  and property insurance 
those assumptions and estimates include  but are not limited to extrapolation of historical data to estimate the company s future obligations  calculation of the company s obligations based on per square foot averages where no historical data is available for a particular leasehold  and assumptions related to certain increases over historical data where the company s obligation is a prorated share of all lessees obligations within a particular property 
the remaining million relates primarily to the operating leases of certain office equipment with remaining terms of less than one year or a month to month basis 
for purposes of the operating lease and purchase obligation disclosures  the company has assumed that it will make all payments scheduled or reasonably estimated to be made under those obligations that have a determinable expiration date  and the company disregarded the possibility that such obligations may be prematurely terminated or extended  whether automatically by the terms of the obligation or by agreement of the company and its vendor  due to the speculative nature of premature termination or extension 
where an operating lease or purchase obligation is subject to a month to month term or another automatically renewing term  the company disclosed its minimum commitment under such obligation  such as one month in the case of a month to month obligation and the then current term in the case of another automatically renewing term  due to the uncertainty of the length of the eventual term

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could materially differ from those estimates 
the company s accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap are also described in note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
the items listed below are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all the company s accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap  with no need for management s judgment in the principles application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
the company has certain critical accounting policies and accounting estimates  which are described below 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the average cost retail inventory method 
market is determined based on the estimated net realizable value  which generally is the merchandise selling price 
under the retail inventory method  inventory is segregated into departments of merchandise having similar characteristics  and is stated at its current retail selling value 
inventory retail values are converted to a cost basis by applying specific average cost factors for each merchandise department 
cost factors represent the average cost to retail ratio for each merchandise department based on beginning inventory and the fiscal year purchase activity 
the retail inventory method requires management to make judgments and contains estimates  such as the amount and timing of markdowns to clear unproductive or slow moving inventory  which may impact the ending inventory valuation and gross profit 
these assumptions are based on historical experience and current information 
factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of the merchandise  and seasonal trends 
permanent markdowns are recorded as a gross profit reduction in the period of management s decision to initiate price reductions with the intent not to return the price to regular retail 
promotional markdowns are recorded as a gross profit reduction in the period the merchandise is sold 
shrinkage is estimated as a percentage of sales for the period from the last physical inventory date to the end of the fiscal year 
such estimates are based on experience and the most recent physical inventory results 
while it is not possible to quantify the impact from each cause of shrinkage  the company has loss prevention programs and policies that it believes will minimize shrinkage 
due to the nature of the company s purchasing practices for closeout and deeply discounted merchandise  vendors and merchandise suppliers generally do not offer the company incentives such as slotting fees  cooperative advertising allowances  buy down agreements  or other forms of rebates that could materially reduce its cost of sales 
property and equipment property and equipment for the company s general office  stores  regional offices  information technology services  and outbound distribution and transportation services are stated at cost 
depreciation and amortization expense are recorded using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the lease term 
the estimated useful lives by major asset category are as follows land improvements years buildings and leasehold improvements years fixtures and equipment years transportation equipment years capitalized interest was million  million  and million in fiscal years   and  respectively 
impairment the company has long lived assets that consist primarily of property and equipment 
the company estimates useful lives on buildings and equipment using assumptions based on historical data and industry trends 
impairment is recorded if the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows 
the company s assumptions related to estimates of future cash flows are based on historical results of cash flows adjusted for management projections for future periods 
the company estimates the fair value of its long lived assets using readily available market information for similar assets 
insurance reserves the company is self insured for certain losses relating to general liability  workers compensation  and employee medical benefit claims  and the company has purchased stop loss coverage to limit significant exposure in these areas 
accrued insurance liabilities are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
such amounts are determined by applying actuarially based calculations taking into account known trends and projections of future results 
actual claims experience can impact these calculations and  to the extent that subsequent claim costs vary from estimates  future earnings could be impacted and the impact could be material 
income taxes the company s income tax accounts reflect estimates of the outcome or settlement of various asserted and unasserted income tax contingencies including tax audits and administrative appeals 
at any point in time  several tax years may be in various stages of audit or appeal or could be subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions 
this requires a periodic identification and evaluation of significant doubtful or controversial issues 
the results of the audits  appeals  or expiration of the statute of limitations are reflected in the income tax accounts accordingly 
the company has generated deferred tax assets and liabilities due to temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
the company has established a valuation allowance to reduce its net deferred tax assets to the balance that is more likely than not to be realized 
the effective income tax rate in any period may be materially impacted by the overall level of income loss before income taxes  the jurisdictional mix and magnitude of income loss  changes in the income tax laws which may be retroactive to the beginning of the fiscal year  changes in the expected outcome or settlement of an income tax contingency  changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance  and adjustments of a deferred tax asset or liability for enacted changes in tax laws or rates 
pension liabilities pension and other retirement benefits  including all relevant assumptions required by gaap  are evaluated each year 
due to the technical nature of retirement accounting  outside actuaries are used to provide assistance in calculating the estimated future obligations 
since there are many assumptions used to estimate future retirement benefits  differences between actual future events and prior estimates and assumptions could result in adjustments to pension expense and obligations 
certain actuarial assumptions  such as the discount rate and expected long term rate of return  have a significant effect on the amounts reported for net periodic pension cost and the related benefit obligations 
the company reviews external data and historical trends to help determine the discount rate and expected long term rate of return 
the company s objective in selecting a discount rate is to identify the best estimate of the rate at which the benefit obligations would be settled on the measurement date 
in making this estimate  the company reviews rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the benefits 
this process includes a review of the bonds available on the measurement date with a quality rating of aa or better 
the discount rate used to determine the net periodic pension cost for fiscal year was 
a increase in the discount rate would reduce the net periodic pension cost by million 
a reduction in the discount rate would increase the net periodic pension cost by million 
to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets  the company considered the historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class  as well as the current or anticipated future allocation of the pension portfolio 
this resulted in the selection of the long term rate of return on assets for fiscal year a increase in the expected long term rate of return would decrease the net periodic pension cost by million 
a decrease in the expected long term rate of return would increase the net periodic pension cost by million 
commitments and contingencies in the ordinary course of its business  the company is subject to various legal actions and claims 
in connection with such actions and claims  the company must make estimates of potential future legal obligations and liabilities  which requires the use of management s judgment on the outcome of various issues 
management may also use outside legal counsel to assist in the estimating process  however  the ultimate outcome of various legal issues could be materially different from management s estimates and adjustments to income could be required 
the assumptions used by management are based on the requirements of fasb  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the company will record  if material  a liability when it has determined that the occurrence of a loss contingency is probable and the loss amount can be reasonably estimated  and it will disclose the related facts in the notes to its financial statements 
if the company determines that the occurrence of a loss contingency is reasonably possible or that it is probable but the loss cannot be reasonably estimated  the company will  if material  disclose the nature of the loss contingency and the estimated range of possible loss or include a statement that no estimate of loss can be made 
the company makes these determinations in consultation with its attorneys 
revenue recognition the company recognizes retail sales in its stores at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise 
all sales are net of discounts and returns and exclude sales tax 
the reserve for retail merchandise returns is based on the company s prior experience 
wholesale sales are recognized in accordance with the shipping terms agreed upon in the purchase order 
wholesale sales are predominantly recognized under fob origin where title and risk of loss pass to the buyer when the merchandise leaves the company s distribution facility 
however  when the shipping terms are fob destination  recognition of sales revenue is delayed until completion of delivery to the designated location 
the company recognizes gift card sales revenue at the time of redemption 
the liability for the gift cards is established for the cash value at the time of purchase 
the liability for outstanding gift cards is recorded in accrued liabilities 
the company offers price hold contracts on selected furniture merchandise 
revenue for price hold contracts is recognized when the customer makes the final payment and takes possession of the merchandise 
in the event that a sale is not consummated  liquidated damages are recorded as the lesser of a  b of the merchandise purchase price exclusive of sales tax  or c the amounts deposited by the customer 
cash paid by the customers is recorded in accrued liabilities 
cost of sales cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise including related inbound freight to the company s distribution centers  duties  and commissions  markdowns  and inventory shrinkage  net of cash discounts and rebates 
the company classifies outbound distribution and transportation costs as selling and administrative expenses 
due to this classification  the company s gross profit rates may not be comparable to those of other retailers that include outbound distribution and transportation costs in cost of sales 
selling and administrative expenses the company includes store expenses such as payroll and occupancy costs  outbound distribution and transportation costs to the company s stores  advertising  purchasing  insurance  and overhead costs in selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expense rates may not be comparable to those of other retailers that include outbound distribution and transportation costs in cost of sales 
rent expense rent expense is recognized over the term of the lease 
the company recognizes minimum rent starting when possession of the property is taken from the landlord  which normally includes a construction period prior to store opening 
when a lease contains a predetermined fixed escalation of the minimum rent  the company recognizes the related rent expense on a straight line basis and records the difference between the recognized rental expense and the amounts payable under the lease as deferred incentive rent 
the company also receives tenant allowances  which are recorded in deferred incentive rent and are amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease 
deferred incentive rent is reflected in other liabilities 
the company s straight line rent expense calculation is consistent with gaap as recently clarified by the office of the chief accountant of the sec 
certain leases provide for contingent rents that are not measurable at inception 
these contingent rents are primarily based on a percentage of sales that are in excess of a predetermined level 
these amounts are excluded from minimum rent and are included in the determination of total rent expense when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable 
discontinued operations the reserve for discontinued operations includes management s estimate of the company s potential liability under its lease and mortgage obligations which have been rejected by kb as part of its bankruptcy proceeding
