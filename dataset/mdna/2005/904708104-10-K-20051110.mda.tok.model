sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  establishes standards for reporting information regarding operating segments in annual financial statements and requires selected information of those segments to be presented in interim financial reports issued to stockholders 
operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise for which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker  or decision making group  in making decisions on how to allocate resources and assess performance 
the company s chief operating decision maker  as defined under sfas no 
 is the company s chief executive officer 
the company has six operating segments based on the information reviewed by its chief executive officer us rental and cleaning  canadian rental and cleaning  manufacturing mfg  specialty garments rental and cleaning specialty garments  first aid and corporate 
the us rental and cleaning and canadian rental and cleaning operating segments have been combined to form the us and canadian rental and cleaning reporting segment 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for the company s disclosure of segment information 
the us and canadian rental and cleaning reporting segment purchases  rents  cleans  delivers and sells  uniforms and protective clothing and non garment items in the united states and canada 
the operations of the us and canadian rental and cleaning reporting segment are referred to by the company as its industrial laundry operations and the locations related to this reporting segment are referred to as industrial laundries 
the mfg operating segment designs and manufactures uniforms and non garment items solely for the purpose of providing these goods to the us and canadian rental and cleaning reporting segment 
the amounts reflected as revenues of mfg are generated when goods are shipped from the company s manufacturing facilities to other company locations 
these revenues are recorded at a transfer price which is typically in excess of the actual manufacturing cost 
the transfer price is determined by management and may not necessarily represent the fair value of the products manufactured 
products are carried in inventory and subsequently placed in service and amortized at this transfer price 
on a consolidated basis  intercompany mfg revenues and mfg income are eliminated and the carrying value of inventories and rental merchandise in service is reduced to the manufacturing cost 
income before income taxes from mfg net of the intercompany mfg elimination was million  million  and million for years ended august   august  and august   respectively 
this income offsets the merchandise amortization costs incurred by the us and canadian rental and cleaning reporting segment as the merchandise costs of this reporting segment are amortized and recognized based on inventories purchased from mfg at the transfer price which is above the company s manufacturing cost 
the corporate operating segment consists of costs associated with the company s distribution center  sales and marketing  information systems  engineering  materials management  manufacturing planning  finance  budgeting  human resources  other general and administrative costs and interest expense 
the revenues generated from the corporate operating segment represent certain direct sales made by the company directly from its distribution center 
the products sold by this operating segment are the same products rented and sold by the us and canadian rental and cleaning reporting segment 
in the segment disclosures in note to the consolidated financial statements  no assets or capital expenditures are presented for the corporate operating segment as no assets are allocated to this operating segment in the information reviewed by the chief executive officer 
however  depreciation and amortization expense related to certain assets are reflected in income from operations and income before income taxes for the corporate operating segment 
the assets that give rise to this depreciation and amortization are included in the total assets of the us and canadian rental and cleaning reporting segment as this is how they are tracked and reviewed by the company 
the specialty garments operating segment purchases  rents  cleans  delivers and sells  specialty garments and non garment items primarily for nuclear and clean room applications 
the first aid operating segment sells first aid cabinet services and other safety supplies 
in fiscal and prior  no assets or capital expenditures are presented for the first aid operating segment as no assets were allocated to this operating segment in the information reviewed by the chief executive officer as they were not material 
however  depreciation and amortization expense related to certain assets are reflected in income from operations and income before income taxes for the first aid operating segment 
the assets that give rise to this depreciation and amortization in fiscal and prior are included in the total assets of the us and canadian rental and cleaning reporting segment as this is how they were tracked and reviewed by the company 
after the textilease acquisition in fiscal  the company began allocating assets to this operating segment as the total assets related to first aid increased 
approximately of the company s revenues in were derived from us and canadian rental and cleaning  and corporate 
a key driver of this business is the number of workers employed by the customers of the company 
our revenues are directly impacted by fluctuations in these employment levels 
revenues from specialty garments  which accounted for of our revenues  increase during outages and refueling by nuclear power plants  as garment usage increases at these times 
first aid represented of total revenue in critical accounting policies and estimates the company believes the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
there have been no changes in judgments or estimates that had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements for the periods presented 
foreign currency translation the functional currency of unifirst s foreign operations is the local country s currency 
transaction gains and losses  including gains and losses on intercompany transactions  are included in selling and administrative expenses  in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
assets and liabilities of operations outside the united states are translated into us dollars using period end exchange rates 
revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during each month during the fiscal year 
the effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are included in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts the company recognizes revenue from rental operations in the period in which the services are provided 
direct sale revenue is recognized in the period in which the product is shipped 
management judgments and estimates are used in determining the collectability of accounts receivable and evaluating the adequacy of allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company considers specific accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and the age of outstanding balances as part of its evaluation 
changes in estimates are reflected in the period they become known 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
material changes in management s estimates may result in significant differences in the amount and timing of bad debt expense recognition for any given period 
inventories and rental merchandise in service inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value  net of any reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
judgments and estimates are used in determining the likelihood that new goods on hand can be sold to customers or used in rental operations 
historical inventory usage and current revenue trends are considered in estimating both excess and obsolete inventories 
if actual product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the company uses the first in  first out fifo method to value its inventories 
inventories primarily consist of finished goods 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company changed its accounting policy for a portion of its inventories from last in  first out lifo  to the first in  first out fifo method of accounting 
this change had no impact on the consolidated statements of income for any period presented 
the company believes that the fifo method is preferable to lifo because i all of the company s primary competitors currently use the fifo inventory method  therefore  the change will make the comparison of results among these companies more consistent ii the change is consistent with the increased emphasis on consistency between generally accepted accounting principals gaap in the united states and international accounting standards ias which provide that the fifo or weighted average methods are acceptable and does not provide for the use the lifo method iii this change will result in all of the company s inventories being valued consistently using the fifo method of accounting and iv due to the current low inflation levels  the company s inventory costs have remained fairly constant and are not expected to increase in the near future 
consistent with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  the company has retroactively restated its prior financial statements 
the impact of this change increased inventories  accrued income taxes  and retained earnings approximately million  million  and million  respectively  on the august  consolidated balance sheet and increased retained earnings by approximately million as of august  and august  as presented on the consolidated statements of shareholders equity 
rental merchandise in service is being amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated service lives of the merchandise  which range from to months 
in establishing estimated lives for merchandise in service  management considers historical experience and the intended use of the merchandise 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of operating profit for any period if management makes significant changes to these estimates 
goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized 
sfas no 
requires that companies test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
in addition  sfas also requires that companies test goodwill if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit to which goodwill is assigned below its carrying amount 
the company s evaluation considers changes in the operating environment  competitive information  market trends  operating performance and cash flow modeling 
management completes its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and there have been no impairments of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets in fiscal  or future events could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangibles associated with previously acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangible assets are depreciated or amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
long lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate an asset may be impaired 
there have been no material impairments of property  plant and equipment  or definite lived intangible assets in fiscal   or insurance the company self insures for certain obligations related to health  workers compensation  vehicles and general liability programs 
the company also purchases stop loss insurance policies to protect itself from catastrophic losses 
judgments and estimates are used in determining the potential value associated with reported claims and for events that have occurred  but have not been reported 
the company s estimates consider historical claim experience and other factors 
the company s liabilities are based on estimates  and  while the company believes that its accruals are adequate  the ultimate liability may be significantly different from the amounts recorded 
changes in claim experience  the company s ability to settle claims or other estimates and judgments used by management could have a material impact on the amount and timing of expense for any given period 
environmental and other contingencies the company is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the conduct of its business operations  including environmental matters  personal injury  customer contract matters and employment claims 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability  as well as the amount to be recorded 
the company regularly consults with attorneys and outside consultants to ensure that all of the relevant facts and circumstances are considered  before a contingent liability is recorded 
the company records accruals for environmental and other contingencies based on enacted laws  regulatory orders or decrees  the company s estimates of costs  insurance proceeds  participation by other parties  the timing of payments  and the input of outside consultants and attorneys 
the estimated liability for environmental contingencies has been discounted using risk free interest rates ranging from to over periods ranging from ten to thirty years 
the estimated current costs  net of legal settlements with insurance carriers  have been adjusted for the estimated impact of inflation at per year 
changes in enacted laws  regulatory orders or decrees  management s estimates of costs  insurance proceeds  participation by other parties  the timing of payments and the input of outside consultants and attorneys based on changing legal or factual circumstances could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for environmental and other contingent liabilities 
refer to note of these consolidated financial statements for additional discussion and analysis 
asset retirement obligations effective september   the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which generally applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset 
under this accounting method  the company recognizes asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
the company will depreciate  on a straight line basis  the amount added to property and equipment and recognize accretion expense in connection with the discounted liability over the various remaining lives which range from approximately one to thirty years 
the estimated liability has been based on historical experience in decommissioning nuclear laundry facilities  estimated useful lives of the underlying assets  external vendor estimates as to the cost to decommission these assets in the future  and federal and state regulatory requirements 
the estimated current costs have been adjusted for the estimated impact of inflation at per year 
the liability has been discounted using credit adjusted risk free rates that range from approximately to over one to thirty years 
revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in the company s estimated useful lives of the underlying assets  estimated dates of decommissioning  changes in decommissioning costs  changes in federal or state regulatory guidance on the decommissioning of such facilities  or other changes in estimates 
changes due to revised estimates will be recognized by adjusting the carrying amount of the liability and the related long lived asset if the assets are still in service  or charged to expense in the period if the assets are no longer in service 
pensions the calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of critical assumptions  including the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions 
pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases 
future changes in plan asset returns  assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities 
we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the amounts recognized for income tax and financial reporting purposes at currently enacted tax rates

revenues us and canadian rental and cleaning mfg net interco mfg elim specialty garments first aid corporate total for the year ended august       for the year ended august       for the year ended august       income loss from operations us and canadian rental and cleaning mfg net interco mfg elim specialty garments first aid corporate total for the year ended august     for the year ended august       for the year ended august      fiscal year ended august  compared with fiscal year ended august  revenues in  revenues increased to million as compared with million for  which was primarily attributable to organic growth within our existing operations of approximately 
this increase in existing operations was primarily due to revenue growth in the industrial laundry operations and corporate which accounted for of the increase 
revenues from specialty garments and first aid accounted for and of the increase  respectively 
in addition  current year acquisitions contributed an additional to the increase in revenues 
the increase in revenue for was modest due to a particularly competitive pricing environment 
operating costs operating costs increased to million for as compared with million for however  operating costs decreased as a percentage of revenues from in to in the primary reasons for this decrease were lower merchandise amortization as a result of cost savings realized in mfg  lower merchandise amortization for the industrial laundry locations acquired as part of the textilease acquisition and lower industrial laundry production payroll costs as a percentage of revenues 
these benefits were somewhat offset by higher energy costs associated with operating our industrial laundries and our fleet of delivery trucks 
selling and administrative expenses the company s selling and administrative expenses increased to of revenues in  or million  as compared to of revenues in  or million 
the increase in selling and administrative expenses is primarily due to an increase in the sales force within us and canadian rental and cleaning 
this growth within the sales force is the result of the company s effort to foster increased revenue growth 
depreciation and amortization the company s depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million  or of revenues for  as compared with million  or of revenues for the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily related to certain fixed assets owned by the company becoming fully depreciated in fiscal  as well as certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized in fiscal in us and canadian rental and cleaning and corporate 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization also relates to a charge of approximately million recorded by the company to depreciation in related to the write down  to net realizable value  of certain machinery and equipment at its richmond industrial laundry location that closed during fiscal income from operations the company s income from operations increased million to million for the year ended august  as compared with million for the year ended august  this increase is primarily due to an increase in income from operations during these periods of million in us and canadian rental and cleaning and an increase of million in mfg  net of intercompany mfg elimination 
these increases were offset by an increase in loss from operations of million in corporate  and lower income from operations of million in first aid and million in specialty garments 
the increase in us and canadian rental and cleaning is due to increased revenues  lower operating costs as a percentage of revenues offset by higher selling and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues 
the reasons for these fluctuations in revenues and cost are discussed above 
the increase in the loss from operations in corporate is due primarily to increased payroll and other costs related to the company s distribution center and corporate offices offset by decreases in depreciation expense as discussed above 
the decrease in income from operations in first aid is primarily due to increased costs associated with this segment s new pill packaging facility 
other expense the company s net interest expense was million  or of revenues in  as compared with million  or of revenues in the decrease in interest expense was due to a reduction in the level of debt outstanding during the fiscal year 
the average debt outstanding in was million as compared to million in this was offset by lower income related to changes in the fair value of a million interest rate swap  which generated only million of income for the fiscal year ended august  as compared to million of income for the fiscal year ended august  provision for income taxes 
the company s effective income tax rate was for the fiscal year ended august  and for the fiscal year ended august  this decrease is due to a million credit that the company recorded in fiscal related to the reversal of tax reserves that were no longer required as well as changes in the provision required for foreign taxes 
fiscal year ended august  compared with fiscal year ended august  revenues in  revenues increased to million as compared with million for the increase can be attributed to acquisitions related to us and canadian rental and cleaning and related to first aid  primarily textilease  as well as growth in existing operations of 
this increase in existing operations was primarily due to revenue growth in the industrial laundry operations which accounted for of the increase 
the increase in revenue due to price increases was modest due to a particularly competitive pricing environment 
operating costs 
operating costs increased to million for as compared with million for as a percentage of revenues  operating costs increased to from for these periods  primarily due to significantly higher energy costs associated with operating industrial and specialty garments laundries as well as our fleet of delivery vehicles 
also  the textilease industrial laundries  acquired in the first quarter of  generally have higher production costs than the existing unifirst facilities 
the increase in operating costs is also attributable to the company s closure of a redundant facility during the fiscal year ended august  in connection with its plans to integrate the operations of textilease  the company closed its richmond plant and transferred the operations or the processing of garments to the richmond plant acquired from textilease 
all costs incurred with the closure of the unifirst richmond plant  except the costs associated with the write down to estimated fair value of certain machinery and equipment which is included in depreciation and amortization  have been recorded as operating costs during the fiscal year ended august  the company also experienced an overall increase in merchandise costs due to high merchandise amortization recognized for the industrial laundry locations acquired in the textilease acquisition 
this increase in merchandise amortization was partially offset as a result of cost savings realized in mfg as well as improved garment utilization in us and canadian rental and cleaning 
in addition  the company s operating costs increased as a percentage of revenues due to costs recorded in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal totaling related to the decommissioning of one of the facilities of specialty garments 
selling and administrative expenses 
the company s selling and administrative expenses increased to million  or of revenues  for as compared with million  or of revenues  for the decline in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue is due to lower commissions and other selling costs as a result of a decrease in new sales generated by us and canadian rental and cleaning during the fiscal year ended august  as compared to the fiscal year ended august  the company has also begun to realize synergies in us and canadian rental and cleaning from eliminating redundancies within the sales group from the acquisition of textilease 
the decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue is partially offset by the continuing rise of health care costs 
depreciation and amortization 
the company s depreciation and amortization expense increased to million  or of revenues  for  as compared with million  or of revenues  for the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily related to the depreciation and amortization on the tangible and intangible assets acquired from textilease in us and canadian rental and cleaning and first aid 
the company also recorded approximately million in depreciation expense during the quarter ended may  related to the write down  to estimated fair value  of certain machinery and equipment at unifirst richmond 
income from operations 
the company s income from operations increased million to million for the year ended august  as compared with million for the year ended august  this increase is primarily due to an increase in income from operations during these periods of million in us and canadian rental and cleaning  million in mfg  net of intercompany mfg elimination and million in first aid  offset by an increase in loss from operations of million in corporate and lower income from operations of million in specialty garments 
the increase in us and canadian rental and cleaning income from operations is due to increased revenues offset by higher operating costs and higher selling and administrative costs 
the reasons for these fluctuations in revenues and cost are primarily related to the textilease acquisition and other factors discussed above 
the increase in income from operations in first aid is due to a significant increase in revenues related to the acquisition of textilease 
the increase in the loss from operations in corporate is due primarily to increased payroll and other costs related to the company s distribution center and corporate offices as a result of the textilease acquisition 
the decrease in income from operations in specialty garments is due to minimal revenue growth offset by higher costs as a percentage of revenues 
a large portion of this increase in costs is due to the of costs related to the decommissioning of one of the facilities discussed above  increased depreciation expense  as well as higher other selling and administrative and payroll related costs 
other expense income 
other expense income interest expense  interest rate swap expense income and interest income was million  or of revenues  for  as compared with million  or of revenues  for the increase in other expense income was a result of the increased interest expense  which includes amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately million associated with debt financing obtained in connection with the acquisition of textilease 
this is somewhat offset by an increase in the fair value of a million interest rate swap  which generated million of income for the fiscal year ended august   compared to million of income for the fiscal year ended august  provision for income taxes

general 
for the fiscal year ended august   the company had a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of million 
the company completed the fiscal year ended august  with cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million 
the company believes that current cash and cash equivalent balances  cash generated from operations and amounts available under the company s amended credit agreement as defined below will be sufficient to meet the company s anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
sources and uses of cash 
during the fiscal year ended august   the company generated cash primarily from operating activities 
the company s operating activities provided net cash of million  resulting primarily from net income of million  amounts charged for depreciation and amortization of million  increases in accounts payable and accruals of million  a net decrease in inventories of million  offset primarily by an increase in accounts receivable of million  an increase in rental merchandise in service of million  and a decrease in accrued and deferred income taxes of million 
the company used its cash to  among other things  fund the acquisitions of businesses with an aggregate net purchase price of approximately million  fund million in capital expenditures to expand and update the company s facilities  reduce its debt by million  and pay approximately million in cash dividends to common and class b common shareholders 
additional cash resources 
in connection with the purchase of textilease  the company entered into a million unsecured revolving credit agreement the credit agreement  with a syndicate of banks 
the credit agreement replaced the company s previous million unsecured revolving credit agreement and  prior to its amendment  was due on the third anniversary of the closing date september  
on june   the company issued million of fixed and floating rate notes pursuant to a note purchase agreement note agreement 
under the note agreement  the company issued million of notes with a seven year term bearing interest at fixed rate notes 
the company also issued million of floating rate notes due in ten years floating rate notes 
of the floating rate notes  million bear interest at libor plus basis points and may be repaid at face value two years from the date they were issued 
the remaining million of floating rate notes bear interest at libor plus basis points and can be repaid at face value after one year 
the company also amended its credit agreement amended credit agreement to  among other things  reduce the amount available for borrowing thereunder to million and to reduce interest rates payable on such borrowings 
as amended  loans under the amended credit agreement bear interest at floating rates which vary based on the company s funded debt ratio 
the proceeds from the fixed rate notes and the floating rate notes were used to repay borrowings under the credit agreement 
at august   the interest rates applicable to the company s borrowings under the amended credit agreement ranged from libor plus basis points  or  to the prime rate  or 
the amended credit agreement expires on september  as of august   the maximum line of credit was million of which approximately million was available for borrowing thereunder 
as of such date  the company had outstanding borrowings of million and letters of credit of million 
under the amended credit agreement  the company may borrow funds at variable interest rates based on the eurodollar rate or the bank s prime rate  as selected by the company 
availability of credit requires compliance with financial and other covenants  including minimum tangible net worth  maximum funded debt ratio  and minimum debt coverage  as defined in the amended credit agreement 
compliance with these financial covenants is tested on a fiscal quarterly basis 
under the most restrictive of these provisions  the company was required to maintain minimum consolidated tangible net worth of million as of august  as of august   the company was in compliance with all covenants under the note agreement and the amended credit agreement 
commitments and contingencies the company and its operations are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations governing  among other things  the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes and other substances 
in particular  industrial laundries use and must dispose of detergent waste water and other residues 
the company is attentive to the environmental concerns surrounding the disposal of these materials and has  through the years  taken measures to avoid their improper disposal 
in the past  the company has settled  or contributed to the settlement of  actions or claims brought against the company relating to the disposal of hazardous materials and there can be no assurance that the company will not have to expend material amounts to remediate the consequences of any such disposal in the future 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability  as well as the amount to be recorded 
the company regularly consults with attorneys and outside consultants to ensure that all of the relevant facts and circumstances are considered  before a contingent liability is recorded 
changes in enacted laws  regulatory orders or decrees  management s estimates of costs  insurance proceeds  participation by other parties  the timing of payments and the input of outside consultants and attorneys based on changing legal or factual circumstances could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for environmental and other contingent liabilities 
under environmental laws  an owner or lessee of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on  or in  or emanating from such property  as well as related costs of investigation and property damage 
such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or lessee knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances 
there can be no assurances that acquired or leased locations have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations or that future uses or conditions will not result in the imposition of liability upon the company under such laws or expose the company to third party actions such as tort suits 
the company continues to address environmental conditions under terms of consent orders negotiated with the applicable environmental authorities or otherwise with respect to sites located in or related to woburn  massachusetts  uvalde  texas  springfield  massachusetts  stockton  california  and three sites related to former operations in williamstown  vermont 
in addition  the company is investigating the extent of environmental contamination and potential exposure at sites it acquired in connection with its acquisition of textilease  and it is defending against claims concerning alleged environmental conditions with respect to a site once owned by a former subsidiary in somerville  massachusetts 
the company has accrued certain costs related to the sites described above as it has been determined that the costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the company also has potential exposure related to an additional parcel of land the central area related to the woburn  massachusetts site discussed above 
currently  the consent order for the woburn  massachusetts site discussed above does not define or require any remediation work in the central area 
the company has not accrued for this contingency as the company believes  at this time  the liability is not probable and the amount of such contingent liability can not be reasonably estimated 
we routinely review and evaluate sites that may require remediation and monitoring and determine our estimated costs based on various estimates and assumptions 
these estimates are developed using our internal sources or by third party environmental engineers or other service providers 
internally developed estimates are based on management s judgment and experience in remediating and monitoring our sites  information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation and monitoring  the number  financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other potentially responsible parties prps who may be liable for remediation and monitoring of a specific site  and the typical allocation of costs among prps 
there is usually a range of reasonable estimates of the costs associated with each site 
we generally use the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate
