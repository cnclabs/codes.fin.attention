item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements and factors affecting future earnings herein 
disposition of geppeddo seasonal kiosk operations during  the company acquired the net assets of axis corporation  a privately held designer  importer and specialty retailer based in salt lake city  utah 
the acquired business sold dolls and doll accessories under the brand name of geppeddo at kiosks located in major shopping centers throughout the united states during the peak holiday shopping season 
the original strategy behind the geppeddo acquisition was to give the company additional differentiated and branded products and access to a new channel of distribution 
however  since the acquisition  the demand for porcelain dolls declined substantially 
this softening combined with significantly reduced traffic at the kiosks resulted in a business model that the company did not believe could be profitable going forward 
as a result  in december  the company committed to a plan to cease operations of geppeddo 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company recorded geppeddo s results in continuing operations in and until the run off of operations was completed in the second quarter of upon completion of the run off  the geppeddo results were reclassified into discontinued operations for all periods presented 
additional information regarding the disposition of the geppeddo seasonal kiosk operations is included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations beginning on page and note within the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f unless otherwise noted  the following discussion relates to operations excluding the discontinued geppeddo seasonal kiosk operations

the company s domestic wholesale operations serve an extensive base of retailers  primarily consisting of approximately  independent gift retailers across the us and canada who account for approximately of the company s wholesale sales the company refers to this portion of its customer base as its gift and specialty channel 
approximately  of the company s principal wholesale customers receive the company s village series and or snowbabies products which the company sometimes refers to as its collectible products and or lines 
these retailers include approximately  independently owned club sm  gold key sm and showcase sm dealers  who receive special recognition and qualify for improved sales terms by satisfying certain volume  merchandising and or promotional requirements 
approximately of the company s wholesale sales are made to department stores  select general merchandise chains  and mail order houses 
no single account represented more than of the company s wholesale sales in fiscal the company provides volume discounts to its customers on most of its products 
the company has generally had only limited sales outside the united states 
international wholesale sales  which are made primarily in canada  were approximately of the company s wholesale sales in fiscal over the past five years  the company s principal wholesale customers have decreased in number by approximately  or 
similarly  customers who sell the company s village series and or snowbabies products have decreased over the same period by approximately  or 
the company believes the decrease in customers and related decrease in sales since is a result of the overall weakness of the gift and specialty channel 
the company has enacted programs to curb the decline in customers and wholesale sales experienced over the past four years including implementing new customer ordering and shipping programs  strengthening its sales organization  refining its product development process  broadening the seasonal coverage of its product lines  and pursuing alternative channels of retail distribution 
management believes that some customer attrition is likely to continue within its core gift and specialty channel 
the company plans to continue to seek complementary retailers and to offer differentiated product to select general merchandise retail chains in order to augment revenue and to introduce more new consumers to the company s products 
the company continues to market and advertise its products to retailers principally through giftware trade shows  brochures and trade journals 
the company provides merchandising and product information to its customers distributing village and giftware products through its business to business internet site web information network sm or win sm 
win also provides ordering  order status information and other transaction processing capabilities to its subscribers 
the company markets to existing and potentially new consumers through brochures and point of sale information

departmentcom 
department maintains a toll free telephone line for collector and consumer questions and participates in collector conventions

retail operations the company sells its products to consumers through its retail operations  which in included six retail stores located in tourist destinations at mall of america  outside minneapolis  minnesota  aladdin hotel and casino in las vegas  nevada  downtown disney in anaheim  california  water tower place in chicago  illinois  florida mall in orlando  florida  and pier in san francisco  california  which opened in june the company s direct selling business  time to celebrate has been in operation since the second quarter of independent time to celebrate sales consultants  known as celebration specialists  who are not agents or employees of the company  market and distribute giftware and home decorative products to their customers principally through the home show method of direct sales 
a celebration specialist contacts consumers  selling primarily at home based shows using seasonal brochures and product samples 
the celebration specialist collects payment from the consumer at the time the consumer s order is submitted 
celebration specialists have access to a web based consultant care tool  allowing them to preview products  policies and procedures and to place and make payment against their orders 
orders are processed and the products are then delivered to the home show host 
the host then handles delivery of the merchandise to the consumer 
the celebration specialists are the customers of time to celebrate and the company generally has no transaction or arrangement with any end user of its product beyond the consultant 
celebration specialists are responsible for payment to the company upon or prior to shipment  whether or not the products are delivered to an end user 
typical characteristics of companies engaged in direct sales include a high rate of turnover among sales consultants  and a positive correlation between the number of sales consultants and revenue 
for these reasons  the recruiting and training of new time to celebrate celebration specialists is expected to be continually necessary 
the two primary means of obtaining new celebration specialists is by recruiting people who are themselves experienced with the home show sales format and through personal contacts resulting from home show activity 
all of the celebration specialists earn a margin on their own sales and are eligible to receive bonuses from sales by celebration specialists they have recruited 
this rewards program and development of sales leadership is an essential part of time to celebrate s long term growth strategy 
at the end of  there were approximately  time to celebrate independent celebration specialists located in states and located in canada

the company continues to build its general giftware business by developing new product lines and signing license agreements with nationally recognized artists 
design and production each year  the company introduces new products in its existing product lines and also develops entirely new design and product concepts 
the design and manufacture of the company s products are complex processes 
the path from initial conception of the design idea to market introduction generally takes six to months  although the company continues to investigate processes intended to reduce this time 
the company s village series products are principally composed of ceramic and porcelain clays  and the company s other products are designed in a variety of media  including ceramic and porcelain clays  as well as paper mach  acrylic  resin and fabric 
the company continues to add licensed trademarks and characters to its village and snowbabies lines

department believes that its relationships with its manufacturers  and the quality of their craftsmanship  provide a competitive advantage and are a significant contributor to the company s success 
the company imports most of its products from the pacific rim  primarily the people s republic of china and the philippines 
the company also imports a small percentage of its products from india and europe 
during fiscal  the company imported products from approximately independent manufacturing sources  some of which are represented by independent trading companies 
the company s single largest manufacturing source represented approximately of the company s imports in fiscal the company s emphasis on high quality craftsmanship at affordable prices limits the sources from which the company chooses to obtain products 
the company has long standing relationships with the majority of its manufacturers several for years or more and may purchase  typically on a year to year basis  a substantial portion of a manufacturer s entire annual output 
as a result of these relationships  the company has experienced a low turnover of its manufacturing sources 
distribution and systems the products sold by the company to its company owned retail stores  its retail customers  and the time to celebrate celebration specialists in the us are generally shipped by ocean freight from abroad and then by rail to the company s distribution center located in the minneapolis st 
paul metropolitan area

the company also uses handheld optical scanners and bar coded labels in accepting orders at wholesale showrooms and in the field throughout the us and canada 
these systems also provide a range of order and product information and ordering capabilities to customers subscribing to its win business to business site and to time to celebrate celebration specialists 
the company s retail systems also monitor and transmit to the company on a daily basis the pos point of sales data for the company s owned retail stores 
backlog and seasonality the company receives products  pays its suppliers and ships products throughout the year  although historically the majority of shipments have occurred in the second and third quarters of each year as retailers stock merchandise in anticipation of the winter holiday season 
the company continues to ship wholesale merchandise until mid december each year 
accordingly  the company s wholesale backlog typically is lowest at the beginning of january 
as of january   department had unfilled wholesale orders of approximately million compared to million at january  the entire backlog is scheduled to be shipped to customers during the fiscal year 
approximately to of the company s total annual wholesale customer orders have been cancelled in each of the last three years for a number of reasons  primarily customer credit considerations and inventory stock outs 
historically  due to the timing of wholesale trade shows early in the calendar year  the company has received the majority of its total annual wholesale customer orders during the first quarter of each year 
during the first quarter of each of the past three years  the company has received approximately to of its annual wholesale orders for such years 
the company can experience fluctuations in quarterly sales due to the timing of receipt of product from suppliers and subsequent shipment of product from the company to customers  as well as the timing of orders placed by customers 
as a result of the company s sales pattern  the company has historically recorded a substantial portion of its wholesale revenues in its second and third quarters  and the majority of its store based retail and time to celebrate sales occur in the fourth quarter during the peak holiday shopping season 
the extended payment terms that the company provides to many of its wholesale customers create a significant seasonal pattern in its working capital requirements 
due to the seasonal pattern of shipping and accounts receivable collection  the company generally has greater working capital needs in its second and third quarters and experiences greater cash availability in its first and fourth quarters 
the cash from the company s retail operations is also generated predominantly in the fourth quarter 
the company typically finances its operations through cash and marketable securities balances  internally generated cash flow and short term seasonal borrowings

the company has historically renewed its registered trademarks and expects to continue to renew them as business needs dictate 
competition department competes generally for the discretionary income of consumers with other producers of collectibles  specialty giftware and home decorative accessory products 
the collectibles area  in particular  is affected by changing consumer tastes and interests 
the giftware industry is highly competitive  with a large number of both large and small participants 
the company s competitors distribute their products through their company owned retail stores  independent gift retailers  department stores  mass market and specialty chain stores  televised home shopping networks  internet commerce and mail order houses  and through the home show sales method or other direct response marketing methods 
the company believes that the principal elements of competition in the specialty giftware industry are brand loyalty  design  quality  display and price 
the company believes that its competitive position is enhanced by a variety of factors  including the uniqueness  quality and enduring themes of the company s products  its reputation among retailers and consumers  its in house design expertise  its sourcing and marketing capabilities  and the pricing of its products 
imports the company does not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and imports most of its products from manufacturers in the pacific rim  primarily the people s republic of china china and the philippines 
the company also imports a small percentage of its products from sources in india and europe 
the company s ability to import products and thereby satisfy customer orders is affected by the availability of  and demand for  quality production capacity abroad 
the company competes with other importers of specialty giftware products for the limited number of foreign manufacturing sources that can produce detailed  high quality products at affordable prices 
foreign manufacturing and procurement of imports is subject to the following inherent risks labor  economic and political instability  cost and capacity fluctuations and delays in transportation  dockage and materials handling  restrictive actions by governments  nationalizations  the laws and policies of the us affecting importation of goods including duties  quota and taxes  international political military terrorist developments  and foreign trade and tax laws 
moreover  the company cannot predict what relevant political  legal or regulatory changes may occur  or the type or amount of any financial impact on the company such changes may have in the future 
fluctuations in currency exchange also present risk inherent in the company s method for inventory procurement 
the company s costs could be adversely affected if the currencies of other countries in which the company sources product appreciate significantly relative to the us dollar  this could result  for example  from a decision by china to allow its currency to float instead of being pegged to the us dollar at a fixed rate 
the company s products are subject to customs duties and regulations pertaining to the importation of goods  including requirements for the marking of certain information regarding the country of origin on the company s products 
in its ordinary course of business  the company may be involved in disputes with the us bureau of customs and border protection us customs regarding the amount of duty to be paid  the value of merchandise to be reported or other customs regulations relating to certain of the company s imports  which may result in the payment of additional duties and or penalties  or which may result in the refund of duties to the company 
since the terrorist attacks of september   us customs has enacted various security protocols affecting the importation of goods 
such protocols could adversely affect the speed or cost involved in the company s receipt of inventory from its overseas vendors 
in fiscal  approximately of the company s imports were manufactured in china  and the company anticipates that such percentage will hold constant or increase for the foreseeable future 
china has joined the world trade organization and been accorded permanent normal trade relations status by the us government 
however  various commercial and legal practices widespread in china  including the handling of intellectual properties and certain labor practices  as well as certain political and military actions taken or suggested by china  are under review by the us government 
china  moreover  has been designated a country of particular concern cpc pursuant to the international religious freedom act of irfa 
the irfa enumerates several specific retaliatory actions that may be taken by the us government  none of which the company believes would have a material impact on its business 
the irfa  however  also accords the president broad discretion in fashioning other or additional actions and  due to the breadth of the presidential powers under the irfa  the company is unable to predict what  if any  action the president could take in the future 
accordingly  the ability to continue to conduct business with vendors located in china is subject to political uncertainties  the financial impact of which the company is unable to estimate 
to the extent china may have its exports or transaction of business with us persons subject to political retaliation  the cost of chinese imports could increase significantly and or the ability to import goods from china may be materially impaired 
in such an event  there could be an adverse effect on the company until alternative arrangements for the manufacture of its products were obtained on economic  production and operational terms at least as favorable as those currently in effect

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in millions  except per share amounts strategic overview the company s financial results for as well as for the prior two years were significantly impacted by fundamental changes occurring in our core gift and specialty account base 
we continue to see substantial attrition in the gift and specialty channel  which accounted for over of the company s wholesale sales in in addition to account attrition  on going accounts have been very cautious in ordering the company s village product 
largely due to this account attrition and the cautious buying of village product from existing gift and specialty dealers  village product revenue decreased in which is consistent with a longer term trend 
see five year village sales trend at item selected financial data five year summary 
in response to the changing nature of the gift and specialty channel  in particular how it has impacted the company s core village business  the company has continued to develop and implement a number of growth strategies designed to offset the impact of the decline in the gift and specialty channel and to grow both revenue and earnings in the long term 
a summary of these strategies follows developing year round celebratory products the company has repositioned itself from a strong christmas collectibles business to a company providing premier home decorative products to celebrate life s extraordinary moments 
the company has expanded its village lines to incorporate celebrations of all major holidays  special moments and seasons 
this re positioning strategy has also led to a strengthening  broadening and increased focus on the company s giftware line with the goal of developing cohesive  multi season product lines that will attract consumers year round 
while further progress needs to be made  the company s giftware sales have demonstrated positive results 
the company s giftware sales  excluding its figurine business  increased and during and  respectively 
expand multi channels of distribution the continuing challenges with its core gift and specialty channel has led the company to participate in more wholesale and direct channels of distribution in an effort to reach a broader base of consumers and take advantage of how and where consumers shop today 
the company has three strategic initiatives which it is pursuing department retail the company s initial retail strategy has been to build flagship stores showcasing the breadth of its product in high traffic locations which enjoy a balanced mix of tourist and local population traffic  and where there is no significant wholesale distribution 
the company s retail stores have been profitable during the past three years 
during  the company opened a new store in san francisco and currently operates six stores in total 
the company plans to open another store during the latter half of  although an appropriate site currently has not yet been identified 
wholesale channels although the gift and specialty channel will continue to be the company s core channel of distribution  the company has adopted a multi wholesale channel approach to better expose its products and make them more accessible to a broader range of consumers 
new  simpler and less costly village as well as giftware lines are being offered to select general merchandise chains as well as select specialty retail chains 
the company plans to continue to pursue new accounts and deepen penetration in its current accounts where an opportunity exists to provide value to the consumer through branded offerings 
time to celebrate launched during  time to celebrate is the company s direct sales business 
time to celebrate uses independent celebration specialists to market and sell its products directly to the consumer at parties held by a host  generally in the host s own home  with consumers the host has invited 
at the end of  time to celebrate had approximately  celebration specialists 
management believes this channel can add significant revenue in the future and provides an opportunity to interact closely with our time to celebrate customers on a long term basis 
leverage and grow our core consumer base the company is fortunate to have long enjoyed a strong consumer following for its core brands 
it is our intention to forge closer links with this group and augment it with the consumers shopping at department retail and time to celebrate as well as those consumers who visit us at www

this recovery resulted in other income of million and a million reduction in net depreciable assets 
provision for income taxes the effective income tax rate was and during and  respectively 
the lower effective income tax rate in was due to a million reversal of prior year tax accruals that were no longer needed 
excluding this reversal  the effective income tax rate was in seasonality historically  due to the timing of wholesale trade shows early in the calendar year  the company has received the majority of its total annual wholesale customer orders during the first quarter of each year 
the company entered and of its total net annual wholesale customer orders during the first quarter of and  respectively 
cancellations of total annual wholesale customer orders were in and in orders not shipped in a particular year  net of cancellations  are carried into backlog for the following year and have historically been orders for spring and easter products 
the company s backlog of wholesale customer orders was million and million at january  and january   respectively 
the company receives products  pays its suppliers and ships products throughout the year  although historically the majority of wholesale shipments occur in the second and third quarters as retailers stock merchandise in anticipation of the holiday season 
as a result of this seasonal pattern  the company generally records its highest wholesale sales during the second and third quarters of each year 
however  the company can experience fluctuations in quarterly sales and related net income compared with the prior year due to the timing of receipt of product from suppliers and subsequent shipment of product from the company to customers  as well as the timing of orders placed by customers 
in addition  the company recognizes the majority of its retail sales in the fourth quarter during the peak holiday shopping season 
the company is not managed to maximize quarter to quarter results  but rather to achieve annual objectives designed to achieve long term growth consistent with the company s business strategy

additionally  wholesale customer orders entered exclude orders from company operated retail stores 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operations net cash provided by operating activities decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease was principally due to lower cash collections  partially offset by lower payments for inventory 
cash collections were lower in principally due to lower net sales and higher accounts receivable balances at the end of the year 
accounts receivable balances were higher at the end of due to shipping product later in the year compared to and due to two less days of cash collections in as a result of the fiscal year ending on january  compared to the fiscal year ending on january  inventory payments were lower in due to the decrease in net sales 
accounts receivable  net of reserves  which principally consists of wholesale trade receivables  increased by  from million at january  to million at january  due to the reasons described above 
management believes there is adequate provision for any doubtful accounts receivable and product claims that may arise 
because the company s wholesale business is not capital intensive  the company has historically not incurred significant capital expenditures 
capital expenditures for the retail business were million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
other capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
sources of liquidity the company s primary source of cash is the funds generated from operations 
additionally  the company has a revolving credit facility available for working capital and investment needs as described below 
based on current levels of operations  the company believes its funds generated from operations  its available cash  and its revolving credit facility will be sufficient to finance any capital expenditures  contractual obligations or strategic initiatives in the foreseeable future 
the company s strategy includes the pursuit of a significant acquisition that aligns with and complements its existing business 
as a result  the company has accumulated cash to help finance a potential acquisition 
the company also has the ability to use its revolving credit facility to finance an acquisition 
however  depending on the size of the acquisition  the company may have to find additional financing to complete an acquisition 
in the event the company is not able to identify an acceptable acquisition by mid  the company intends to return cash to its stockholders 
consistent with customary practice in the giftware industry  the company offers extended accounts receivable terms to many of its wholesale customers 
this practice has typically created significant working capital requirements in the second and third quarters that the company has generally financed with seasonal borrowings under its revolving credit facility 
the company s cash and cash equivalents balances peak early in the first quarter of the subsequent year  following the collection of wholesale customer accounts receivable with extended payment terms and cash receipts from the company s retail operations 
in november  the company entered into a new three year credit agreement 
in connection therewith  the company recorded million in deferred financing fees  which are being amortized over the life of the credit agreement 
the company used the new credit facility to refinance the remaining term and revolving loans under its former credit agreement 
as of january   no revolving loans were outstanding under the new credit agreement 
the credit agreement expires november  the revolving credit facility provides for borrowings of up to million  which may be in the form of letters of credit and revolving credit loans 
the letters of credit are issued primarily in connection with inventory purchases 
the revolving credit facility includes an annual clean down provision whereby the company s outstanding revolving credit loans and letters of credit may not exceed an aggregate of million during any one consecutive day period beginning november and ending march of the following year 
borrowings under the credit agreement are subject to certain borrowing base limitations as defined in the agreement 
the company s borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility as of january  was million and will fluctuate during based on accounts receivable and inventory levels 
the revolving line of credit provides for commitment fees of to per annum on the daily average of the unused commitment 
the credit agreement allows the company to choose between two interest rate options in connection with its revolving credit loans 
the interest rate options are the floating rate as defined in the agreement or the eurodollar rate as defined in the agreement plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin ranges from to for floating rate loans and from to for eurodollar rate loans 
the credit agreement includes restrictions as to  among other things  the amount of additional indebtedness  liens  contingent obligations  investments and dividends 
under the most restrictive of these covenants  approximately million of retained earnings were restricted at january  the credit agreement also requires maintenance of minimum levels of interest coverage  net worth and maximum levels of leverage  in each case at the end of each fiscal quarter 
none of these restrictions are expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to operate in the future 
the company has pledged the common stock of certain of its subsidiaries  direct and indirect  as collateral under the credit agreement  and certain of its subsidiaries  direct and indirect  have guaranteed repayment of amounts borrowed under the credit agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations as of january   the company is obligated to make cash payments in connection with its operating leases  purchase obligations  and royalty guarantees in the amounts listed below 
the company does not have any long term debt or capital lease obligations 
the company has no off balance sheet debt or other unrecorded obligations other than the items noted in the following table in thousands payments due operating leases purchase commitments royalty guarantees total thereafter   the company is committed to pay suppliers of village and giftware product under the terms of open purchase orders issued in the normal course of business 
the company is committed to pay licensors under the terms of license agreements entered into in the normal course of business 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the company s deferred compensation obligation 
wholesale credit and return policies the company has credit policies that establish specific criteria related to creditworthiness that its customers must meet prior to the shipment of product to the customer 
the company periodically makes limited and selective exceptions to its policy of not shipping to customers with overdue balances when the particular customer has met specific criteria  which are indicative of a wherewithal and willingness to pay their past due and future balances 
the company does not accept returns from wholesale customers without its prior authorization 
returns are typically accepted only for damaged or defective goods  or shipping discrepancies 
the company reserves the right to refuse authorization of any returns and to discard any unauthorized returns 
if the company accepts an unauthorized return or if a return is the result of a customer error  the wholesale customer may be subject to a handling charge 
the company reserves the right to cancel open orders or backorders for those wholesale customers who abuse or excessively use return privileges 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the united states 
in connection with the preparation of the financial statements  we are required to make assumptions  make estimates and apply judgment that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and related disclosures 
the company bases its assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
on a regular basis  management reviews the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
management believes the following critical accounting policies require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and are therefore particularly important to an understanding of our results of operations and financial position sales returns and credits an allowance is established for credits related to possible returned or damaged product  pricing and shipping discrepancies 
the amount of the allowance is based on historical ratios of credits to sales  the historical average length of time between the sale and the credit  and other factors 
changes in customers behavior versus historical experience  changes in product damage or defect rates  or changes in the company s return policies are among the factors that would result in materially different amounts for this item 
based on sales returns and credits  a increase or decrease in sales returns and credits would have had an impact of approximately million 
inventory valuation inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
the amount is determined by analyzing historical and projected sales information  plans for discontinued products and other factors 
the company procures product based on forecasted sales volume 
if actual sales were significantly lower than forecasted sales due to unexpected economic or competitive conditions  it could result in materially higher surplus and discontinued inventories 
based on inventory write downs  a increase or decrease in inventory write downs would have had an impact of less than million 
allowance for doubtful accounts an allowance is established for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable 
the required allowance is determined by reviewing each significant customer account and making estimates of amounts that may be uncollectible 
factors considered in determining the amount of the reserve include the age of the receivable  the financial condition of the customer  general business  economic and political conditions  and other relevant facts and circumstances 
additionally  since the majority of the company s wholesale sales have dating terms which come due in november and december  the company does not have visibility into overdue balances for most of its wholesale customers until the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 
due to the seasonality of the company s business  the extended dating terms provided to customers and the relative size of accounts receivable balances at year end  it is not uncommon for the company to experience fluctuations in the provision for bad debt expense from quarter to quarter as the company refines its estimate 
unexpected changes in the aforementioned factors would result in materially different amounts for this item 
in addition  results could be materially different if economic conditions worsened for the company s customers 
based on bad debt write offs  a increase or decrease in bad debt write offs would have had an impact of less than million 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets on the company s consolidated balance sheet consist primarily of property and equipment 
the company periodically reviews the carrying value of these assets based  in part  upon projections of anticipated undiscounted cash flows 
management undertakes this review when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from those assets may be diminished 
any impairment charge recorded reduces earnings 
while the company believes future estimates are reasonable  different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets the company operates could affect evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets 
valuation of goodwill  trademarks and other intangible assets the company evaluates goodwill  trademarks and other intangible assets on a periodic basis 
this evaluation relies on assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or related assumptions change  the company may be required to recognize impairment charges 
effective at the beginning of fiscal year  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment annually 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 the company performed impairment testing and concluded that goodwill related to the wholesale operating segment was impaired and recorded a million charge to write down its goodwill 
this impairment was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and therefore did not impact fiscal operating income 
additionally  the company determined that its trademarks are indefinite lived intangible assets and ceased amortization 
intangible assets associated with non compete agreements are amortized over the life of the agreement and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company completed its impairment analyses for and found no indication of impairment of its recorded goodwill  trademarks and other intangible assets 
additional write downs of intangible assets may be required if future valuations do not support current carrying value 
tax contingencies the company is periodically contacted or audited by federal and state tax authorities 
these contacts or audits include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions  the company records a reserve for estimated probable exposures 
the estimate of this reserve contains uncertainty because management must use judgment to estimate the exposure associated with its various filing positions 
to the extent the company does not have to pay taxes for which reserves have been established or is required to pay amounts in excess of its reserves  the company s tax rate in a given financial period could be materially impacted 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements regarding discussion of new accounting standards 
foreign exchange approximately of the company s sales in were denominated in united states dollars and  as a result  were not subject to changes in exchange rates 
approximately of the company s sales were denominated in foreign currencies that were subject to changes in exchange rates 
at this time  the company does not use derivative instruments to manage the exchange rate risk 
the company imports its product from manufacturers located in the pacific rim  principally china 
although the company generally pays for its product in united states dollars  the cost of such product may fluctuate with the value of the chinese currency because the purchase price paid to the company s vendors in united states dollars would be worth more or less in the chinese currency 
as a result  the company s costs could be adversely affected if the chinese currency appreciates significantly relative to the united states dollar  this could result from a decision by the people s republic of china to allow its currency to float instead of being pegged to the us dollar at a fixed rate 
conversely  the company s costs would be favorably affected if the chinese currency depreciates significantly relative to the united states dollar 
in addition  less than of the company s product purchases in were denominated in foreign currencies that were subject to changes in exchange rates 
during  the company did not use derivative instruments to manage the exchange rate risk

effect of inflation the company continually attempts to minimize any effect of inflation on earnings by controlling its operating costs and selling prices 
during the past few years  the rate of inflation has been low and has not had a material impact on the company s results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion of the company s exposure to market risk contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the information presented has been prepared utilizing certain assumptions considered reasonable in light of information currently available to management 
given the unpredictability of interest rates as well as other factors  actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward looking information 
the company s market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
the first component of the company s interest rate risk relates to its debt outstanding 
the company s credit facility bears interest at variable rates 
because this facility carries a variable interest rate  the company s results of operations and cash flows will be exposed to changes in interest rates 
based on average borrowings in  a increase or decrease in current market interest rates would have an impact of approximately million 
the second component of the company s interest rate risk involves the short term investment of excess cash 
excess cash flow is typically invested in high quality fixed income securities issued by banks  corporations and the us government  municipal securities  and overnight repurchase agreements backed by us government securities 
these securities are classified as cash equivalents on the company s balance sheet 
at january   the company s cash balance was approximately million 
earnings from cash equivalents were approximately million for the fifty two weeks ended january  based on the january  cash balance  a increase or decrease in current market interest rates would have an impact of approximately million 
approximately of the company s wholesale sales and less than of the company s product purchases in fiscal year were denominated in a foreign currency 
based on these sales and product purchases  a increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates would have an impact of less than million
