application of critical accounting estimates and policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates such estimates and judgments and makes adjustments as deemed necessary 
actual results could differ from these estimates using different estimates and assumptions  or if conditions are significantly different in the future 
listed below are those estimates that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale of a home is recognized when the closing has occurred  title has passed and an adequate initial and continuing investment by the homebuyer is received  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate sfas  or when the loan has been sold to a third party investor 
revenue for homes that close to the buyer having a deposit of or greater  and all home closings insured under fha or va government insured programs  are recorded in the financial statements on the date of closing 
revenue related to all other home closings is recorded on the date that m i financial sells the loan to a third party investor  because the receivable from the third party investor is not subject to future subordination and the company has transferred to this investor the usual risks and rewards of ownership that is in substance a sale and does not have a substantial continuing involvement with the home  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas 
all associated homebuilding costs are charged to cost of sales in the period when the revenues from home closings are recognized 
homebuilding costs include land and land development costs  home construction costs including an estimate of the costs to complete construction  previously capitalized indirect costs and estimated warranty costs 
all other costs are expensed as incurred 
we recognize the majority of the revenue associated with our mortgage loan operations when the mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to third party investors 
we defer the application and origination fees  net of costs  and recognize them as revenue  along with the associated gains or losses on the sale of the loans and related servicing rights  when the loans are sold to third party investors in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans 
the revenue recognized is reduced by the fair value of the related guarantee provided to the investor 
the guarantee fair value is recognized in revenue when the company is released from its obligation under the guarantee 
generally  all of the financial services mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to third party investors within two weeks of origination 
we recognize financial services revenue associated with our title operations as homes are closed  closing services are rendered and title policies are issued  all of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed 
all of the underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies is transferred to third party insurers 
inventories 
we use the specific identification method for the purpose of accumulating costs associated with home construction 
inventories are recorded at cost  unless they are determined to be impaired  in which case the impaired inventories are written down to fair value less cost to sell in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in addition to the costs of direct land acquisition  land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred and home construction costs  inventories include capitalized interest  real estate taxes and certain indirect costs incurred during land development and home construction 
such costs are charged to cost of sales simultaneously with revenue recognition  as discussed above 
when a home is closed  we typically have not yet paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home 
as homes close  we compare the home construction budget to actual recorded costs to date to estimate the additional costs to be incurred from our subcontractors related to the home 
we record a liability and a corresponding charge to cost of sales for the amount we estimate will ultimately be paid related to that home 
we monitor the accuracy of such estimate by comparing actual costs incurred in subsequent months to the estimate 
although actual costs to complete in the future could differ from the estimate  our method has historically produced consistently accurate estimates of actual costs to complete closed homes 
guarantees and indemnities 
guarantee and indemnity liabilities are established by charging the applicable income statement or balance sheet line  depending on the nature of the guarantee or indemnity  and crediting a liability 
the company generally provides a limited life guarantee on all loans sold to a third party  and estimates its actual liability related to the guarantee  and any indemnities subsequently provided to the purchaser of the loans in lieu of loan repurchase  based on historical loss experience 
actual future costs associated with loans guaranteed or indemnified could differ materially from our current estimated amounts 
warranty 
warranty liabilities are established by charging cost of sales and crediting a warranty liability for each home closed 
the amounts charged are estimated by management to be adequate to cover expected warranty related costs for materials and third party labor required under the company s warranty programs 
reserves for warranties under our two year limited warranty program and our year pre and year structural warranty program are established as a percentage of average sales price and on a per unit basis  respectively  and are based upon historical experience by geographic area and recent trends 
factors that are given consideration in determining the reserves include the historical range of amounts paid per average sales price on a home  type and mix of amenity packages added to the home  any warranty expenditures included in the above not considered to be normal and recurring  timing of payments  improvements in quality of construction expected to impact future warranty expenditures  actuarial estimates prepared by an independent third party  which considers both company and industry data  and conditions that may affect certain projects and require a higher percentage of average sales price for those specific projects 
changes in estimates for pre existing warranties occur due to changes in the historical payment experience  and are also due to differences between the actual payment pattern experienced during the period and the historical payment pattern used in our evaluation of the warranty reserve balance at the end of each quarter 
actual future warranty costs could differ materially from our currently estimated amount 
self insurance 
self insurance accruals are made for estimated liabilities associated with employee health care  ohio workers compensation and general liability insurance 
our self insurance limit for employee health care is  per claim per year for fiscal with stop loss insurance covering amounts in excess of the  up to  per claim per year 
for fiscal  the per claim limit has been raised to  and the stop loss insurance coverage has been increased to  per claim per year 
our self insurance limit for workers compensation is  per claim with stop loss insurance covering all amounts in excess of this limit 
the accruals related to employee health care and workers compensation are based on historical experience and open cases 
our general liability claims are insured by a third party  the company generally has a million deductible per occurrence and in the aggregate  with lower deductibles for certain types of claims 
the company records a general liability accrual for claims falling below the company s deductible 
the general liability accrual estimate is based on an actuarial evaluation of our past history of claims and other industry specific factors 
the company has recorded expenses totaling million  million and million for all self insured and general liability claims during the years ended december   and  respectively 
because of the high degree of judgment required in determining these estimated accrual amounts  actual future costs could differ from our current estimated amounts 
derivative financial instruments 
the company has the following types of derivative financial instruments mortgage loans held for sale  interest rate lock commitments and interest rate swaps 
mortgage loans held for sale consist primarily of single family residential loans collateralized by the underlying property 
all mortgage loans are committed to third party investors at the date of funding and are typically sold to such investors within two weeks of funding 
the commitments associated with funded loans are designated as fair value hedges of the risk of changes in the overall fair value of the related loans 
accordingly  changes in the value of derivative instruments are recognized in current earnings  as are changes in the value of the loans 
the net gains or losses are included in financial services revenue 
to meet financing needs of our home buying customers  m i financial is party to interest rate lock commitments irlcs  which are extended to customers who have applied for a mortgage loan and meet certain defined credit and underwriting criteria 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas and related derivatives implementation group conclusions  the company classifies and accounts for irlcs as non designated derivative instruments at fair value with gains and losses recorded in current earnings 
m i financial manages interest rate risk related to its irlc loans through the use of forward sales of mortgage backed securities fmbs  use of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments and the occasional purchase of options on fmbs in accordance with company policy 
these instruments are considered non designated derivatives and are accounted for at fair value with gains or losses recorded in current earnings 
sfas requires interest rate swaps to be recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
changes in their value are recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
the fair value of the company s interest rate swaps  which expired during the third quarter of  was recorded in other liabilities and the change in their fair value is recorded in general and administrative expense 
results of operations the company s chief operating decision maker evaluates the company s performance on a consolidated basis and by evaluating our two segments  homebuilding operations and financial services operations 
the homebuilding operations include the development of land  the sale and construction of single family attached and detached homes and the occasional sale of lots to third parties 
the homebuilding operations include similar operations in several geographic regions that have been aggregated for segment reporting purposes 
the financial services operations include the origination and sale of mortgage loans and title services for purchasers of the company s homes 
in conformity with sfas no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information  the company s segment information is presented on the basis that the chief operating decision maker uses in evaluating segment performance 
the accounting policies of the segments  in total  are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies included in note of our consolidated financial statements 
intersegment revenue primarily represents the elimination of revenue included in financial services for fees paid by the homebuilding operations relating to loan origination fees for its homebuyers and the reclassification of certain amounts from internal reporting classifications to proper presentation in conformity with gaap 
homebuilding income before income taxes includes an interest charge on the company s net investment in the segment using an interest rate of for housing and for land  as well as an allocation for programs and services administered centrally 
a management decision was made for that this interest rate be reduced from for housing and for land used in and  to more closely reflect our actual costs  which results in a lower allocation of interest to homebuilding and  therefore  higher income before income taxes within the homebuilding segment 
the homebuilding segment s results also include fees paid to the financial services segment to lock in interest rates 
corporate and other income before income taxes includes selling  general and administrative costs that are viewed by management as not specifically related to either the homebuilding or financial services segment or are otherwise not charged to either segment for internal purposes  income resulting from the allocation of interest and other costs to those segments  the elimination of revenue and cost of sales between the homebuilding and financial services segments and adjustments necessary to reclassify certain amounts from internal reporting classifications to proper presentation in conformity with gaap 
highlights and trends for the year ended december  our revenue increase of over was driven by an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered along with a increase in the number of homes delivered  we continue to see increases year over year in the average sales price of homes delivered in all of our markets  however  we anticipate that the rate of increase in our midwest markets will slow in in  approximately of our operating income was derived from operations in our columbus market 
we anticipate that this percentage will decline in as a higher percentage of our homes delivered are expected in markets outside the columbus market 
income before taxes increase of over was driven by the revenue increase above combined with a slight improvement in homebuilding margins from to  resulting from additional house options being sold that carry higher margins along with cost efficiencies in land development 
additionally  our financial services operations generated million higher income than in  of which nearly million was the result of the increase in ownership of one of our title companies 
partially offsetting these increases were million higher warranty costs due mainly to a change in estimate for our year structural warranty  million of costs incurred relating to the florida hurricanes  million costs incurred for the early termination of our million senior subordinated notes  and million higher interest costs due to an increase in borrowings 
as a result of lower refinance volume for outside lenders and increased demand for arm loans  we expect to experience continued downward pressure on our mortgage company s capture rate 
this could negatively affect earnings due to the lower capture rate and lower margins 
we continue to focus on our land supply  and spent approximately million on land purchases during the year 
during  we also increased the amount of land held under option contract by million  an increase of 
we expect to purchase approximately million of land in  with approximately of those purchases being in markets outside the midwest  as we continue to increase our land position in those markets where we expect our future growth in new contracts to be generated 
as a result of regulatory delays in opening new communities during  we expect to incur a decline in our first quarter new contracts when compared to s first quarter 
we also anticipate the number of homes delivered in the first half of to be lower than the same period in  along with a decline in income 
however  as our number of new communities increase in the second half of  we anticipate an overall annual increase in our results 
we expect our and future earnings to be negatively impacted by a new accounting standard that will require us to record compensation expense for stock options issued to employees starting in the third quarter  however  we do not believe that the impact will be material to our and future results of operations 
we also anticipate a slightly lower effective tax rate for primarily as a result of the american jobs creation act 
highlights and trends for the year ended december  our revenue increase of over was driven by the increase in the average sales price of homes delivered with the number of homes delivered remaining almost constant from to income before taxes increase of over was driven by the revenue increase above combined with an improvement in homebuilding margins from to  resulting from additional house options being sold that carry higher margins along with the mix of homes delivered including more homes delivered in our higher margin markets compared to in addition  our increase in income before taxes also was attributable to the improvement in our financial services operations as a result of higher income from the sale of loans  primarily due to the higher percentage of fixed rate loans that generally result in higher profit when sold to a third party 
the consolidated results were also impacted by a million favorable market adjustment on our interest rate swaps in  which was million unfavorable in  these interest rate swaps expired during the third quarter of during  we spent approximately million on land purchases during the year  and continue to look for additional land in desirable locations to increase our community count 
we anticipated approximately annual growth in the number of new contracts once these new communities are opened

seasonality and variability in quarterly results we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  significant seasonality and quarter to quarter variability in homebuilding activity levels 
in general  homes delivered increase substantially in the third and fourth quarters 
we believe that this seasonality reflects the tendency of homebuyers to shop for a new home in the spring with the goal of closing in the fall or winter  as well as the scheduling of construction to accommodate seasonal weather conditions 
we also have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  seasonality in our financial services operations because loan originations correspond with the delivery of homes in our homebuilding operations 
the following table reflects this cycle for the company during the four quarters of and three months ended december  september  june  march  dollars in thousands revenue unit data new contracts homes delivered backlog at end of period three months ended december  september  june  march  dollars in thousands revenue a unit data new contracts homes delivered backlog at end of period a during  the company reclassified certain loan fee expenses previously included in general and administrative expenses to offset with the related loan fee income included in revenue

homes delivered represents homes for which the closing of the sale has occurred 
backlog represents homes for which the standard sales contract has been executed  but which are not included in homes delivered because closings for these homes have not yet occurred as of the end of the period specified 
most cancellations of contracts for homes in backlog occur because customers cannot qualify for financing and usually occur prior to the start of construction 
the cancellation rate was approximately in each of the years ended december   and unsold speculative homes  which are in various stages of construction  totaled  and at december   and  respectively 
during  the company increased its investment in unsold speculative homes  primarily in the midwest region  for competitive purposes and to provide potential homebuyers with more flexibility and the ability to see certain options in our homes 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
revenue for the homebuilding segment was billion  an increase of and million from this increase was due to a increase in housing revenue million  offset partially by a decrease in land revenue million 
the increase in housing revenue was primarily due to an increase of in the average sales price of homes delivered  from  in to  in  along with the increase in the number of homes delivered from  in to  in the average sales price of homes delivered increased in all of our markets  with the largest increases occurring in our florida region 
the number of homes delivered increased in all of our markets except indianapolis and tampa 
indianapolis was lower than due to the available communities consisting of some older less desirable communities that we were closing out  and tampa was lower than due to the impact of delays in land development and opening of new communities and general slowness of the building permit process 
the decrease in land revenue was primarily due to our exit from the phoenix market which had no outside lot sales in compared to million in reductions in land revenue totaling million occurred in our charlotte and raleigh markets due to the sell off of remaining lots in less desirable communities in partially offsetting these decreases was a million increase in washington  dc  where lots were sold in compared to lot in land revenue can vary significantly from year to year  given that management opportunistically determines the particular land or lots to be sold directly to third parties 
home sales and backlog 
new contracts in decreased over the prior year  from  to  new contracts decreased in our midwest ohio and indiana region  despite an increase in our cincinnati market  primarily due to higher mortgage rates  nominal job growth and regulatory delays in opening new communities 
we expect the midwest market conditions and the delays in opening new communities to also adversely affect sales in the midwest during the first half of when compared to the same period in new contracts increased in all of our other markets except tampa  with the largest increases occurring in our cincinnati  orlando and charlotte markets due to both the economic conditions in those markets and the availability of new subdivisions in exclusive or high demand locations 
the number of new contracts recorded in future periods will be dependent on numerous factors  including future economic conditions  timing of land acquisitions and development  consumer confidence  number of subdivisions and interest rates available to potential homebuyers 
at december   our backlog consisted of  homes  with an approximate sales value of million 
this represents a increase in units and a increase in sales value from december  the average sales price of homes in backlog increased by  with increases occurring in most of our markets 
this increase in the average sales price of homes in backlog is attributable partially to the overall increase in sales prices of our new contracts due to customers selecting more options  along with the mix of homes in backlog at the end of including more homes than the prior year end within our florida and washington  dc markets where our homes carry higher sales prices than in our midwest region

selling expenses 
selling expenses increased from million in to million in  however  selling expenses remained constant at of total revenue

interest income from allocations to homebuilding  net of interest incurred  was million higher in than in the increase was primarily the result of a million higher allocation of interest to the homebuilding segment  mainly resulting from the increase in homebuilding inventory

as of december   the company is authorized to repurchase an additional million of outstanding shares under the current repurchase program approved by the board of directors on december  our financing needs depend on sales volume  asset turnover  land acquisition and inventory balances

during  we intend to purchase approximately million of land  using cash generated from operations and our existing million line of credit that may be increased up to million as discussed below 
we continue to purchase some lots from outside developers under contracts 
however  we are strategically focusing on increasing raw ground purchases 
we will continue to evaluate all of our alternatives to satisfy our increasing demand for lots in the most cost effective manner 
our principal source of funds for construction and development activities has been from internally generated cash and from bank borrowings  which are primarily unsecured

d in connection with the development of certain of the company s communities  local government entities have been established and bonds have been issued by those entities to finance a portion of the related infrastructure 
community development district obligations represent obligations of the company as the current holder of the property  net of cash held by the district available to offset the particular bond obligations 
as of december   the company has recorded a liability of million relating to these community development district obligations  however  the actual cash payments that the company will ultimately make will be dependent upon the timing of the sale of those lots within the district to third parties 
refer to note of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these obligations 
e the company has obligations with certain sub contractors and suppliers of raw materials in the ordinary course of business to meet the commitments to deliver  homes that have an aggregate sales price of million 
based on our current housing gross margin of plus variable selling costs of of revenue  we estimate payments totaling approximately million to be made in relating to those homes 
off balance sheet arrangements our primary use of off balance sheet arrangements is for the purpose of securing the most desirable lots on which to build homes for our homebuyers in a manner that we believe reduces the overall risk to the company 
our off balance sheet arrangements relating to our homebuilding operations include joint ventures and limited liability companies  land option contracts and the issuance of letters of credit and completion bonds 
additionally  in the ordinary course of business  our financial services operations issue guarantees and indemnities relating to the sale of loans to third parties 
joint ventures and limited liability companies 
in the ordinary course of business  the company periodically enters into arrangements with third parties to acquire land and develop lots 
these arrangements include the creation by the company of joint ventures and limited liability companies  with the company s interest in these entities ranging from to 
the entities typically meet the criteria of variable interest entities  although one of our joint ventures does not meet the criteria of a variable interest entity because the equity at risk is sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated support from the equity investors 
we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entities  and our ownership in the other joint venture is not in excess of  therefore  our homebuilding joint ventures and limited liability companies are recorded using the equity method of accounting 
these entities engage in land development activities for the purpose of distributing developed lots to the company and its partners in the entity 
the company believes its maximum exposure related to any of these entities as of december  to be the amount invested of million plus our million share of letters of credit totaling million that serve as completion bonds for the development work in progress 
in  we anticipate entering into additional joint ventures in our higher growth  higher investment markets  in order to increase our land development activities in those markets  while sharing the risk with our partner in each respective entity 
in addition to our homebuilding joint ventures and limited liability companies  m i financial also owns a interest in one unconsolidated title insurance agency that engages in title and closing services for the company 
further details relating to our unconsolidated joint ventures and limited liability companies are included in note of our consolidated financial statements 
land option contracts 
in the ordinary course of business  the company enters into land option agreements in order to secure land for the construction of houses in the future 
pursuant to these land option agreements  the company will provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future  usually at predetermined prices 
because the entities holding the land under option often meet the criteria of being variable interest entities  the company evaluates all land option agreements to determine if it is necessary to consolidate any of these entities 
the company currently believes that its maximum exposure related to these contracts to be the amount of the company s outstanding deposits  which totaled million  including letters of credit of million and corporate promissory notes of million  as of december  further details relating to our land option contracts are included in note of our consolidated financial statements 
letters of credit and completion bonds 
the company provides standby letters of credit and completion bonds for development work in progress  deposits on land and lot purchase contracts and miscellaneous deposits 
as of december   the company had outstanding approximately million of completion bonds and standby letters of credit  including those related to joint ventures  limited liability companies and land option contracts discussed above 
guarantees and indemnities 
in the ordinary course of business  m i financial enters into agreements that guarantee purchasers of its mortgage loans that m i financial will repurchase a loan if certain conditions occur 
m i financial has also provided indemnifications to certain third party investors and insurers in lieu of repurchasing certain loans 
the risk associated with the guarantees and indemnities above is offset by the value of the underlying assets  and the company accrues its best estimate of the probable loss on these loans 
refer to note of our consolidated financial statement for additional details relating to our guarantees and indemnities 
interest rates and inflation our business is significantly affected by general economic conditions of the united states of america and  particularly  by the impact of interest rates 
higher interest rates may decrease our potential market by making it more difficult for homebuyers to qualify for mortgages or to obtain mortgages at interest rates that are acceptable to them 
the impact of increased rates can be offset  in part  by offering variable rate loans with lower interest rates 
in conjunction with our mortgage financing services  hedging methods are used to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations between the commitment date of the loan and the time the loan closes 
in recent years  we have generally been able to raise prices by amounts at least equal to our cost increases and  accordingly  have not experienced any detrimental effect from inflation 
when we develop lots for our own use  inflation may increase our profits because land costs are fixed well in advance of sales efforts 
we are generally able to maintain costs with subcontractors from the date construction is started on a home through the delivery date 
however  in certain situations  unanticipated costs may occur between the time of start and the delivery date  resulting in lower gross profit margins 
risk factors the following cautionary discussion of risks  uncertainties and possible inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business includes factors we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results 
other factors beyond those listed below  including factors unknown to us and factors known to us which we have not currently determined to be material  could also adversely affect us 
this discussion is provided as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of  and all our forward looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referenced in this section 
general real estate  economic and other conditions could adversely affect our business 
the homebuilding industry is significantly affected by changes in national and local economic and other conditions 
many of these conditions are beyond our control 
these conditions include employment levels  changing demographics  availability of financing  consumer confidence and housing demand 
in addition  homebuilders are subject to risks related to competitive overbuilding  availability and cost of building lots  availability of materials and labor  adverse weather conditions which can cause delays in construction schedules  cost overruns  changes in governmental regulations and increases in real estate taxes and other local government fees 
during  we experienced certain delays caused by weather conditions and delays in regulatory processes in certain markets that had an impact on the number of new contracts and homes delivered during availability and affordability of residential mortgage financing could adversely affect our business 
our business is significantly affected by the impact of interest rates 
higher interest rates may decrease our potential market by making it more difficult for homebuyers to qualify for mortgages or to obtain mortgages at interest rates that are acceptable to them 
mortgage rates are currently close to historically low levels 
if mortgage interest rates increase  our business could be adversely affected 
material and labor shortages could adversely affect our business 
the residential construction industry has  from time to time  experienced significant material and labor shortages in insulation  drywall  brick  cement and certain areas of carpentry and framing  as well as fluctuations in lumber prices and supplies 
any shortages of long duration in these areas could delay construction of homes  which could adversely affect our business 
at this time  we are not experiencing any significant material or labor shortages and  therefore  do not anticipate a material effect for the year we commit significant resources to land development activities which involve significant risks 
we develop the lots for a majority of our subdivisions 
therefore  our short term and long term financial success will be dependent upon our ability to develop these subdivisions successfully 
acquiring land and committing the financial and managerial resources to develop a subdivision involves significant risks 
before a subdivision generates any revenue  we may make material expenditures for items such as acquiring land and constructing subdivision infrastructure roads and utilities 
competition in our industry could adversely affect our business 
the homebuilding industry is highly competitive 
we compete in each of our local markets with numerous national  regional and local homebuilders  some of which have greater financial  marketing  land acquisition  and sales resources than we do 
builders of new homes compete not only for homebuyers  but also for desirable properties  financing  raw materials and skilled subcontractors 
we also compete with the existing home resale market that provides certain attractions for homebuyers over the new home market 
in addition  the mortgage financing industry is very competitive 
m i financial competes with outside lenders for the capture of our homebuyers 
competition typically increases during periods in which there is a decline in the refinance activity within the industry 
during  m i financial experienced a slight decline in its capture rate  and we expect to see a continued decline in that could negatively impact the results of m i financial 
governmental regulation and environmental considerations could adversely affect our business 
the homebuilding industry is subject to increasing local  state and federal statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations concerning zoning  resource protection  building design and construction  and similar matters 
this includes local regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular location 
such regulation also affects construction activities  including construction materials that must be used in certain aspects of building design  as well as sales activities and other dealings with homebuyers 
we must also obtain licenses  permits and approvals from various governmental agencies for our development activities  the granting of which are beyond our control 
furthermore  increasingly stringent requirements may be imposed on homebuilders and developers in the future 
although we cannot predict the impact on us to comply with any such requirements  such requirements could result in time consuming and expensive compliance programs 
in addition  we have been  and in the future may be  subject to periodic delays or may be precluded from developing certain projects due to building moratoriums 
these moratoriums generally relate to insufficient water supplies or sewage facilities  delays in utility hookups or inadequate road capacity within the specific market area or subdivision 
these moratoriums can occur prior to  or subsequent to  commencement of our operations without notice or recourse 
we are also subject to a variety of local  state and federal statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment 
the particular environmental laws that apply to any given project vary greatly according to the project site and the present and former uses of the property 
these environmental laws may result in delays  cause us to incur substantial compliance costs including substantial expenditures for pollution and water quality control and prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions 
although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in all cases  we have a general practice of requiring resolution of environmental issues prior to purchasing land in an effort to avoid major environmental issues in our developments 
in addition to the laws and regulations that relate to our homebuilding operations  m i financial is subject to a variety of laws and regulations concerning the underwriting  servicing and sale of mortgage loans 
we are dependent on a limited number of markets 
we have operations in columbus and cincinnati  ohio  indianapolis  indiana  tampa  orlando and west palm beach  florida  charlotte and raleigh  north carolina  and the virginia and maryland suburbs of washington  dc adverse general economic conditions in these markets could have a material impact on our operations 
for  approximately of our operating income was derived from operations in the columbus market 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates 
we are exposed to interest rate risk through the borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities that permit borrowings up to million 
to minimize the effects of interest rate fluctuations  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with certain banks to fix a portion of the interest relating to our revolving credit facilities 
our interest rate swaps were not designated as hedges under sfas when it was adopted 
we were exposed to market risk associated with changes in the fair values of the swaps  and such changes are reflected in our income statements 
at december   the fair value adjustment resulted in the company recording a million liability  this liability was reduced to zero upon expiration of these agreements during the third quarter of additionally  m i financial is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its mortgage loan origination services 
interest rate lock commitments irlcs are extended to home buying customers who have applied for mortgages and who meet certain defined credit and underwriting criteria 
typically  the irlcs will have a duration of less than six months  however  in certain markets  the duration could extend to twelve months 
some irlcs are committed to a specific third party investor through use of best effort whole loan delivery commitments matching the exact terms of the irlc loan 
the notional amount of the committed irlcs and the best efforts contracts at december  was million 
the fair value of both the committed irlcs and the related best efforts contracts was million 
uncommitted irlcs are considered derivative instruments under sfas and are fair value adjusted  with the resulting gain or loss recorded in current earnings 
at december   the notional amount of the uncommitted irlc loans was million 
the fair value adjustment  which is based on quoted market prices  related to these commitments resulted in a million asset at december  we have recorded million income  million expense and million in income relating to marking these commitments to market for the years ended december   and  respectively 
forward sales of mortgage backed securities fmbss are used to protect uncommitted irlc loans against the risk of changes in interest rates between the lock date and the funding date 
fmbss related to uncommitted irlcs are classified and accounted for as non designated derivative instruments  with gains and losses recorded in current earnings 
at december   the notional amount under the fmbss was million  and the related fair value adjustment  which is based on quoted market prices  resulted in less than a million liability 
we have recorded million income  million income and million expense relating to marking these fmbss to market for the years ended december   and  respectively 
additionally  immediately prior to or concurrent with funding uncommitted irlc loans  we enter into a commitment with a third party investor to buy the specific irlc loan
