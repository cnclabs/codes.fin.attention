pursuant to the merger agreement  as amended  we would issue shares of our common stock in exchange for each outstanding share of common stock of chronimed the exchange ratio 
in addition  each outstanding option to purchase chronimed common stock will be assumed by us and the exercise price and number of shares for which each such option is or will become exercisable will be adjusted based on the exchange ratio 
the merger is intended to constitute a tax free reorganization under section a of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
the consummation of the merger is subject to the approval and adoption of the merger and merger agreement by the 
table of contents shareholders of chronimed  the approval by our stockholders of the issuance of the shares of common stock to be issued in the merger and other customary closing conditions 
on february   we acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of natural living  inc  d b a fair pharmacy fair pharmacy  a specialty pharmaceutical provider located in bronx  new york  for million in cash  plus a performance based earn out of million paid after the first anniversary of the closing 
this contingent payment was recorded in december the acquisition enhanced our hiv  oncology and hepatitis c disease categories and has been incorporated into our specialty management and delivery services segment 
direct expenses associated with the acquisition were approximately million 
the acquisition has been accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
the cost of the acquisition was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimates of their respective fair values at the date of acquisition 
fair values of intangible assets were estimated by independent third party appraisal 
the assets purchased and liabilities assumed have been reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as of february  on march   we announced that the centers for medicare and medicaid services selected us as an approved national sponsor of two medicare discount drug card programs 
our medicare approved drug discount card programs are called freedom and choice 
we began enrollment for these discount cards on june  and currently have approximately  members enrolled 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
in preparing our financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates  and different assumptions or conditions may yield different estimates 
the following discussion highlights what we believe to be the critical accounting policies and judgments made in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we generate revenue principally through the sale of prescription drugs  which are dispensed either through a pharmacy participating in our pharmacy network or a pharmacy owned by us 
revenue is derived under two types of agreements i fee for service agreements and ii capitated agreements 
we do not anticipate entering into any material capitated pbm services arrangements in the future 
the rebate share paid to certain of our plan sponsors is recorded as a reduction of revenue 
fee for service agreements 
fee for service agreements include i specialty and mail service agreements  where we dispense prescription medications through our pharmacy facilities and ii pbm agreements  where prescription medications are dispensed through pharmacies participating in our retail pharmacy network as well as through our traditional mail service facility 
under fee for service agreements  revenue is recognized either a when the pharmacy services are reported to us through the point of sale pos claims processing system and the drug is dispensed to the member  in the case of a prescription filled through a pharmacy participating in our retail pharmacy network  or b at the time the drug is dispensed  in the case of a prescription filled through a pharmacy owned by us 
fee for service agreements accounted for  or million   or million  and  or million  of our revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenue generated under pbm agreements is classified as either gross or net by us based on whether we are acting as a principal or an agent in the fulfillment of prescriptions through our retail pharmacy network 
when we independently have a contractual obligation to pay a network pharmacy provider for benefits provided to its plan sponsors members  and have other indicia of risk and reward  we include payments which include the drug ingredient cost from these plan sponsors as revenue and payments to the network pharmacy providers as cost of revenue  as these transactions require us to assume credit risk and act as a principal 
if we merely act as an agent  and consequently administer plan sponsors network pharmacy contracts  we do not assume credit risk and record only the administrative fees and not the drug ingredient cost as revenue 
capitated agreements 
our capitated pbm services agreements with plan sponsors require us to provide covered pharmacy services to plan sponsors members in return for a fixed fee per member per month paid by the plan sponsor 
capitated contracts have terms varying from six months to three years 
at such time as management estimates that a contract will sustain losses over its remaining contractual life as a result of increased utilization or changes in product mix  a reserve is established for these estimated losses at that time 
there are currently no expected loss contracts  however  if historical patterns change  we may be required to estimate a loss contract accrual 
our largest capitated contract expired march  and the customer has been serviced on a fee for service basis since that time 
we are not actively pursuing new capitated contracts and expect that the amount of revenue derived from such contracts will continue to decline 
we have no capitated specialty management and delivery services agreements 
capitated agreements accounted for  or million   or million  and  or million  of our revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
co payments 
when prescriptions are filled in a pharmacy owned by us  we collect and retain co payments from plan sponsors members and record these receipts as revenue when the amounts are collected or deemed collectible and reasonably estimable 
when prescriptions are filled through pharmacies participating in our retail pharmacy networks  we are not entitled to 
table of contents retain co payments and accordingly does not account for retail pharmacy co payments in its financial statements 
pharmacy network co payments are never billed or collected by us and we have no legal right or obligation to receive them as they are collected by our network pharmacies 
allowance for doubtful accounts allowances for doubtful accounts are based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances 
the procedure for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts requires significant judgment and assumptions 
the risk of collection varies based upon the product  the payor and the patient s ability to pay the amounts not reimbursed by the payor 
we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon a variety of factors including the age of the outstanding receivables and our historical experience of collections  adjusting for current economic conditions and  in some cases  evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss 
we continually review the estimation process and make changes to the estimates as necessary 
allowance for contractual discounts we are reimbursed for the drugs and services we sell by plan sponsors and other payors including insurance companies  medicare and state medicaid programs 
revenues and related accounts receivable are recorded net of payor contractual discounts to reflect the estimated net billable amounts for the products and services delivered 
we estimate the allowance for contractual discounts  based on historical experience and in certain cases on a customer specific basis  given our interpretation of the contract terms or applicable regulations 
however  the reimbursement rates are often subject to interpretation that could result in payments that differ from our estimates 
additionally  updated regulations and contract negotiations occur frequently  necessitating our continual review and assessment of the estimation process 
rebates manufacturers rebates are recorded as estimates until such time as the rebate monies are received 
these estimates are based on historical results and trends and are revised on a regular basis depending on our latest forecasts  as well as information received from rebate sources 
should actual results differ  adjustments will be recorded in future earnings 
in some instances  rebate payments are shared with our managed care organizations 
shared rebates are recorded as a reduction of revenue 
total rebates are recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold 
purchase price allocation we account for acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  any assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values 
the recorded values of assets and liabilities are based on third party estimates and independent valuations 
the remaining values are based on management s judgments and estimates 
accordingly  our financial position or results of operations may be affected by changes in estimates and judgments used to value these assets and liabilities 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we account for income taxes under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires the use of the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred taxes are determined by calculating the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial accounting and tax bases of existing assets and liabilities 
the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the benefit from the deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets that will be utilized within twelve months are classified as current assets 
in and management reduced the valuation allowance for the federal net operating loss carryforwards nols as it was determined that the tax asset will more likely than not be realized 
all of the reversal of the valuation allowance in and a portion of such reduction in did not affect net income or the effective tax rate  as it related to nols resulting from stock option exercises  and accordingly  was recorded in stockholders equity 
in addition  we have established  and periodically review and reevaluate  an estimated income tax reserve which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
this income tax reserve is for exposures related to matters such as nexus  and allocation of overhead costs across various federal and state tax jurisdictions 
an accrual is established at the time an exposure is identified when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
while we believe that we have identified all reasonably identifiable exposures and that the reserve we have established for identifiable exposures is appropriate under the circumstance  it is possible that additional exposures exist and that the exposures will be settled at amounts different than the amounts reserved 
it is possible that changes in estimates in the future could cause us to either materially increase or reduce the carrying amount of our income tax reserve 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long lived assets  including intangible assets  may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of an asset may not be recoverable 
the measurement of possible impairment is based on the ability to recover the balance of assets from expected future operating cash flows on an undiscounted basis 
impairment losses  if any  would be determined based on the present value of the cash flows using discount rates that reflect the inherent risk of the underlying business 
it is management s belief that no such impairment existed as of december  effective on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement addresses the accounting and reporting of goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
since adoption of sfas no 
in july  amortization of goodwill was discontinued  and goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment 

table of contents we evaluate goodwill for impairment based on a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is necessary to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we have two reporting units and the fair values of both of the reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts resulting in no impairment charges in fiscal year indefinite lived intangible under the provisions of sfas no 
we are required to perform an annual impairment analysis for our indefinite lived intangible ie  tradename which has a book value of million at december  the analysis compares the fair value of an intangible asset to the carrying value of that asset at least annually 
if the estimated fair value of an intangible asset is determined to be lower than its carrying value  an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
the determination of fair value of this intangible asset requires management to use estimates and assumptions of the future cash flows and discount rates 
changes to these assumptions could affect the estimated fair value 
we have tested fair value of this intangible asset during  and determined it exceeded the carrying value 
we cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of the intangible asset that is carried at million at december  such events include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on our customer base  or a material negative change in our relationships with significant customers 
accounting for stock based compensation we account for employee stock and stock based compensation plans through the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
and as such  generally recognizes no compensation expense for employee stock options 
on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach to estimating the fair value of options in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r must be adopted no later than july  we will adopt the fair value based method of accounting for share based payments effective july  the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we are still evaluating the alternative methods available in calculating and adopting this standard  and has not yet reached a decision on which method to use 
at this time it is not possible to estimate the impact the adoption of sfas no 
r will have on our future financial results

in the fourth quarter of we changed the life of the intangible assets acquired with the vitality acquisition 
the adjusted expected amortizable life of these assets range from three to ten years 
interest expense  net net interest expense has remained constant at million for the years  and interest expense is primarily comprised of interest on the line of credit borrowings  interest paid for capital leases  offset by minimal interest income on excess cash invested overnight 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was million for and million for the effective tax rate was in compared to in the tax rate was positively impacted by state tax planning effectuated in at december   we had remaining federal net operating losses nols of million which begin expiring in and state net operating losses of million with varying expiration dates 
the state operating losses have a full valuation allowance recorded against them as there is uncertainty concerning our ability to utilize the state nols prior to expiration 
the provision for income taxes was million for and million for the effective tax rate for was compared to a rate for in allowances on certain federal nols were reversed  a portion of which affected the effective tax rate and the remainder of which related to stock option exercises and were adjusted through stockholders equity 
at december   we had remaining federal nols of million  and state nols of million 
in  management evaluated the remaining valuation allowance for the federal nols and concluded that the allowance was no longer needed as the tax asset will more likely than not be realized 
therefore  the total valuation allowance related to our federal nols  all of which were generated from stock option exercises  was reversed 
the reversal did not affect income or our effective tax rate 
net income and earnings per share net income for was million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share for the decrease is principally the result of the factors enumerated above  including the tenncare and synagis losses  value options settlement and noncapitalizable acquisition costs

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we utilize both funds generated from operations and available credit under our facility as defined below for acquisitions  capital expenditures and general working capital needs 
for  net cash provided from operating activities totaled million compared to million for the decrease in operating cash flows from to was the result of the delay in rebate payments shared with terminated tenncare clients of million in as well as opportunistic inventory purchases in the fourth quarter and the timing of payments to vendors and network pharmacies 
accounts receivable balances increased from to as a result of the increase in revenue 
days sales outstanding decreased year over year 
net cash used in investing activities in was million compared to million used in the increase resulted primarily from acquiring fair pharmacy in february net cash provided by financing activities in was million compared to net cash used in financing activities in of million 
at december  there were million of outstanding bank borrowings under our million revolving credit facility the facility with an affiliate of healthcare finance group  inc hfg  a million increase from the same period in outstanding borrowings increased in as a result of borrowing for the acquisition of fair pharmacy 
net cash used in financing activities in was for the purchase of treasury stock and payment on the facility 
at december   we had working capital of million compared to million at december   primarily attributable to the use of cash and borrowing amounts available under our line of credit to purchase fair pharmacy 
the facility has a three year term secured by our receivables with interest paid monthly 
it provides for borrowings of up to million at the london inter bank offered rate libor plus 
the facility contains various covenants that  among other things  require us to maintain certain financial ratios  as defined in the agreements governing the facility 
after the initial three year term  the facility automatically renews for additional one year terms unless either party gives notice not less than days prior to the expiration of the initial term or any renewal term of its intention not to renew the facility 
the facility permits us to request an increase in the amount available for borrowing up to million  as well as converting a portion of any outstanding borrowings from a revolving loan into a term loan 
the borrowing base is based on receivables balances  among other things 
our daily borrowings during were million  of which million was repaid during at the end of any given month during the line of credit balance did not exceed million 
the borrowing and repayment processes under the facility are outlined below 
under the terms of the facility  all remittances from customers are sent deposited into our lock box accounts with authorized access by hfg 
regardless of whether any portion of the facility is outstanding on any given day  all available cash in the lock box accounts is swept daily by hfg to its account 
if there are no amounts owed under the facility  the swept cash is transferred back the same day to our main bank account 
if any amounts are currently outstanding under the facility  the swept cash is immediately applied by hfg against all or a portion of the loan balance 
any cash available after repayment of the entire outstanding loan balance on any given day is transferred back to us as discussed above 
all of our checks are drawn on one of two disbursement accounts  one for pharmacy claims payments and one for all other accounts payable 
checks are presented for payment daily to the disbursement accounts and are automatically funded by a transfer from our main concentration account 
if there are sufficient available balances in the concentration account  funds are automatically transferred to the disbursement accounts to cover the presentments 
if there are not sufficient available balances in the concentration account we must borrow from the facility that day 
one of our authorized officers transmits a notice to hfg with the requested amount by noon 
within an hour hfg wires the requested amount as available funds to the concentration account  which amount is then automatically transferred the same day to the disbursement accounts to cover the presentments 
on february   we acquired fair pharmacy for million in cash 
direct expenses associated with the acquisition were approximately million 
the acquisition was paid for with proceeds from the facility  as well as available cash on hand 
as we continue to grow  we anticipate that our working capital needs will also continue to increase 
we believe that our cash on hand  together with funds available under the facility and cash expected to be generated from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our anticipated working capital and other cash needs for a least the next twelve months 
we also may pursue joint venture arrangements  business acquisitions and other transactions designed to expand our specialty management and delivery services and pbm services businesses  which we would expect to fund from cash on hand  borrowings under the facility  other future indebtedness or  if appropriate  the private and or public sale or exchange of our debt or equity securities 
at december   we had federal nols of approximately million  which will begin expiring in our remaining federal nols will not affect our effective tax rate when utilized  but we will receive the cash flow benefit from the reduction in our 
table of contents income tax liability 
certain of the nols are subject to limitation and may be utilized in a future year upon release of the limitation 
if the nols are not utilized in the year they are available they may be utilized in a future year to the extent they have not expired 
due to the pending transaction with chronimed  our nols may be subject to an annual limitation regarding their future utilization against taxable income due to a change of ownership in accordance with the provisions under section of the internal revenue code 
these annual limitations may effect the utilization of both federal and state nols and also the tax deductions for assets that have book basis in excess of tax basis 
we expect our annual effective tax rate to be approximately 
this rate differs from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to state taxes 
on february  we announced a stock repurchase program pursuant to which we are authorized to purchase up to million of our common stock from time to time by various means 
as of december   we used  in the aggregate  approximately million of that authorization

net of reserves  a charge of million was recorded in sg a expenses in the fourth quarter of regulatory matters on april   the us department of health and human services  office of inspector general oig released compliance program guidance for pharmaceutical manufacturers the guidance designed to provide voluntary  nonbinding guidance to assist companies that develop  manufacture  market and sell pharmaceutical products or biological products  including pbm s in devising effective compliance programs 
the guidance provides the oig s view of the fundamental elements of pharmaceutical manufacturer s compliance programs and principles that should be considered when creating and implementing an effective compliance program  or as a benchmark for companies with existing compliance programs 
we currently maintain a compliance program that includes the key compliance program elements described in the guidance
