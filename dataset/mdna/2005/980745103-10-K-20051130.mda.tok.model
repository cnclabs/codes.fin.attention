item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we prepared the following discussion and analysis to help you better understand our financial condition  changes in our financial condition  and results of operations 
this discussion should be read with the consolidated financial statements 
overview our business is focused on the design  manufacture  and servicing of energy control systems and components for aircraft and industrial engines and turbines 
to penetrate our target markets power generation  process industries  transportation  and aerospace our strategy focuses on maintaining and developing technologies that are used in the development of components and integrated systems for power equipment used by customers worldwide 
we have two operating segments industrial controls and aircraft engine systems 
industrial controls is focused on the technologies  components  integrated systems  power equipment  and customers for industrial markets  which includes power generation  process industries  and transportation 
aircraft engine systems is focused on the technologies  components  integrated systems  power equipment  and customers for the aerospace market 
we use segment information internally to assess the performance of each segment and to make decisions on the allocation of resources 
our sales and earnings have increased in each of the last years 
our markets have substantially recovered from the declines that occurred in and and both of our segments benefited from these recoveries 
lower effective income tax rates also resulted in improved earnings  largely as a result of factors that we do not expect to continue in the future 
despite a higher tax rate and the requirement to begin recognizing stock compensation expense  we believe sales and earnings will show further improvement in 
table of contents our research and development costs increased in we are committed to investing in our broad portfolio of technologies to remain a leader in energy control systems and components for aircraft and industrial engines and turbines 
increased development activity is primarily linked to several customer program wins in aerospace markets  as well as combustion sensing technologies and product development for the turbine auxiliary market 
we are also continuing to execute the consolidation of european operations to streamline our organization and gain production cost efficiencies 
while the majority of the cost for the consolidation was recognized in and  substantially all the benefits will begin to be realized in when the actions are completed at the end of our second quarter in  we estimate that the annual savings will approximate million to million as compared to amounts that would have been incurred prior to the actions 
at september   our total assets exceeded million  including million in cash  and our total debt was less than million 
we are well positioned to fund expanded research and development and to explore other investment opportunities consistent with our focused strategies 
in the sections that follow  we are providing information to help you better understand factors that may affect our future results  our critical accounting policies and market risks  our results of operations and financial condition  and the effects of recent accounting pronouncements 
factors that may affect future results this annual report contains forward looking statements  including projections of sales  earnings  cash flows  or other financial items  descriptions of our plans and objectives for future operations  forecasts of future economic performance  and descriptions of assumptions underlying the above items 
forward looking statements do not reflect historical facts 
rather  they are statements about future events and conditions and often include words such as anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  intend  plan  project  target  can  could  may  should  will  would or similar expressions 
such statements reflect our expectations about the future only as of the date they are made 
we are not obligated to  and we might not  update our forward looking statements to reflect changes that occur after the date they are made 
furthermore  actual results could differ materially from projections or any other forward looking statement regardless of when they are made 
important factors that could individually  or together with one or more other factors  affect our business  results of operations and or financial condition include  but are not limited to  the following general business and economic conditions  including the strength of the global economy particularly the economies of the united states  europe  and asia  fluctuations in exchange rates of foreign currencies against the united states dollar primarily currencies of european and asian countries  and fluctuations in interest rates primarily libor  which affect our cost of borrowings  industry specific business and economic conditions  including the strength of manufacturers of industrial diesel and gas engines  industrial gas turbines  steam turbines  compressors  gensets and switchgear  and fuel cells for power generation  transportation  and process industries markets  manufacturers of aircraft gas turbines for commercial and military aerospace markets  and commercial airlines  significant geopolitical events and actions that impact business and economic conditions  including acts or threats of terrorism  actions taken by the united states or other governments in response to acts or threats of terrorism  and trade embargoes  changes in the legal environment of the united states and other countries in which we operate  including changes in the areas of taxation  business acquisitions  and environmental matters  changes in competitive conditions  including the availability of new products and services  the introduction of new channels of distribution  and changes in oem and aftermarket pricing  
table of contents reliability of customer and third party forecasts of sales volumes and purchase requirements in our markets  including power generation  transportation  process industries  and aerospace markets  our ability to continue to develop innovative new products and product enhancements that are accepted by our customers and markets in accordance with our project schedules and resource plans  our ability to complete our consolidation of manufacturing operations in the netherlands  united kingdom  and japan with existing operations in the united states  germany  and china that was begun in in accordance with anticipated timeframes  cost estimates  and annual savings  effects of business acquisitions and or divestitures  including the incremental effects of the business acquired or divested  the completion of integration activities within planned timeframes and at planned cost levels  and the achievement of planned operating efficiencies  effects of quality and productivity initiatives  including achievement of expected results from ongoing improvement programs and maintenance of supplier designation levels with key customers  effects of changes in accounting policies resulting from new accounting pronouncements and or changes in the selection and application of accounting methods necessary to implement accounting policies  effects of unusual or extraordinary events  or of other events and unforeseen developments involving litigation or other contingencies 
critical accounting policies we consider the accounting policies used in preparing our financial statements to be critical accounting policies when they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and require us to make difficult  subjective  or complex judgments 
critical accounting policies normally result from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the company s board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures that follow 
in each of the following areas  our judgments  estimates  and assumptions are impacted by conditions that change over time 
as a result  in the future there could be changes in our assets and liabilities  increases or decreases in our expenses  and additional losses or gains that are material to our financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill goodwill  which is included in the segment assets of both industrial controls and aircraft engine systems  totaled million at september   representing of total assets 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and more often if circumstances require 
impairment tests performed during the three years ended september   have not resulted in any impairment losses 
estimates and assumptions  the most important of which are used to estimate the fair value of reporting units within the company  impact the results of our goodwill impairment tests 
to estimate the fair value of reporting units  we estimate future cash flows  discount rates  and transaction multiples that we believe a marketplace participant would use in an arm s length transaction 
to assess the effect on our annual impairment tests in if different assumptions had been used  we separately measured the effects of a hypothetical reduction in estimated cash flows  a increase in the discount rates used  and a reduction in the transaction multiples used 
while each of these changes would have reduced the estimated fair value of reporting units within the company  none of them individually would have resulted in an impairment loss in other long lived assets as discussed here  our other long lived assets consist of property  plant  and equipment  and other intangibles  which are included primarily in the segment assets of both industrial controls and aircraft engine systems 
long lived assets totaled million at september   and represented of total assets 
we depreciate or amortize long lived assets over their estimated useful lives 
depreciation expense and 
table of contents amortization expense associated with these assets totaled million in  million in  and million in we also test long lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
the selection of useful lives for depreciation and amortization purposes requires judgment 
if we had increased the remaining useful life of all assets being depreciated and amortized by one year  depreciation and amortization expense would have decreased  and the year end carrying value of long lived assets would have increased  by approximately million in similarly  if we had decreased the remaining useful lives by one year  depreciation and amortization expense would have increased  and the year end carrying value of long lived assets would have decreased  by approximately million in the results of this sensitivity analysis ignore the impact of individual assets that might have become fully depreciated or amortized during had these hypothetical changes been made 
the carrying value of a long lived asset  or related group of assets  is reduced to its fair value whenever estimates of future cash flows are insufficient to indicate the carrying value is recoverable 
we form judgments as to whether recoverability should be assessed  we estimate future cash flows and  if necessary  we estimate fair value 
fair value estimates are most often based on estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates 
deferred income tax asset valuation allowances valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets totaled million at september   representing of deferred income tax assets before the allowances 
the net changes in the valuation allowances decreased income tax expense by million in and increased income tax expense by million in we establish valuation allowances to reflect the estimated amount of deferred tax assets that might not be realized 
both positive and negative evidence are considered in forming our judgment as to whether a valuation allowance is appropriate 
our current valuation allowances are primarily for deferred tax assets associated with foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
remaining deferred tax assets are expected to be realized through future earnings 
if we had made different judgments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets associated with foreign net operating loss carryforwards  our valuation allowance and income tax expense would have decreased 
if we had made different judgments regarding the realizability of other deferred tax assets  our valuation allowance and income tax expense would have increased 
retirement pension and healthcare benefits the cost of retirement pension and healthcare benefits is recognized over employee service periods using an actuarial based attribution approach 
our net accrued benefit for these retirement benefits totaled million at september   which represented of total liabilities and consisted of the following in millions pension healthcare benefit obligation fair value of plan assets unrecognized net losses unamortized prior service cost other items affecting the liability 
table of contents the net periodic benefit cost associated with these liabilities totaled million in  which consisted of the following in millions pension healthcare service cost interest cost expected return on plan assets recognized losses recognized prior service cost curtailment gain to determine our net accrued benefit and net periodic benefit cost  we form judgments about the best estimate for each assumption used in the actuarial computation 
the most important assumptions that affect the computations are the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and the healthcare cost trend rate 
our discount rate assumption is intended to reflect the rate at which the retirement benefits could be effectively settled based upon the assumed timing of the benefit payments 
in the united states  we use the blended moody s baa aaa index  the citigroup pension liability index  and the year us treasury rate as benchmarks 
in the united kingdom  we use the aa corporate bond index applicable for bonds over years and government bond yields for bonds over years to determine a blended rate to use as the benchmark 
in japan  we use aa rated corporate bond yields for bonds of years as the benchmark 
our assumed rates do not differ significantly from any of these benchmarks 
we assumed weighted average discount rates of to determine our retirement pension benefit obligation at september   and to determine the related service and interest costs in a increase in these discount rates would have decreased the benefit obligation at the end of by million and increased the total of service and interest costs by million in likewise  a decrease in these discount rates would have increased the benefit obligation by million and decreased the total of service and interest costs by million in we assumed weighted average discount rates of to determine our retirement healthcare benefit obligation at september   and to determine the related service and interest costs in a increase in these discount rates would have decreased the benefit obligation at the end of by million and increased the total of service and interest costs by million in likewise  a decrease in these discount rates would have increased the benefit obligation by million and decreased the total of service and interest costs by million in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets was based on our current asset allocations and the historical long term performance for each asset class  as adjusted for existing market conditions 
information regarding our asset allocations is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements in
