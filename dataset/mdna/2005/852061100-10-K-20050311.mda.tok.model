statements contained in this annual report relating to our business strategies  operating plans  planned expenditures  expected capital requirements  future dividend payments and other forward looking statements regarding our business do not take into account potential future impacts of our proposed merger with nextel or the contemplated spin off of our local telecommunications business 
business environment sprint s operations are divided into three lines of business wireless  local and long distance operations 
in the fourth quarter  sprint undertook an initiative to realign internal resources organizational realignment 
this effort was implemented to enhance our focus on the needs and preferences of two distinct consumer types businesses and individuals 
this effort is enabling sprint to more effectively and efficiently use its portfolio of assets to create customer focused communications solutions 
sprint continues to measure its results using the current business segmentation  taking into consideration the re aligned customer focused approach in the organizational realignment resulted in and could continue to result in decisions requiring restructuring charges and asset impairments 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information relating to these activities 
sprint operates in an industry that has been and continues to be subject to consolidation and dynamic change 
therefore  sprint routinely reassesses its business strategies 
due to changes in telecommunications  including bankruptcies  over capacity and the highly competitive pricing environment in all telecommunications sectors  sprint has taken actions to appropriately allocate capital and other resources to enable sustaining cash contribution 
sprint routinely assesses the implications of these actions on its operations and these assessments may continue to impact the future valuation of its long lived assets 
as part of its overall business strategy  sprint regularly evaluates opportunities to expand and complement its business and may at any time be discussing or negotiating a transaction that  if consummated  could have a material effect on its business  financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
in february  sprint reached a definitive agreement with global signal inc global signal under which global signal will have exclusive rights to lease or operate more than  communication towers owned by sprint for a negotiated lease term which is the greater of the remaining terms of the underlying ground leases or up to years  assuming successful re negotiation of the underlying ground leases at the end of their current lease terms 
sprint has committed to sublease space on approximately  of the towers from global signal for a minimum of ten years 
sprint will maintain ownership of the towers  and will continue to reflect the towers on its consolidated balance sheet 
results of operations management overview in  sprint executed against its plan and created positive momentum moving into  a period of continuing dynamic change in the telecommunications industry 
highlights of the key successes and themes which shaped the year include at the beginning of the year  we re organized our marketing  sales and support teams to focus on the specific needs of two types of consumers businesses and individuals 
we recombined our tracking stocks in the second quarter 
this aligned our capital structure with our integrated asset portfolio and reflects our transition from a product focused organization to a structure driven by customer needs 
we increased revenues compared to  primarily through growth in wireless revenues and steady performance in local offset by a decline in long distance 
by year end  approximately percent of our revenue came from wireless  internet and other data services  such as dsl 
this underscores the importance of our balanced mix of assets 
even as long distance and local continued to feel the pressure from technology substitution  usage trends and competition  our results in growth sectors like wireless data and dsl helped offset the impacts to our bottom line 
we improved the customer experience 
in wireless  we instituted sprint pcs fair flexible sm pricing and the better wireless guarantee 
subscribers are enjoying more of our advanced features and options  as was shown in the growth of data 
in local  we have been very successful with our bundled offerings  and by year end  percent of households subscribed to at least one strategic product 
we exceeded our debt reduction targets for we reduced debt by billion and ended the year with more than billion of additional cash and cash equivalents 
in december  we announced our proposed merger of equals with nextel and contemplated spin off of the local telecommunications business 
during the year  we faced challenges as well 
in those situations  we made difficult decisions and took action to sustain momentum 
we spent significant resources restoring service and normalcy to those areas impacted by the hurricanes in the southeast region of the united states 
industry wide business conditions in the long distance industry  including highly competitive market pricing and a negative regulatory climate  triggered a re evaluation of our strategy and financial forecasts  and determined that a write down of the long distance network of billion was required 
we recorded that impairment in value in the third quarter 
the phrase we believe describes sprint in is focused execution 
consolidated millions net operating revenues income loss from continuing operations net operating revenues increased in reflecting growth in wireless revenues partially offset by declining long distance and local revenues 
sprint s income loss from continuing operations in  and includes the after tax impacts of the items discussed below 
in  sprint recorded net restructuring and asset impairment charges of billion related to the impairment of sprint s long distance property  plant and equipment and severance costs associated with sprint s organizational realignment and web hosting wind down activities 
also included in was a million charge related to the early retirement of senior notes and equity unit notes 
these charges consist of premiums paid and the recognition of deferred debt costs 
these charges were partially offset by a benefit of million resulting from the receipt of the final payments of a bankruptcy settlement with mci 
in  sprint recorded net restructuring charges and asset impairments of billion 
these charges were associated with the write down due to the decline in fair value of multipoint multichannel distribution services spectrum  now called broadband radio services brs  other asset impairment charges  facilities and severance charges associated with the termination of the web hosting business  impairment charges associated with the termination of development of a new billing platform  impairment charges associated with the termination of software development projects  and severance costs associated with sprint s transformation to a customer focused organizational design  offset by the finalization of all and restructuring liabilities 
also included in was a million charge in connection with separation agreements with three former executive officers  a million charge mainly reflecting the premiums paid on a debt tender offer and the early retirement of local debt  and a million charge to settle a securities class action and derivative lawsuit relating to the failed merger with worldcom now mci 
these charges were partially offset by a million tax benefit for recognition of certain income tax credits relating to various taxing jurisdictions and adjustments for state tax apportionments and a million settlement of accounts receivable claims with mci that had previously been fully reserved 
in  sprint recorded restructuring charges and asset impairments of million representing consolidations in sprint s network  information technology  and billing and accounts receivable organizations  impairment of a network asset  abandoned network project costs and additional steps to reduce overall operating costs 
also included in were the expected loss on receivables due to the bankruptcy declaration of worldcom now mci of million  a net restructuring and asset impairment charge of million  a gain on the sale of wireless investment in pegaso telecomunicaciones  sa de sa pegaso of million  a gain from the sale of customer contracts of million  the write down of an investment due to declining market value of million  and a tax benefit related to capital losses not previously recognizable of million 
critical accounting policies the fundamental objective of financial reporting is to provide useful information that allows a reader to comprehend the business activities of sprint 
to aid in that understanding  management has identified sprint s critical accounting policies 
these policies are considered critical because they have the potential to have a material impact on sprint s financial statements  and because they require judgements and estimation due to the uncertainty involved in measuring  at a specific point in time  events which are continuous in nature 
long lived asset recovery a significant portion of sprint s total assets are long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment pp e and definite life intangibles  as well as goodwill and indefinite life intangibles 
changes in technology or in sprint s intended use of these assets  as well as changes in broad economic or industry factors  may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change 
depreciable lives of assets sprint performs annual internal studies to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for each category of pp e 
these studies utilize models  which take into account actual usage  physical wear and tear  replacement history  and assumptions about technology evolution  and use in certain instances actuarially determined probabilities to calculate remaining life of our asset base 
sprint believes that the accounting estimate related to the establishment of asset depreciable lives is a critical accounting estimate because it requires sprint management to make assumptions about technology evolution and competitive uses of assets  and the impact of changes in these assumptions could be material to our financial position  as well as our results of operations 
management s assumptions about technology and its future development require significant judgement because the timing and impacts of technology advances are difficult to predict  and actual experience has varied from previous assumptions and could continue to do so 
if sprint s studies had resulted in a depreciable rate that was higher or lower than those used in the preparation of sprint s consolidated financial statements  recorded depreciation expense would have been impacted by approximately million 
property  plant and equipment and definite life intangibles impairment pp e and definite life intangibles are evaluated for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
accounting standards require that if an impairment indicator is present  sprint must assess whether the carrying amount of the asset is unrecoverable by estimating the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from the asset  undiscounted and without interest charges 
if the carrying amount is more than the recoverable amount  an impairment charge must be recognized  based on the fair value of the asset 
sprint believes that the accounting estimate related to asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate because it requires sprint management to make assumptions about future revenues and costs of sales over the life of the asset  judgement is involved in determining the occurrence of a triggering event  and the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on our financial position  as well as our results of operations  could be material 
management s assumptions about future revenues require significant judgement because actual revenues have fluctuated in the past and may continue to do so 
in estimating future revenues  we use our internal business forecasts 
we develop our forecasts based on recent revenue data for existing products and services  planned timing of new products and services  and other industry and economic factors 
when indicators are present  sprint tests for impairment 
this resulted in total pp e impairments of billion  million  and million in   and  respectively 
in  sprint recorded billion related to an impairment of the long distance network assets and million related to the write down of the wholesale dial ip assets prior to the sale of that business in october  these impairments represent of long distance s net pp e and of the consolidated net pp e at december  in  sprint recorded million associated with the termination of its web hosting business and million associated with the terminated development of a new billing platform and a software development project 
these impairments represent two percent of the december  consolidated net pp e 
in  sprint recorded million for network asset impairments and million for abandoned network projects 
these impairments represent less than one percent of the december  consolidated net pp e 
goodwill and indefinite life intangibles goodwill and indefinite life intangibles are reviewed at least annually for impairment  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
goodwill is tested by comparing net book value of the reporting unit identified as sprint s operating segments to fair value of the reporting unit 
indefinite life intangibles are tested by comparing book value to estimated fair value of the asset 
sprint believes that the accounting estimate related to goodwill and indefinite life intangibles is a critical accounting estimate because it requires sprint management to make assumptions about fair values  judgement is involved in determining the occurrence of a triggering event  and the impact of recognizing an impairment could be material to our financial position  as well as our results of operations 
management s assumptions about fair values require significant judgement because broad economic factors  industry factors and technology considerations can result in variable and volatile fair values 
management completed impairment analyses on both goodwill and indefinite life intangibles in the fourth quarter 
these tests were performed internally 
as of december   no impairments existed 
in the third quarter  sprint decided to end pursuit of a residential fixed wireless strategy using its brs spectrum 
this decision required an impairment analysis of the asset 
a decline in the fair value of brs drove long distance to record a pre tax  non cash charge of billion  which reduced the carrying value to million 
sprint continues to focus its efforts on a broad range of alternative strategies 
sprint is continuing to invest in the spectrum  is monitoring technology and industry developments  and is involved in efforts to achieve favorable regulatory rulings with respect to this spectrum 
employee benefit plan assumptions retirement benefits are a significant cost of doing business for sprint and yet represent obligations that will be settled far in the future 
retirement benefit accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of the future benefit costs over the employee s expected tenure with sprint based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made by sprint 
the accounting requires that management make assumptions regarding such variables as the return on assets  the discount rate and future health care costs 
changes in these key assumptions can have a significant impact on the projected benefit obligation and periodic benefit cost incurred by sprint 
sprint believes that the accounting estimate related to retirement benefit accounting is a critical accounting estimate because it requires sprint management to make assumptions about discount rates  future health care costs  and future return on assets funding the obligation  and the impact that changes in actual performance versus these estimates would have on the projected benefit obligation reported on our balance sheet and the benefit cost could be material 
in determining pension obligations  assumptions are required concerning market performance 
market performance has fluctuated in the recent past and could have continued volatility in the future 
in selecting its assumptions  sprint uses historical experience  as well as objective indices  as benchmarks  and tests the benchmarks against historical industry data on these assumptions provided by an independent actuary 
an increase in the discount rate would reduce the reported projected benefit obligation 
in contrast  if the discount rate in used in determining the projected benefit obligation was basis points lower  it would generate a million increase in the projected benefit obligation reported on the balance sheet  and a million increase in the benefit costs 
similarly  if the expected return on assets assumption was basis points lower  it would generate a million increase in current year benefit costs 
this assumption is not used in calculation of the pension projected benefit obligation 
in determining post retirement medical and life insurance benefit obligations  assumptions are made concerning the cost of health care 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed medical inflation rate would generate an million increase in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation reported on the balance sheet  and a million increase in benefit costs 
an increase in the discount rate would reduce the reported accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 
in contrast  if the discount rate in used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was basis points lower  it would generate a million increase in the reported year end obligation and an immaterial impact on benefit costs 
tax valuation allowances sprint is required to estimate the amount of tax payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in its financial statements or tax returns for each taxing jurisdiction in which it operates 
this process requires sprint s management to make assessments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact 
sprint records valuation allowances on deferred tax assets to reflect the expected realizable future tax benefits 
actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law  the proposed spin off of local  significant changes in the jurisdictions in which sprint operates  sprint s inability to generate sufficient future taxable income or unpredicted results from the final determination of each year s liability by taxing authorities 
these changes can have a significant impact on the financial position of sprint 
sprint believes that the accounting estimate related to establishing tax valuation allowances is a critical accounting estimate because it requires sprint management to make assessments about the timing of future events  including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities  and the impact changes in actual performance versus these estimates could have on the realization of tax benefit as reported in our results of operations could be material 
management s assumptions require significant judgement because actual performance has fluctuated in the past and may continue to do so 
sprint currently carries an income tax valuation allowance of million on its books 
this amount includes a valuation allowance for the total tax benefits related to net operating loss carryforwards  subject to utilization restrictions  acquired in connection with certain acquisitions 
the remainder of the valuation allowance relates primarily to state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
assumption changes which result in a reduction of expected benefits from realization of state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards by would increase our valuation allowance by million 
revenue recognition policies sprint recognizes operating revenues as services are rendered or as products are delivered to customers in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
in connection with recording revenue  estimates and assumptions are required in determining the expected conversion of the revenue streams to cash collected 
the revenue estimation process requires management to make assumptions based on historical results  future expectations  the economic and competitive environment  changes in the credit worthiness of our customers  and other relevant factors 
changes in these key assumptions can have a significant impact on the projection of cash collected and the periodic revenue stream recognized by sprint 
sprint believes that the accounting estimates related to the establishment of revenue and receivable reserves and the associated provisions in the results of operations is a critical accounting estimate because it requires sprint management to make assumptions about future billing adjustments for disputes with customers  unauthorized usage  future returns on asset sales and future access adjustments for disputes with competitive local exchange carriers and inter exchange carriers  as well as the future economic viability of our customer base  and the impact of changes in actual performance versus these estimates would have on the accounts receivable reported on our balance sheet and the results reported in our statements of operations could be material 
in selecting these assumptions  sprint uses historical trending of write offs  industry norms  regulatory decisions and recognition of current market indicators about general economic conditions which might impact the collectibility of accounts 
if the revenue reserve estimates were to be increased by basis points bps  it would represent a reduction of net operating revenues of approximately million for wireless  less than million for local and approximately million for long distance 
if the accounts receivable reserve estimates were to be increased by bps  it would represent an increase in bad debt expense of approximately million for wireless  million for local and million for long distance 
management believes the reserve estimate selected  in each instance  represents its best estimate of future outcomes  but the actual outcomes could differ from the estimate selected 
segmental results of operations wireless wireless operates a digital pcs wireless network with licenses to provide service to the entire united states population  including puerto rico and the us virgin islands  using a single frequency band and a single technology 
wireless  together with third party affiliates  operates pcs systems in over metropolitan markets  including the largest us metropolitan areas  and reaches a quarter billion people 
combined with our wholesale partners and sprint pcs affiliates  wireless served million subscribers at the end of wireless provides nationwide service through a combination of operating its own digital network in major us metropolitan areas using code division multiple access cdma  which is a digital spread spectrum wireless technology that allows a large number of users to access a single frequency band by assigning a code to all voice and data bits  sending a scrambled transmission of the encoded bits over the air and reassembling the voice and data into its original format  affiliating under commercial arrangements with other companies that use cdma  mainly in and around smaller us metropolitan areas  roaming on other providers analog cellular networks using multi mode and multi band handsets  and roaming on other providers digital networks that use cdma 
wireless subscribers can use their phones through roaming agreements in countries other than the united states  including areas of asia pacific  including china  guam  hong kong  taiwan  thailand and new zealand  canada and mexico  central and south america  including argentina  bolivia  chile  ecuador  guatemala  paraguay  peru  uruguay and venezuela  and most major caribbean islands 
sprint s third generation g capability allows more efficient utilization of the network when voice calls are made using g enabled handsets 
it also provides enhanced data services 
the service  marketed as sprint pcs vision sm  allows consumer and business customers to use their vision enabled pcs devices to exchange instant messages  exchange personal and corporate e mail  send and receive pictures  play games with full color graphics and polyphonic sounds and browse the internet wirelessly with speeds up to kbps with average speeds of to kbps 
sprint is continuing to execute its plans for faster wireless data speeds by deploying evolution data optimized ev do technology across the sprint nationwide pcs network 
with average users speed of kilobits per second and peak rates of up to megabits per second for downloads  ev do will provide mobile device data speeds up to times faster than on our current network 
in addition  this technology is expected to deliver superior application and service performance on ev do capable handsets and laptops equipped with ev do enabled sprint pcs connection cards 
sprint is targeting the first commercial roll out of ev do in the second quarter and subsequent roll outs throughout additional traffic volumes related to ev do may require future capital expenditures 
wireless supplements its own network through commercial affiliation arrangements with other companies that use cdma 
under these arrangements  these companies offer wireless services under sprint s brand on cdma networks built and operated at their own expense 
we call these companies sprint pcs affiliates 
generally  the sprint pcs affiliates use spectrum owned and controlled by sprint 
sprint has amended its existing agreements with a majority of the sprint pcs affiliates to provide for a simplified pricing mechanism  as well as refining and changing various business processes 
the amended agreements cover approximately of the subscribers served by all sprint pcs affiliates 
the agreements provide simplified and predictable long term pricing for fees charged to the sprint pcs affiliates for inter area service 
in addition  the agreements settled all significant outstanding disputes with these affiliates 
one sprint pcs affiliate  which has not agreed to amend its existing agreement with us  has filed suit against us 
this same affiliate and some other sprint pcs affiliates are disputing and refusing to pay amounts owed to sprint 
reserves have been established that are expected to provide for the ultimate resolution of these disputes 
wireless may incur additional expenses to ensure that service is available to its subscribers in the areas served by the sprint pcs affiliates 
if any of the sprint pcs affiliates cease operations  wireless may incur roaming charges in areas where service was previously provided by the sprint pcs affiliates and costs to meet fcc buildout and renewal requirements  as well as experience lower revenues 
sprint is subject to exclusivity provisions and other restrictions under its arrangements with the sprint pcs affiliates 
once the proposed merger is completed  continued compliance with those restrictions may limit the ability to fully integrate the operations of sprint and nextel in areas managed by the sprint pcs affiliates  and sprint or sprint nextel could incur significant costs to resolve issues related to the proposed merger under these arrangements 
we are currently working with sprint pcs affiliates to modify our arrangements with them such that the proposed merger of sprint and nextel will be mutually beneficial 
wireless also provides wireless services to companies that resell wireless services to their customers on a retail basis under their own brand using the sprint nationwide pcs network 
these companies bear the costs of acquisition  billing and customer service 
in  virgin mobile usa  llc  a joint venture between sprint and the virgin group  launched services targeting youth and pre pay segments 
sprint also has a multi year  exclusive wholesale agreement with qwest communications qwest whereby qwest wireless subscribers use sprint s national pcs network and have access to sprint pcs vision data services 
qwest began adding new subscribers under this agreement in the first quarter 
in the second quarter  existing qwest subscribers began transitioning to sprint s nationwide pcs network and this transition is expected to be substantively complete by the first quarter 
the wireless industry typically generates a higher number of subscriber additions and handset sales in the fourth quarter of each year compared to the other quarters 
this is due to the use of retail distribution  which is impacted by the holiday shopping season  the timing of new products and service introductions  and aggressive marketing and sales promotions 
millions net operating revenues service equipment wholesale  affiliate and other total net operating revenues operating expenses costs of services and products selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization restructuring and asset impairment total operating expenses operating income capital expenditures in  wireless reported a increase in net operating revenues  a million improvement in operating income  and a increase in direct subscribers 
in  sprint expects to continue to grow its wireless subscriber base by enhancing the subscriber experience through simplified offerings  improved accessibility  enhanced network clarity  and quality subscriber care 
competitive pressure on price is expected to continue  but is expected to be partially offset by increased revenues from services that subscribers can elect to add to their base plan  including sprint pcs vision services 
sprint is a leader in wireless data  with more than of the direct wireless base subscribing to data services 
we continue to evaluate next generation wireless high speed data network options to ensure we maintain a leadership position  as well as to support our integration strategies 
net operating revenues direct subscribers at year end millions average monthly service revenue per user arpu wireless had million direct net subscriber additions in including  subscribers acquired from a sprint pcs affiliate 
wireless ended the year with million direct subscribers 
wholesale partners added million subscribers in  increasing their subscriber base to million from million in  principally driven by virgin mobile usa and qwest 
the sprint pcs affiliates added  subscribers in ending the period with million subscribers 
this brings the total number of subscribers served on the wireless and sprint pcs affiliate networks  including direct  sprint pcs affiliates and wholesale subscribers  to million at year end 
the total number of subscribers at year end reflects an approximate thousand reduction from the previously disclosed number 
this was due to a thousand overstatement of direct subscribers and a thousand overstatement of sprint pcs affiliate subscribers 
subscriber counts reflect activated wireless handsets and other devices  excluding those activated for demonstration or testing purposes 
as a result of internal analysis  sprint recently concluded that previously reported subscriber counts had inadvertently included a limited number of devices used for demonstration or testing purposes  and that this error had occurred over several years 
additional process controls have been established to prevent reoccurrence of this situation and  because the amount of the error is not material to any previously disclosed information  this error has been corrected by adjusting the number of year end subscribers 
wireless had million direct net additions in wholesale partners added million subscribers in  which increased their subscriber base to million from  at the end of  principally driven by virgin mobile usa 
the sprint pcs affiliates added  subscribers in ending the period with million subscribers  bringing the total number of subscribers served on the wireless and sprint pcs affiliate networks  including direct  affiliate and wholesale subscribers  to million at the end of subscriber churn  which is calculated on our direct subscriber base  is computed by dividing the direct subscribers who discontinued pcs service by the weighted average direct subscribers for the period 
this is an operational measure which is used by most wireless companies as a method of estimating the life of the direct subscriber 
analysts and investors primarily use churn to compare relative value across the wireless industry 
in  the subscriber churn rate decreased to from in the slight decrease in was primarily due to improved involuntary churn resulting from improved subscriber payments and collection activity 
subscriber churn rate decreased from to in the improvement was primarily due to a reduction in the involuntary churn rate as wireless benefited from credit management policies initiated in the fourth quarter 
this improvement was partially offset by a slight increase in voluntary churn due in part to the institution of wlnp in the fourth quarter of average monthly service revenue per user arpu  calculated on our direct subscriber base  is computed by dividing direct wireless service revenues by weighted average monthly direct wireless subscribers to measure revenue on a per user basis 
this is a measure which uses gaap as the basis for the calculation 
arpu  which is used by most wireless companies  is a method of valuing recurring subscriber revenue and is used by analysts and investors to compare relative value across the wireless industry 
net operating revenues include direct wireless service revenues from the direct subscriber base  revenues from sales of handsets and accessory equipment  and revenues from our wholesale partners and sprint pcs affiliates 
service revenues consist of monthly recurring charges  usage charges  and miscellaneous fees such as directory assistance  operator assisted calling  handset insurance and late payment charges 
in  sprint saw increased pricing pressures and lower overage charges from usage based plans  which were more than offset by an increase in the number of subscribers  increased revenues from data services and subscriber elections to add services to their base plans 
average monthly usage in was hours compared to hours in at the end of  of the direct wireless base was subscribing to data services compared to at the end of service revenues increased in mainly reflecting an increase in the number of direct subscribers  increased revenue from data services and subscriber elections to add services to their base plans 
these increases were partially offset by lower overage charges from usage based plans 
service revenues increased in mainly reflecting an increase in the number of subscribers  increased revenues from data services and increased fees 
these increases were partially offset by lower overage charges from higher usage service plans 
revenues from sales of handsets and accessories  including new subscribers and upgrades  were approximately of net operating revenues in  in  and in the increase was mainly due to higher subscriber additions and higher retail prices  which were partially offset by higher rebates 
the declines were mainly due to higher rebates and lower gross additions 
as part of the wireless marketing plans  handsets  net of rebates  are usually sold at prices below cost 
wholesale  affiliate and other service revenues consist primarily of net revenues retained from wireless subscribers residing in sprint pcs affiliate territories  and revenues from the sale of our wireless services by companies that resell those services to their subscribers on a retail basis 
these revenues represented of net operating revenues in  in  and in the and increases mainly reflect the net additions from the wholesale and sprint pcs affiliate bases 
cost of services and products costs of services and products mainly include handset and accessory costs  switch and cell site expenses  customer service costs and other network related costs 
these costs increased in and in the increases were primarily due to network support of a larger subscriber base  higher minutes of use  expanded market coverage and increased handset costs 
these increases were somewhat offset by decreases in information technology expense 
handset and equipment costs were of total costs of services and products in each of  and costs of services and products were of net operating revenue in  in  and in selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative sg a expense mainly includes sales  distribution and marketing costs to promote products and services  as well as salary  benefit and other administrative costs 
sg a expense increased in compared to a decrease of in the increase reflects an increase in sales and distribution costs primarily driven by higher gross additions and an increase in the number of direct retail stores 
marketing costs also contributed to the increase as a significant campaign was launched to reposition the sprint pcs brand 
the decrease was primarily due to a decline in bad debt expense due to an improved credit class mix  leading to lower write offs and higher recovery 
this decrease was partially offset by increases in other sales and marketing costs due to more competitive market conditions and expanded direct sales presence and the executive separation agreements

interest rate risk management fair value hedges sprint enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to interest rate movements and achieve an optimal mixture of floating and fixed rate debt while minimizing liquidity risk 
the interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges effectively convert sprint s fixed rate debt to a floating rate by receiving fixed rate amounts in exchange for floating rate interest payments over the life of the agreement without an exchange of the underlying principal amount 
during  sprint entered into interest rate swap agreements  which were designated as fair value hedges 
cash flow hedges sprint enters into interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges to reduce the impact of interest rate movements on future interest expense by effectively converting a portion of its floating rate debt to a fixed rate

the remaining contracts will settle in foreign exchange risk management sprint s foreign exchange risk management program focuses on reducing transaction exposure to optimize consolidated cash flow 
sprint s primary transaction exposure results from payments made to and received from overseas telecommunications companies for completing international calls made by sprint s domestic customers and from the operation of its international subsidiaries 
these international operations were not material to the consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows at year end sprint has not entered into any significant foreign currency forward contracts or other derivative instruments to reduce the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange rates

recently issued accounting pronouncements in march  the eitf of the financial accounting standards board reached a consensus on eitf no 
 participating securities and the two class method under sfas no 
 earnings per share eitf no 

this guidance requires that the rights of securities to participate in the earnings of an enterprise must be reflected in the reporting of earnings per share 
sprint s equity unit purchase contracts met the participating security qualifications outlined in the guidance  because the purchase contracts included a provision permitting the equity unit holders to benefit from or participate in any dividends declared on the common stock during the contract period 
sprint adopted eitf no 
in the second quarter 
prior to april   the equity unit forward purchase contracts were tied only to the pcs common stock which had no earnings upon which to declare dividends 
upon recombination and until settlement in august  the equity unit purchase contracts participated in the earnings of fon common stock 
the proportionate share of earnings attributable to these securities was million in the year to date period 
this attribution was reflected as earnings allocated to participating securities on the face of the consolidated statements of operations 
sprint has no outstanding participating securities at december  in december  the fasb issued sfas no

as amended by sfas no 
 using the prospective method 
upon adoption sprint began expensing the fair value of stock based compensation for all grants  modifications or settlements made on or after january  further  in connection with the tracking stock recombination  as required by sfas no 
 sprint accounted for the conversion of pcs stock options to fon stock options as a modification and accordingly applied stock option expensing to fon stock options resulting from the conversion of pcs stock options granted before january  the revised standard will require sprint to begin to recognize compensation cost for unvested fon stock options granted before january   which are outstanding as of july  this requirement to recognize expense on additional unvested grants is not expected to be significant to sprint 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk sprint is susceptible to certain risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the risk inherent in sprint s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in those factors 
sprint does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk the communications industry is a capital intensive  technology driven business 
sprint is subject to interest rate risk primarily associated with its borrowings 
sprint selectively enters into interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate changes on its debt 
approximately of sprint s debt at december  was fixed rate debt excluding interest rate swaps 
while changes in interest rates impact the fair value of this debt  there is no impact to earnings and cash flows because sprint intends to hold these obligations to maturity unless market and other conditions are favorable 
as of december   sprint held fair value interest rate swaps with a notional value of billion 
these swaps were entered into as hedges of the fair value of a portion of our senior notes 
these interest rate swaps have maturities ranging from to on a semiannual basis  sprint pays a floating rate of interest equal to the six month libor plus a fixed spread and receives an average interest rate equal to the coupon rates stated on the underlying senior notes 
on december   the rate sprint would pay averaged and the rate sprint would receive was 
assuming a one percentage point increase in the prevailing forward yield curve  the fair value of the interest rate swaps and the underlying senior notes would change by million 
these interest rate swaps met all the requirements for perfect effectiveness under derivative accounting rules as all of the critical terms of the swaps perfectly matched the corresponding terms of the hedged debt  therefore  there is no impact to earnings and cash flows for any fair value fluctuations 
sprint performs interest rate sensitivity analyses on its variable rate debt including interest rate swaps 
these analyses indicate that a one percentage point change in interest rates would have an annual pre tax impact of million on the statements of operations and cash flows at december  while sprint s variable rate debt may impact earnings and cash flows as interest rates change  it is not subject to changes in fair values 
sprint also performs a sensitivity analysis on the fair market value of its outstanding debt 
a decline in market interest rates would cause a million increase in fair market value of its debt to billion 
this analysis includes the hedged debt 
foreign currency risk sprint also enters into forward contracts and options in foreign currencies to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates 
sprint uses foreign currency derivatives to hedge its foreign currency exposure related to settlement of international telecommunications access charges and the operation of its international subsidiaries 
the dollar equivalent of sprint s net foreign currency payables from international settlements was million and net foreign currency receivables from international operations was million at december  the potential immediate pre tax loss to sprint that would result from a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates based on these positions would be approximately million
