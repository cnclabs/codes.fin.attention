item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive summary nature of business 
the company  through its subsidiaries  including fsi  is a fully integrated  self administered reit 
on august   the company entered into definitive agreements to merge with cnlrp and the income funds 
pursuant to a merger agreement  cnlrp and the income funds will merge with and into the company 
the transactions are subject to approval from the cnlrp stockholders  the company stockholders and the limited partners of each of the cnl income funds 
the transactions are subject to securing adequate financing and customary regulatory approvals 
notwithstanding the merger transaction  the company s core business strategy for its real estate operations focuses primarily on acquiring  owning and leasing restaurant properties 
in addition  from time to time  opportunistic investments are made in mortgage notes issued by third parties 
the company also owns and leases a number of service station properties  most of which include convenience stores c gs and some of which include car washes 
further  the company acquires properties in its trs with the intention of reselling them rather than holding them for investment properties 
these properties are classified as held for sale 
at december   the company s portfolio consisted of properties with over tenants 
the company leases its properties on a triple net basis primarily to operators of quick service and full service chain restaurants affiliated with major national or regional brands such as applebee s  arby s  burger king  captain d s  chili s  dairy queen  hardee s  pizza hut  popeyes  shoney s and taco cabana 
the company s c g tenants are affiliated with oil brands such as exxon mobil  phillips and shell 
under the triple net leases  tenants are responsible for property operating costs  including property taxes  insurance  maintenance  and in most cases  the ground rents where applicable 
the triple net lease structure is designed to provide a predictable stream of income while minimizing ongoing operating costs associated with properties 
the company s revenues consist primarily of real estate and retail operating revenue 
approximately of the company s leases provide for a base rent plus a percentage of the sales in excess of a specified amount 
as a result  portions of the company revenues are a function of the number of properties in operation and their level of sales 
sales at individual properties are influenced by local market conditions  the efforts of specific operators  marketing  new product programs  support of the franchisor and the general state of the economy 
in  the company formed fsi  one of its taxable reit subsidiaries  through which it began interim operations of various retail businesses at some of its properties 
retail operations are administered by fsi  a wholly owned subsidiary of usrp holding corp 
holding 
holding is a taxable reit subsidiary of usrp 
fsi incurred net operating income in that was offset by net operating losses nols 
the company consolidates its taxable reit subsidiaries and therefore  these nols will also be used to offset income from the other consolidated subsidiaries 
the company plans to continue to maintain its retail operating capability to transition the company s properties from one tenant to another where appropriate 
at december   fsi operated nine c gs  two restaurants and one laundromat and sold fuel through other operators 
during  fsi ceased selling fuel on a wholesale basis to the independent dealers 
cash reserves 
the company is organized to operate as an equity reit that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders  in the form of monthly or quarterly cash distributions  a substantial portion of its net cash flow generated from leases on its properties 
management intends to retain  or through its revolving credit facility  access to an appropriate amount of cash for working capital 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents totaling million and availability under its credit facility of million 
at february   availability under the credit facility was million 
the credit facility  which is scheduled to mature on october   is expected to be used to acquire additional retail properties and for other corporate purposes 
the company has million of unsecured notes payable that are due may   which will be paid off with proceeds from the merger financing 
on october   the company signed a commitment letter for a bridge loan facility in the amount of million 
in the event of a delay or cancellation of the merger with cnlrp and the income funds  the bridge facility combined with borrowing under the credit facility would be used for the refinance of the company s existing senior unsecured notes 
the bridge facility would mature months from the date of funding  carry an interest rate of libor plus and be secured by a negative pledge from the borrowing base entity 
the company paid a up front commitment fee of  for the bridge facility which is being amortized over the day commitment period 
management believes that the company s cash and cash equivalents on hand  cash provided from operating activities and property sales  along with its borrowing capacity are sufficient to meet its liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
series b and b preferred merger 
under terms of the series b and series b preferred stock  the consummation of the merger would constitute a triggering event 
a triggering event allows the stockholder to elect to receive a triggering redemption amount  which is equal to of the stated value 
alternatively  the holders may elect to convert their preferred shares to the common stock of the company at a price equal to per share for the series b preferred and per share for the series b preferred  subject to adjustment 
the company has not received any communication from the series b and b holders as to election intentions

index to financial statements during  the company sold or disposed of properties for net proceeds of million and notes receivable of million  resulting in a net gain of million  which is included in the consolidated statements of operations as income from discontinued operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management of the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on a regular basis  the company evaluates these estimates  including asset impairment and provision for doubtful accounts 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
financial statement captions that could be affected by these types of estimates include property  net receivables including net notes receivable and net mortgage loans receivable  revenues and operating expenses 
revenue recognition the company derives its real estate revenues primarily from the leasing of its properties to operators primarily restaurants on a triple net basis 
triple net leases typically require the tenants to be responsible for property operating costs  including property taxes  insurance  maintenance and  in some cases  the ground rents  where applicable 
accordingly  the accompanying consolidated financial statements have not reflected property taxes and insurance costs or reimbursement revenues where the tenant legally assumed responsibility for these liabilities 
as the company remains legally responsible for ground rents under its ground leases and receives payment from its tenants for these costs  amounts reimbursed from tenants for ground rents are recorded as rent revenue 
the company recognized revenues associated with ground lease reimbursements of million  million and million  of which   and million are reflected in the company s consolidated statements of operations as income from discontinued operations for the years ended december   and  respectively 
rent revenues and expenses under operating leases are recognized on a straight line basis  unless significant collection problems occur with the lessee  at which time rents are recorded on a cash basis 
indicators of possible doubtful collection may include bankruptcy filings and anticipated work out agreements 
in addition  if the company has collected no payments on a particular receivable for over five months  revenue would be recorded on a cash basis as well 
once a tenant has been placed on cash basis accounting  it remains on that basis until there have been several months of on time payments received 
contingent rent is recognized as revenue after the related lease sales targets are achieved 
interest income on notes and mortgages receivable is recorded on an accrual basis 
however  when circumstances indicate that the ultimate collection of interest is doubtful  interest is recorded on a cash basis 
the company derives its retail revenues from the sale of gasoline and car washes through c gs operated by the company s fsi subsidiary and other operators  and from convenience store merchandise and food sales at restaurants also operated by fsi 
revenue is recognized upon the sale of gasoline  merchandise and the delivery of services 
asset impairment the company s management routinely reviews its investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
indicators of possible impairment include default of lease terms  non payment or late payment of rents  decreases in tenant s sales levels and general declines in the success of the operating brand names of its tenants 
when these indicators are present  the company reviews the circumstances and  if an impairment is necessary because the estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the net carrying amount of the asset  determines an estimate of the fair market value of the property affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company regularly analyzes its receivables on an individual basis for collectibility and the related reserves are analyzed for adequacy 
accounts receivable balances that are  or more and have been outstanding for days or more are reviewed 
all balances due from these tenants are reviewed and evaluated  including rent receivables  notes receivable  mortgage loans receivable  interest receivable and straight line rent receivables 
all information regarding the creditworthiness of the tenants and debtors are reviewed  including bankruptcy filings and sales reports 
company policy is to individually review at least of the accounts receivable that are over days past due  with the remaining past due amounts analyzed on an aggregate basis 
once a reserve has been established for a tenant or debtor  the company maintains that reserve until there has been a proven history of cash payment performance 
after at least two months of cash payments  the circumstances pertaining to the tenant or debtor are reevaluated to estimate the ultimate collectibility of the receivable 
receivables are written off only with the written approval of a member of the executive management of the company 
each note and mortgage loan receivable with amounts past due for over five months or which are otherwise problematic or of concern due to other factors are included in the analysis 
the company evaluates its notes and mortgage loans receivables in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
a note or mortgage is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
when a loan is impaired  the amount of the impairment is measured based on the excess of the recorded investment in the loan over either the present value of expected future cash flows including costs to sell  if applicable discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent or if foreclosure is probable 
a loan is collateral dependent if the repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral 
impairments are recognized by creating a valuation allowance with a corresponding charge to the provision for doubtful accounts or by adjusting an existing valuation allowance for the impaired loan with a corresponding charge or credit to the provision for doubtful accounts 

table of contents 
index to financial statements subsequent to the initial measurement of impairment  the company recalculates the impairment and adjusts the valuation allowance if there is a significant change in the amount or timing of an impaired loan s expected future cash flows or the fair value of the collateral or if actual cash flows are significantly different from the cash flows previously projected

index to financial statements funds from operations ffo the company believes the supplemental non gaap measure ffo is a useful indicator of the company s operating performance and that the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to ffo is net income 
management uses ffo as a supplemental measure to conduct and evaluate the business because there are certain limitations associated with using gaap net income by itself as the primary measure of the company s operating performance 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  management believes that the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting is insufficient by itself 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit created ffo as a supplemental performance measure to exclude historical cost depreciation  among other items  from gaap net income 
the company s ffo is computed as net income available to common stockholders computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  income loss allocable to minority interest holders and extraordinary items and is computed in accordance with the nareit white paper definition of ffo 
the company believes that the use of ffo  combined with the required primary gaap presentations  has improved management s and the investing public s understanding of reit operating results 
further  the use of ffo has made comparisons of those results more meaningful and has enabled the evaluation of the company s operating performance compared to other reits that use the nareit definition in order to make more informed business decisions based on industry trends or conditions 
therefore  the company considers ffo a useful measure for reviewing its comparative operating and financial performance because  by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization  ffo assists in the comparison of the operating performance of real estate between periods or as compared to other reits 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as the primary indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
while the company adheres to the nareit definition of ffo in making its calculation  the company s method of calculating ffo may not be comparable to the methods used by other reits and accordingly may be different from similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
the following table sets forth ffo for the years ended december   and years ended december  dollars in thousands net income allocable to common stockholders real estate depreciation and amortization continuing operations discontinued operations gain on sale of properties discontinued operations cumulative effect of change in accounting principle adjustments allocable to minority interests ffo basic income allocable to minority interests adjustments allocable to minority interests ffo diluted beginning in the second quarter of the company began a program of purchasing real estate with the intent of re sale

if all of the company s fina stores were permanently not open and operating under the fina brand  the company s maximum liability would be approximately million as of december  lyon s of california the company has significant mortgage loans and a note receivable due from lyon s of california  inc lyon s secured by four lyon s restaurant properties 
as a result of the bankruptcy filings of lyon s  interest income associated with these notes had not been recognized since september all of the notes are valued based on the estimated fair value of the collateral  as collateral disposal is one of the primary means through which the company will collect on its outstanding balance 
at december   the company had million of net mortgage loans  a  note receivable and  of other receivables due from lyon s 
in april  fsi entered into a management agreement with lyon s  whereby fsi would provide management oversight of the lyon s brand name and franchise system 
the company also provided employees necessary to operate the four lyon s corporate operated restaurants through the november termination of the agreement 
compensation to fsi under the management agreement included an annual management fee and full reimbursement  including an administrative charge  for labor costs related to the employees supplied to the four corporate operated restaurants

inflation while a few of the company s leases are subject to adjustments for increases in the consumer price index  the majority of the leases contain fixed escalation clauses which reduce the risk to the company of the adverse effects of inflation relative to fixed rent leases 
additionally  to the extent inflation increases tenant s sales volume  percentage rents may tend to offset the effects of inflation on the company 
because triple net leases also require the restaurant operator to pay for some or all operating expenses  property taxes  property repair and maintenance costs including environmental costs and insurance  some or all of the inflationary impact of these expenses will be borne by the property operator and not by the company 
inflation does impact the company through the purchase of gasoline by the retail segment 
seasonality restaurant operations historically have been seasonal in nature  reflecting higher unit sales during the second and third quarters due to warmer weather and increased leisure travel 
this seasonality can be expected to cause fluctuations in the company s quarterly revenue to the extent it recognizes percentage rent 
new accounting pronouncements inventory costs in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  which amends chapter of arb no 
that deals with inventory pricing 
the statement clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expenses  freight  handling costs  and spoilage 
under previous guidance  paragraph of arb no 
 chapter  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs might be considered to be so abnormal  under certain circumstances  as to require treatment as current period charges 
this statement eliminates the criterion of so abnormal and requires that those items be recognized as current period charges 
also  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june   although earlier application is permitted for fiscal years beginning after the date of issuance of this statement 
retroactive application is not permitted 
management is analyzing the requirements of this new statement and believes that its adoption will not have any significant impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows

share based payments in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payments  which establishes accounting standards for all transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions with employees  and carries forward without change prior guidance for share based payments for transactions with non employees 

table of contents 
index to financial statements sfas no 
r eliminates the intrinsic value measurement objective in apb opinion no 
and generally requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant 
the standard requires grant date fair value to be estimated using either an option pricing model which is consistent with the terms of the award or a market observed price  if such a price exists 
such cost must be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award or the requisite service period which is usually the vesting period 
the standard also requires us to estimate the number of instruments that will ultimately be issued  rather than accounting for forfeitures as they occur 
the company is required to apply sfas no 
r to all awards granted  modified or settled in our first reporting period beginning after june  we are also required to use either the modified prospective method or the modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  we must recognize compensation cost for all awards granted after we adopt the standard and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that are outstanding on that date 
under the modified retrospective method  we must restate our previously issued financial statements to recognize the amounts we previously calculated and reported on a pro forma basis  as if the prior standard had been adopted 
under both methods  we are permitted to use either a straight line or an accelerated method to amortize the cost as an expense for awards with graded vesting 
the standard permits and encourages early adoption 
we have commenced our analysis of the impact of sfas r  but have not yet decided whether we will elect to adopt early  if we elect to adopt early  then at what date we would do so  whether we will use the modified prospective method or elect to use the modified retrospective method  and whether we will elect to use straight line amortization or an accelerated method 
accordingly  we cannot currently quantify with precision the effect that this standard would have on our financial position or results of operations in the future  except that the company probably will recognize a greater expense for any awards that we may grant in the future than we would using the current guidance 
if we were to adopt sfas no 
r using the modified retrospective method  our net income would have been approximately  less in the year ended december  and approximately  less in the year ended december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks that arise in the ordinary course of business 
the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk  but does not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for trading purposes  nor does the company have any foreign operations and thus is not exposed to foreign currency fluctuations 
a discussion of the company s primary market risk exposure is presented below 
market risk on investments the fair value of the company s investment portfolio would be negatively affected by an increase in interest rates 
since the majority of the company s investments are interest bearing and therefore subject to the market risk of loss from a decline in rates  the company s future earnings and cash flows could be affected adversely 
however  at december   the company s investment portfolio has been reduced to  and changes in value relating to market risks would not significantly impact the company s operations 
the company also has investments in fixed rate notes and mortgage loans receivable 
changes in interest rates do not have a direct impact on interest income related to these notes and loans 
market risk on variable rate debt the company s interest rate risk is sensitive to interest rate changes on its variable rate debt 
the company had total outstanding debt of million at december   of which approximately million was variable rate debt 
of this amount  million  or was unhedged 
all other things being equal  the interest expense on the company s unhedged variable rate debt will decrease as interest rates decline and will increase as rates rise 
exposure to interest rate risk is generally managed using derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate swaps  in conjunction with a portion of the company s variable rate debt to mitigate the interest rate risk on an associated financial instrument or to lock in an interest rate on its variable rate debt under its credit agreement with bank of america and its triple net lease mortgage certificates 
fair values for the company s derivative instruments were obtained from broker statements 
as it relates to unhedged variable rate debt  if market interest rates average more than in  the impact related to additional annual interest expense would decrease net income and cash flows by million for this amount was determined by calculating the effect of a hypothetical interest rate on the company s unhedged variable rate debt 
this sensitivity analysis assumes that there are no changes in the company s financial structure 
management believes that the fair value of its variable rate debt equals its carrying value at december  and market risk on fixed rate debt the company s long term fixed interest rate debt is also subject to market risk 
fixed rate debt outstanding at december  was million with a weighted average interest rate of 
all other things being equal  the fair market value of the company s fixed rate debt will increase as rates decline and will decrease as rates rise 
the fixed rate notes payable and the mortgage note payable totaling million at december  had a fair value of million based on interest rates for notes with similar terms and remaining maturities which management believes the company could obtain
