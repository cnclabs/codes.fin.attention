item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we begin management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a with an overview to give the reader management s perspective on our results for fiscal and our general outlook for the next fiscal year 
this is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results 
this discussion is followed by a review of our recent  significant acquisitions 
in the next section  we discuss our results of operations for fiscal compared to fiscal and for fiscal compared to fiscal and present information about our operating results by quarter for fiscal and 
table of contents we then discuss the impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements on our future reported results and provide an analysis of our liquidity and capital resources 
finally  we discuss the risks and uncertainties that we believe may adversely affect our business  financial condition and or results of operations in the future 
this md a should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form k  including business and selected financial data above and the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
md a contains a number of forward looking statements  all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in the certain risks and uncertainties section 
our actual results may differ materially from the results indicated by any forward looking statements 
overview during fiscal we continued to emphasize the importance of providing the flexibility that our customers need when it comes to structuring their license arrangements 
reflecting these customer preferences  we again saw an increase in the volume of transactions that required deferral of the license fee and recognition of such fees ratably over the terms of the contracts 
in fiscal  approximately of our license bookings were deferred as compared to approximately in fiscal given the amount of license revenue deferred during fiscal  license bookings remains a key metric for us as it reflects the amount of new license contracts signed during a given period 
license bookings can be calculated from our consolidated financial statements by summing current period license revenues plus the net change in deferred license revenue  both calculated according to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
our license bookings for fiscal declined from fiscal as our distributed systems management and mainframe management businesses had lower license bookings  which paralleled industry performance 
our service management business  the cornerstone of our bsm strategy  experienced strong license bookings growth  primarily due to bookings for products of recently acquired businesses 
given our outlook for it and systems management spending and our expectations for the number and dollar amount of license transactions that will require deferral of revenue  we estimate low single digit license revenue growth in fiscal to address our overall profitability  we implemented a restructuring plan subsequent to march  that we believe will allow us to meet our profitability goals by reducing costs and realigning resources to focus on growth areas 
as part of this fiscal plan  we will reduce investment in product areas that are not at acceptable profitability levels and will reduce selling  general and administrative expenses throughout our organization 
we expect that the actions taken will allow us to increase investment in our service management business  which we believe will provide us future revenue growth  maintain our strong profitability in our mainframe management business and improve our profitability in our distributed systems management business 
this fiscal plan is discussed in greater detail under results of operations below 
another important metric for us is our cash flows from operations  which were million for fiscal we expect to continue to generate significant cash flows from operations  including the positive impact net of severance payments we expect from the profitability improvements discussed above as a result of the fiscal headcount reductions 
the issues affecting our cash flows are discussed in greater detail under liquidity and capital resources below 
in addition to internal development  we continue to look for strategic opportunities to extend our bsm offerings 
to this end  we remained acquisitive during fiscal our more significant business combinations are discussed in greater detail under acquisitions below 
finally  it is important for our investors to understand that a significant portion of our operating expenses is fixed in the short term and we plan our expense run rate based on our expectations of future revenues 
in addition  a significant amount of our license transactions are completed during the final weeks and days of each quarter  and therefore we generally do not know whether revenues will have met our expectations until after the end of the quarter 
if we have a shortfall in revenues in any given quarter  there is an immediate  sometimes significant  effect on our overall earnings 

table of contents industry conditions the worldwide market for spending on it solutions remains weak  and we recognize that some of the markets in which we compete are either not growing or are growing at very low rates 
however  enterprises around the world have a need for integrated systems management software to manage their complex it environments 
we believe that companies that can provide an integrated suite of solutions that align it resources with the needs of the overall business will be rewarded with repeat and new customers 
while we remain optimistic about our business prospects and continue to believe that we are uniquely positioned to be the leading provider of bsm solutions  we recognize that the systems management software marketplace is highly competitive 
we compete with a variety of software vendors  including large vendors such as ibm  hp  computer associates  and a number of smaller software vendors 
we compete for new customers and  from time to time  must compete to maintain our relationships with our current customers 
this competition can lead to pricing pressure and can affect our margins 
we discuss competition in greater detail under certain risks and uncertainties below 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our accounting and financial reporting policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us as required by us gaap  we make and evaluate estimates and judgments on an on going basis  including those related to revenue recognition  capitalized software development costs  intangible assets  valuation of investments and accounting for income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about amounts and timing of revenues and expenses  the carrying values of assets and the recorded amounts of liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and such estimates may change if the underlying conditions or assumptions change 
we have discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies described below with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the related disclosures below 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
these statements provide guidance on applying generally accepted accounting principles to recognizing revenue in software transactions 
in applying these statements  we exercise judgment in the determination of the amount of software license  maintenance  enhancement and support collectively  maintenance and professional services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period 
we recognize software license fees upon meeting all of the following four criteria execution of the signed contract  delivery of the underlying products to the customer and the acceptance of such products by the customer  determination that the software license fees are fixed or determinable and determination that collection of the software license fees is probable 
if we determine that any one of the four criteria is not met  we will defer recognition of the software license revenue until the criteria are met  as required by sops and maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement on a straight line basis 
revenues from license and maintenance transactions that are financed are generally recognized in the same manner as those requiring current payment  as we have a history of offering installment contracts to customers and successfully enforcing original payment terms without making concessions 
because our agents  distributors and resellers collectively  resellers act as the principals in the transactions with the end users of our software and the rewards of ownership are passed to the resellers upon the execution of our arrangements with them  we recognize revenues from transactions with resellers on a net basis the amounts actually received by us from the resellers 
in addition  we do not offer a right of return  rotation or price protection in our sales to resellers  and it is our policy to only accept orders from resellers that specifically name an end user 
on occasion  we have purchased goods or services for our operations from customers at or about the same time 
table of contents that we licensed our software to these customers 
license revenues from such transactions represent less than one percent of our total license revenues in any period 
revenues from professional services are recognized as the services are performed 
when several elements  including software licenses  maintenance and professional services  are sold to a customer through a single contract  the license revenues are recognized under the residual method  such that the consideration is allocated to the various other elements included in the agreement based upon the vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of those elements  with the residual being allocated to the licenses 
revenues allocated to the undelivered elements of a contract are deferred until such time as those elements are delivered  or in the case of maintenance  such revenues are recognized ratably over the maintenance term 
we have established vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of our maintenance through the renewal rates in the contractual arrangements with our customers and through independent sales of maintenance at these stated renewal rates 
these renewal rates reflect a consistent relationship established by pricing maintenance as a percentage of the discounted or undiscounted license list price 
vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of professional services is based on daily rates determined from our contracts for services alone  which are time and materials based 
accordingly  software license fees are recognized under the residual method for arrangements in which the software is licensed with maintenance and or professional services  and where the maintenance and or professional services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered software 
in the event a contract contains multiple elements for which we have not established vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  all revenues from the contract are deferred until such evidence is established or are recognized on a ratable basis 
capitalized software development costs costs of internally developed software are expensed until the technological feasibility of the software product has been established 
thereafter  software development costs are capitalized until the product s general release to customers in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
capitalized software development costs are then amortized over the product s estimated economic life beginning at the date of general availability of the product to our customers 
under sfas no 
 we evaluate our capitalized software costs at each balance sheet date to determine if the unamortized balance related to any given product exceeds the estimated net realizable value of that product 
any such excess is written off through accelerated amortization in the quarter it is identified 
determining net realizable value as defined by sfas no 
requires that we make estimates and use judgment in quantifying the appropriate amount to write off  if any 
actual amounts realized from the software products could differ from our estimates 
also  any future changes to our product portfolio could result in significant increases to our cost of license revenues as a result of software asset write offs 
the impact of accelerated amortization on fiscal  and results is discussed in greater detail under results of operations cost of license revenues below 
acquired technology  in process research and development  goodwill and intangible assets when we acquire a business  a portion of the purchase price is typically allocated to acquired technology  in process research and development and identifiable intangible assets  such as customer relationships 
the excess of our cost over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the amounts allocated to acquired technology  in process research and development and intangible assets represent our estimates of their fair values at the acquisition date 
the fair values are estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method of applying the income approach  which requires us to project the related future revenues and expenses and apply an appropriate discount rate 
once the acquired assets are recorded  we amortize the acquired technology and intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated lives 
we analyze the realizability of our acquired technology each quarter 
all goodwill and those intangibles with indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but rather are tested for impairment annually  and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of an intangible asset or a reporting unit with goodwill has been reduced below carrying value 
when conducting these realizability and impairment assessments  we are required to estimate future cash flows 
the estimates used in 
table of contents valuing all intangible assets  including in process research and development  are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
accordingly  actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value and to estimate useful lives 
incorrect estimates of fair value and or useful lives could result in impairment charges and those charges could be material to our consolidated results of operations 
valuation of investments our investments primarily consist of marketable debt and equity securities 
we account for our marketable investments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
we regularly analyze our portfolio of marketable securities for impairment 
this analysis requires significant judgment 
the primary factors considered when determining if an impairment charge must be recorded because a decline in the fair value of a marketable security is other than temporary include whether i the fair value of the investment is significantly below our cost basis  ii the financial condition of the issuer of the security has deteriorated  iii if a debt security  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the security  iv the decline in fair value has existed for an extended period of time  v if a debt security  such security has been downgraded by a rating agency  and vi we have the intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
we have investment policies which are designed to ensure that our assets are invested in capital preserving securities 
however  from time to time  issuer specific and market specific events  as described above  could warrant an impairment write down 
as the vast majority of our marketable securities are investment grade debt securities  we believe that any future impairment charges related to these investments will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
marketable securities with a fair value below our cost as of march  and are discussed in greater detail in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes we account for the effect of income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 income tax expense or benefit is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year s results and for deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
we are required to make significant assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine i our income tax expense or benefit  ii our deferred tax assets and liabilities and iii whether a valuation allowance should be recorded against our deferred tax assets 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by domestic including state and foreign authorities 
these factors significantly impact the amounts we record related to income taxes 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates related to the realizability of our deferred tax assets take into account positive and negative evidence about possible sources of taxable income available under the tax laws to realize the tax benefit  including projections of the amount and category of future taxable income and the amounts that may be realized utilizing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of taxable income in future years could differ from our estimates and the related impact on our income tax expense or benefit could materially affect our consolidated results of operations 
we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in multiple jurisdictions and our income tax expense includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that may result from the examination of our tax returns that have been filed in these jurisdictions 
determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires significant judgments and estimates 
we evaluate our income tax contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies and have accrued for income tax contingencies that meet both the probable and estimable criteria of sfas no 
we also have various foreign and state income tax exposures that do not meet the probable and or estimable criteria of sfas no 
and therefore no tax expense has been accrued 
the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these exposures 
table of contents could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations 
acquisitions in november  we acquired the assets of remedy from peregrine systems  inc for cash of million plus the assumption of certain liabilities of remedy 
in accordance with the purchase agreement  the cash purchase price was adjusted to million during fiscal integration of remedy s industry leading service desk  change management and asset management capabilities with our broad application and component management solutions enables us to deliver end to end  closed loop service management to customers 
the remedy solutions form the core of our service management business which also includes the magic and marimba solutions discussed below 
the acquisition of it masters in march for cash of million enhances our competitive position in the service management market 
in accordance with the purchase agreement  the cash purchase price was adjusted to million during fiscal it masters technology combines powerful event automation and service modeling capabilities to transform availability and performance data into detailed knowledge about the status of business services and service level agreements 
in february  we acquired the assets of magic from network associates for cash of million plus the assumption of certain liabilities of magic 
the acquisition strengthens our leadership position in the service management market by increasing our reach to small and mid market sized organizations  as magic had more than  customers using its service desk solutions 
the acquisition of marimba in july for million in cash plus stock options valued at million provides new and extended capabilities to our bsm offerings in the areas of change and configuration management  security management and infrastructure management  enabling our customers to rapidly respond to changing business requirements by re purposing  re provisioning and updating it resources to achieve required it configurations 
in january  we acquired calendra for million in cash  and in march  we acquired the assets of opennetwork for cash of million plus the assumption of certain liabilities of opennetwork 
these two acquisitions complete our transition from being a point product provider in the identity management market to a complete suite provider 
the combination of our control sa provisioning solution with calendra s state of the art business process centric workflow and directory management capabilities  eliminates integration issues typically faced by customers purchasing individual components from multiple vendors 
the opennetwork acquisition expands our identity management product suite to include browser based authentication and authorization solutions that enable customers to securely manage access to web based applications across multiple business environments 
these transactions  along with various other immaterial technology acquisitions  have been accounted for using the purchase accounting method  and accordingly  the financial results for these entities have been included in our consolidated financial results since the applicable acquisition dates 
historical information historical performance should not be viewed as indicative of future performance  as there can be no assurance that operating income loss or net earnings loss will be sustained at these levels 
for a discussion of factors affecting operating results  see certain risks and uncertainties below 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentages that selected items in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss bear to total revenues

table of contents revenues we generate revenues from licensing software  providing maintenance  enhancement and support for previously licensed products and providing professional services 
we generally utilize written contracts as the means to establish the terms and conditions by which our products  support and services are sold to our customers 
percentage change years ended march  compared to compared to in millions license domestic international total license revenues maintenance domestic international total maintenance revenues professional services domestic international total professional services revenues total revenues fiscal compared to fiscal we acquired remedy in november and magic in february  as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
excluding the impact of remedy and magic revenues subsequent to the acquisition dates  total revenues declined in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of a significant increase in license revenue deferrals 
license revenues during the first six months of fiscal were negatively impacted by reduced it spending by many of our customers  but customers were more willing to consider new it projects and to commit to larger transactions during the second half of fiscal the number of license transactions over million during the second half of fiscal increased over the prior year  including nine license transactions over million  eight of which are being recognized over the lives of the contracts 
see further detail of the impact of the net change in deferred license revenue under product license revenues below 
including remedy and magic revenues subsequent to the acquisition dates  total revenues increased in fiscal product revenue growth was not materially impacted by inflation in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal we acquired marimba and other smaller companies in fiscal  as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
excluding the impact of companies acquired in fiscal and  total revenues declined in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of a decline in license revenues 
weakness in it spending and customer procurement process slowdowns early in fiscal and lower license bookings for our distributed systems business contributed to this decline 
including revenues of acquired companies  total revenues increased in fiscal product revenue growth was not materially impacted by inflation in fiscal 
table of contents product license revenues our product license revenues primarily consist of fees related to products licensed to customers on a perpetual basis 
product license fees can be associated with a customer s licensing of a given software product for the first time or with a customer s purchase of the right to run a previously licensed product on additional computing capacity or to add users 
our license revenues also include term license fees which are generated when customers are granted license rights to a given software product for a defined period of time 
license bookings reflect the amount of new license contracts signed during a given period  and are calculated as recognized license revenues plus the net change in deferred license revenue for the period 
license bookings for fiscal and were up and down  respectively  from the prior year periods 
we closed license transactions over million during fiscal  including two transaction over million  a decrease from such transactions  including four over million  in fiscal and an increase from such transactions in fiscal  including two transactions over million 
the total license bookings value of these transactions in fiscal was million  including amounts recognized and deferred  compared to million and million for these transactions in fiscal and  respectively 
for fiscal  and  our recognized revenues were impacted by the changes in our deferred license revenue balance as follows year ended march  in millions deferrals of license revenue recognition from deferred license revenue net impact on recognized license revenue deferred license revenue balance at end of year we expect that our deferred license revenue balance will continue to grow in the near term 
the primary reasons for license revenue deferrals include customer transactions that include certain complex contractual terms and conditions  customer transactions that include products with different maintenance pricing methodologies  such as a license covering both remedy products and other bmc software products  and customer transactions that include products with differing maintenance periods 
in each of these instances  we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the maintenance and or professional services in the transaction  which causes the license revenues to be deferred under the residual method of accounting for multiple element arrangements 
in addition  we defer license revenues for time based licenses with terms of less than five years 
the contract terms and conditions that result in deferral of revenue recognition for a given transaction result from arm s length negotiations between us and our customers 
we anticipate our transactions will increasingly include such contract terms that result in deferral of the related license revenues as we expand our offerings to meet customers product  pricing and licensing needs 
once it is determined that license revenues for a particular contract must be deferred  based on the contractual terms and application of revenue recognition requirements to those terms  we recognize such license revenue either ratably over the term of the contract or when the revenue recognition criteria are met 
because of this  we generally know the timing of the subsequent recognition of license revenue at the time of deferral 
therefore  the amount of license revenues to be recognized out of the deferred revenue balance in each future quarter is generally predictable  and our total license revenues to be recognized each quarter become more predictable as a larger percentage of those revenues come from the deferred license revenue balance 
as of march   the average remaining life of the deferred license revenue balance was approximately three years 
of the total deferred license revenue balance at march   we estimate that we will recognize license revenues of million  million and million  for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal and thereafter  respectively 

table of contents our domestic operations generated  and of total license revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
domestic license revenues decreased from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal excluding the impact of acquisitions  domestic license revenues decreased in fiscal and in fiscal domestic license revenues for the mainframe data management product line declined and in fiscal and  respectively 
domestic license revenues for the patrol product line declined and in fiscal and  respectively 
the overall decline for fiscal was primarily due to the impact of deferred license revenues as discussed above  as well as an overall decrease in license bookings in the region 
in fiscal  the increase in domestic license revenues for our service management products only partially offset the revenue declines above 
domestic license bookings were also down in fiscal international license revenues represented  and of total license revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
international license revenues increased from fiscal to fiscal and decreased from fiscal to fiscal excluding the impact of acquisitions  international license revenues decreased in fiscal and in fiscal international license revenues increased for our patrol products and for our scheduling and output management products in fiscal these increases were more than offset by a decrease in our mainframe data management products and a decrease for our mainview products 
these decreases were primarily due to the impact of increased deferred license revenue  as discussed above 
in fiscal  the declines were across all product lines other than service management and resulted primarily from weakness in certain international locations 
foreign currency exchange rate changes increased international license revenues and for fiscal and  respectively  net of hedging 
excluding this currency impact  international license revenues decreased and for fiscal and  respectively 
maintenance  enhancement and support revenues maintenance revenues represent the ratable recognition of fees to enroll licensed products in our software maintenance  enhancement and support program 
maintenance enrollment generally entitles customers to product enhancements  technical support services and ongoing compatibility with third party operating systems  database management systems  networks  storage systems and applications 
annual maintenance fees are based on a percentage of the undiscounted license list price for remedy and magic products and the discounted license list price for other bmc software products 
customers are generally entitled to reduced annual maintenance percentages for entering into long term maintenance contracts 
the majority of our maintenance revenues are generated by such long term contracts 
maintenance revenues also include the ratable recognition of the bundled fees for any initial maintenance services covered by the related license agreement 
maintenance revenues increased in fiscal and in fiscal  primarily as a result of the additional maintenance revenue associated with acquired products and the continuing growth in the base of installed service management products 
maintenance fees increase with new license and maintenance agreements and as existing customers install our products on additional processing capacity or add users 
however  discounts on licensed products tend to increase at higher levels of processing capacity  so that maintenance fees on a per unit of capacity basis are typically reduced in enterprise license agreements 
these discounts  combined with an increase in long term maintenance contracts with reduced maintenance percentages and our license bookings performance excluding our service management products  have led to low growth rates for our maintenance revenues excluding our service management products 
of the total deferred maintenance revenue balance at march   we expect to recognize maintenance revenues of million  million  and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal and thereafter  respectively 

table of contents product line revenues percentage change years ended march  compared to compared to in millions mainframe management mainframe data management mainview distributed systems management patrol distributed systems data management scheduling output management service management nm identity management other total license maintenance revenues not meaningful our solutions are broadly divided into four core product categories 
the mainframe management product category includes products designed for managing database management systems on mainframe platforms 
the distributed systems management product category includes our systems management and monitoring  distributed data management  scheduling and output management solutions 
the service management product category includes our service  change and asset management  it discovery and software configuration management solutions 
the identity management product category includes products that facilitate user administration and provisioning  password administration  enterprise directory management  web access control and audit and compliance management 
our mainframe management solutions combined represented  and of total software revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
total software revenues for this group declined from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal in fiscal  license and maintenance revenues decreased for the mainframe data management product line primarily due to increased deferrals of license revenues along with decreased license bookings due to increased competition and slower capacity growth 
mainview license and maintenance revenues also declined in fiscal due to increased discounts 
the decline in fiscal included license and maintenance revenue declines for the mainview product line 
our past success in displacing ibm s candle products has reduced current opportunities for this product line 
at the same time  customer demand for capacity has slowed 
mainframe data management license revenues also decreased consistent with the overall trends in the mainframe market 
our distributed systems management solutions combined contributed  and of total software revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
total software revenues for this group declined from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal for fiscal  a large increase in the net change in deferred license revenues for the patrol and scheduling output management product lines offset the increases in license bookings for these products 
this  together with a decrease in license revenues for our distributed systems data management product line more than offset the increase in maintenance revenues for the patrol and scheduling output management product lines 
for fiscal  license bookings were down across all product lines in this category  resulting in decreased license revenues 
table of contents which more than offset maintenance revenue increases for all product lines 
the decline in license bookings was primarily for our distributed systems data management products as a result of increased competition from database providers in this market and for our patrol products as we are undergoing a product transition for this product line  integrating our agent based and agentless patrol technologies 
our service management solutions contributed of total software revenues for fiscal  including remedy revenues for the period from the acquisition date of november  through march  and the impact of the purchase accounting write down of the remedy acquisition date deferred maintenance revenue 
revenues from our service management products contributed and of total software revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
as the acquisition of remedy was completed during the third quarter of fiscal  a comparison of fiscal to is not meaningful 
total software revenues for this group increased from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to the acquisitions of magic and marimba in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the second quarter of fiscal  respectively  and growth of remedy s core business 
our identity management solutions contributed  and of total software revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
total software revenues for this group decreased from fiscal to fiscal and decreased from fiscal to fiscal the decrease in fiscal was a result of increased competitive pressures 
an increase in maintenance revenues was more than offset by a decline in license revenues for the year 
during fiscal  the identity management market continued to experience consolidation and  as such  many of our competitors were able to offer integrated solution suites  which customers are choosing over the point products we provided 
our acquisitions of calendra in january and opennetwork in march completed our transition from being a point product provider in the identity management market to a complete suite provider

table of contents fiscal exit activities and related costs during fiscal  we implemented a restructuring plan that included the involuntary termination of approximately employees  primarily during the first half of the year 
the workforce reduction was across all functions and geographies and affected employees were provided cash separation packages 
we also exited leases in certain locations  reduced the square footage required to operate some locations and relocated some operations to lower cost facilities 
charges for exit costs of million were recorded in fiscal  for employee severance and related costs and exited leases 
additionally  million of incremental depreciation expense was recorded during the year  related to changes in estimated depreciable lives for leasehold improvements in locations exited and for certain information technology assets that were eliminated as a result of the plan 
these changes in estimated lives reduced basic and diluted earnings per share by for fiscal the expenses related to the exit activities are reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss for fiscal as follows severance related incremental year ended march  costs facilities depreciation total in millions cost of license revenues cost of maintenance revenues cost of professional services selling and marketing expenses research and development expenses general and administrative expenses total included in operating expenses as of march   million of severance and facilities costs related to actions completed under the plan remained accrued for payment in future periods  as follows balance at cash payments  balance at march  charged to adjustments net of sublease march  expense accretion to estimates income in millions severance and related costs facilities costs total accrual balance at effect of cash payments  balance at march  adjustments exchange rate net of sublease march  accretion to estimates changes income in millions severance and related costs facilities costs total accrual the amounts accrued at march  related to facilities costs represent the remaining fair value of lease obligations for exited locations  as determined at the cease use dates for those facilities  net of estimated sublease income that could be reasonably obtained in the future  and will be paid out over the remaining lease terms  the last of which ends in fiscal we do not expect any significant additional severance or facilities charges related to this plan subsequent to march   other than potential adjustments to lease accruals based on actual subleases differing from estimates 

table of contents cost of license revenues beginning in fiscal  we have presented the cost of license revenues separately in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
all periods presented have been reclassified for consistency 
the cost of license revenues is primarily comprised of the amortization of capitalized software development costs and the amortization of acquired technology obtained through business combinations 
the cost of license revenues for fiscal and also included a portion of the severance and facilities costs related to exit activities discussed under fiscal exit activities and related costs above and in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the cost of license revenues was  and of license revenues for fiscal  and  respectively  and consisted of the following years ended march  in millions amortization of capitalized software development costs amortization of acquired technology expenses related to exit activities other as discussed under critical accounting policies above  we capitalize software development costs in accordance with sfas no 
the following table summarizes the amounts capitalized and amortized during fiscal  and amortization for these periods includes amounts accelerated for certain software products that were not expected to generate sufficient future revenues to realize the carrying value of the assets 
years ended march  in millions software development costs capitalized total amortization net impact on operating expenses accelerated amortization included in total amortization above we reviewed our product portfolio during fiscal and fiscal and discontinued certain products 
to the extent that there were any capitalized software development costs remaining on the balance sheet related to these products  we accelerated the amortization to write off these balances 
the continued need to accelerate amortization to maintain our capitalized software costs at net realizable value  the results of the valuation performed for the remedy acquisition that indicated a three year life was appropriate for that acquired technology and changes in the average life cycles for certain of our software products caused us to evaluate the estimated economic lives for our internally developed software products 
as a result of this evaluation  we revised the estimated economic lives of certain products as of january   such that most products at that date would be amortized over an estimated life of three years 
these changes in estimated economic lives resulted in an additional million and million of amortization expense in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and reduced basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended march  and by per share and per share  respectively 
the decrease in software development cost capitalization from fiscal to fiscal is due to the overall reduction in research and development headcount in early fiscal  expansion of our operations into different locations and two significant products becoming generally available during the third fiscal quarter of during fiscal  capitalization has increased from those reduced levels as development has increased  especially in the service management area  including acquisitions 
lower amounts capitalized in fiscal  coupled with mature products becoming fully amortized and reduced amounts of accelerated amortization  have led to reduced amortization expense during fiscal 
table of contents cost of maintenance revenues beginning in fiscal  we have presented the cost of maintenance revenues separately in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
all periods presented have been reclassified for consistency 
the cost of maintenance revenues is primarily comprised of the costs associated with the customer support and research and development personnel that provide maintenance  enhancement and support services to our customers 
the cost of maintenance revenues for fiscal and also included a portion of the severance and facilities costs related to exit activities discussed under exit activities and related costs above and in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the cost of maintenance was  and of maintenance revenues for fiscal  and  respectively  and consisted of the following years ended march  in millions cost of maintenance services expenses related to exit activities other as a percent of maintenance revenues  cost of maintenance revenues increased in fiscal and decreased in fiscal primarily as a result of the expenses related to exit activities in fiscal  as discussed above 
the headcount reductions associated with the exit activities were completed during the first half of fiscal and therefore the cost of maintenance services in the table above reflects the positive impact of these reductions for a portion of fiscal a full year of benefit was realized in fiscal  which was partially offset by increases in costs for headcount added during the year from expansion into different locations and from acquisitions 
cost of professional services the cost of professional services consists primarily of personnel costs and third party fees associated with implementation  integration and education services that we provide to our customers  and the related infrastructure to support this business 
cost of professional services decreased from fiscal to and increased from fiscal to fiscal excluding the impact of remedy and magic expenses subsequent to their acquisition dates  cost of professional services declined from fiscal to fiscal excluding the impact of remedy and magic expenses and costs related to exit activities  cost of professional services declined from fiscal to fiscal this decrease resulted primarily from lower headcount throughout fiscal excluding the costs related to exit activities in fiscal  the cost of professional services increased from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to increased professional services revenues and increased utilization of third party implementation services 
selling and marketing our selling and marketing expenses primarily include personnel and related costs  sales commissions and costs associated with advertising  industry trade shows and sales seminars  and represented  and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
selling and marketing expenses increased from fiscal to fiscal and decreased from fiscal to fiscal excluding the impact of remedy and magic expenses subsequent to their acquisition dates  selling and marketing expenses increased in fiscal excluding the impact of remedy and magic expenses and costs related to exit activities  selling and marketing expenses decreased from fiscal to fiscal this decline was primarily related to decreases in personnel and travel expenses as a result of the headcount reductions early in the year as discussed above  which were slightly offset by an increase in commissions  sales seminars and advertising expenses 
the increase in commission expense in fiscal occurred late in the fiscal year when the actual mix of the license and maintenance components of our largest sales transactions differed from the historical 
table of contents norm  upon which the fiscal commission plan was established 
because of this shift in the license and maintenance mix  the commission rate effectively increased during this time period 
selling and marketing expenses declined in fiscal primarily as a result of the costs related to exit activities in the prior year and decreased commissions expense partially offset by increased headcount and travel costs  including acquisitions 
commission expense is down as a result of changes in our commission plan that led to increased commissions on maintenance bookings which are initially deferred and then are expensed as the related revenues are recognized 
for fiscal  and  commission expense was impacted by the changes in our deferred commissions balance ie  the net impact of commissions deferred and commissions recognized out of the deferred balance as follows years ended march  in millions net impact of change in deferred commissions on selling and marketing expenses total deferred commissions balance research and development research and development expenses mainly comprise personnel costs related to software developers and development support personnel  including software programmers  testing and quality assurance personnel and writers of technical documentation such as product manuals and installation guides 
these expenses also include computer hardware software costs  telecommunications and personnel expenses necessary to maintain our research and development data processing center 
research and development expenses increased from fiscal to fiscal and decreased from fiscal to fiscal excluding the impact of costs related to exit activities in fiscal  research and development expenses increased from fiscal to fiscal  primarily because fiscal included a full year of remedy costs  while fiscal included only the expenses for the four months after the acquisition date 
this was partially offset by decreased personnel costs for the rest of bmc software as a result of the headcount reductions early in the year as discussed above 
research and development expenses declined in fiscal primarily as a result of the costs related to exit activities in the prior year 
excluding the exit costs in fiscal  research and development costs decreased 
while we had personnel growth in lower cost locations and from acquisitions  research and development expenses declined because more software development costs required capitalization  as discussed under cost of license revenues above 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of compensation and personnel costs within executive management  finance and accounting  it  facilities management  legal and human resources 
other costs included in general and administrative expenses are fees paid for outside legal and accounting services  consulting projects and insurance 
general and administrative expenses increased from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal excluding the impact of remedy and magic expenses subsequent to their acquisition dates  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal excluding the impact of remedy and magic expenses and costs related to exit activities  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal the increase included higher consulting fees  primarily related to sarbanes oxley compliance and an ongoing infrastructure software implementation  higher legal and professional fees and an increase in bad debt expense related to maintenance billings 
excluding the exit costs in fiscal  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal this increase included higher professional fees  consisting of legal  accounting and consulting fees primarily due to sarbanes oxley section compliance efforts  and higher personnel costs  a significant portion of which related to expanded accounting staff 
total third party fees incurred in fiscal related to sarbanes oxley section compliance were million  and we will continue to incur such fees at a lower level in fiscal the increase for fiscal also included the write off of million of costs capitalized for an internal use 
table of contents information technology project that was terminated before completion during the year and other internal use software assets 
amortization of intangible assets under the purchase method of accounting for our business combinations  portions of the purchase prices were allocated to intangible assets  including customer relationships  tradenames and non compete agreements 
we are amortizing certain of these intangible assets over two to four year periods  which reflect the estimated useful lives of the respective assets 
the increases in amortization expense in fiscal and were primarily due to the acquisitions during those years 
acquired research and development during fiscal  and  we wrote off acquired in process research and development ipr d totaling million in connection with the acquisition of remedy of the purchase price  million in connection with the acquisition of magic of the purchase price and million in connection with the acquisitions of viadyne  calendra and opennetwork collectively  of the aggregate purchase price  respectively 
the amounts allocated to ipr d represent the estimated fair values  based on risk adjusted cash flows and historical costs expended  related to incomplete research and development projects 
at the dates of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the acquisition dates  during fiscal  and in making the purchase price allocations to ipr d  we considered present value calculations of income  analyses of project accomplishments and remaining outstanding items  assessments of overall contributions  as well as project risks 
the values assigned to purchased in process technology were determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects  and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue projections used to value the in process research and development were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology  and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors 
the resulting net cash flows from such projects are based on our estimates of cost of sales  operating expenses and income taxes from such projects 
a risk adjusted discount rate was applied to the cash flows of each of the products projected income streams for the five years following the acquisition 
these discount rates assume that the risk of revenue streams for new technology is higher than that of existing revenue streams 
the discount rates used in the present value calculations were generally derived from a weighted average cost of capital  adjusted upward to reflect the additional risks inherent in the development life cycle  including the useful life of the technology  profitability levels of the technology and the uncertainty of technology advances that are known at the transaction date 
product specific risk includes the stages of completion of each product  the complexity of the development work completed to date  the likelihood of achieving technological feasibility and market acceptance 
in the present value calculation for remedy  aggregate revenues for developed  in process and future products were estimated to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of approximately for the five years following acquisition  assuming the successful completion and market acceptance of the major current and future research and development programs 
the estimated revenues for the in process projects were expected to peak within three years of acquisition and then decline sharply as other new products and technologies are expected to enter the market 
the estimates used in valuing ipr d were based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
accordingly  actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value 

table of contents impairment of goodwill we test our goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  after the annual planning process is complete 
primarily due to recent operating results  including the increased use of third party implementation services  the projected profitability and cash flows of the professional services segment were reduced 
as a result  the goodwill of million assigned to the professional services segment was considered totally impaired during fiscal the fair value of the professional services reporting unit was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method of applying the income approach 
settlement of litigation we settled our dispute with nastel technologies  inc during fiscal the settlement payment of million covers all claims involved in this action 
fiscal exit activities while we remained focused on expense control throughout fiscal  we implemented a plan subsequent to march  that we expect will allow us to meet our profitability goals by reducing costs and realigning resources to focus on growth areas 
the fiscal plan includes the elimination of to employee positions around the world 
we have reduced investment in product areas that are not at acceptable profitability levels and have reduced selling  general and administrative expenses throughout our organization 
we expect that the actions taken will allow us to increase investment in our service management business  which we believe will provide us future revenue growth  maintain our strong profitability in our mainframe management business and improve our profitability in our distributed systems management business 
combining the expected annual cost savings from these actions and the increased investment in growth areas  we estimate that we will achieve an annual expense reduction of approximately million relative to our projected operating expenses before our restructuring activities 
other income  net other income  net  consists primarily of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and finance receivables  rental income on owned facilities  gains and losses on marketable securities and other investments and interest expense on capital leases 
other income  net  increased from fiscal to fiscal and increased from fiscal to fiscal the increase in fiscal is primarily due to the million gain on the licensing of our patrol storage manager product to emc corporation during the year  increased investment income  including the realized recovery of marketable securities previously written down  and an increase in rental income  which were slightly offset by million of impairment charges related to cost basis investments 
the increase in other income  net for fiscal is primarily due to an million gain realized on the sale of previously securitized finance receivables as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and impairment charges 
these increases were partially offset by net losses of million on marketable securities in fiscal and a decrease as a result of the non recurring gain on patrol storage manager in the prior year  as discussed above 
income tax provision benefit we recorded an income tax expense of million in fiscal  an income tax benefit of million in fiscal and an income tax expense of million in fiscal our effective tax rates were  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate is impacted primarily by the tax effect attributable to our foreign earnings net of us tax consequences  changes in the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets  benefits attributable to the extraterritorial income exclusion and non recurring adjustments to our aggregate net liabilities for income taxes 
in fiscal  the most significant item impacting our effective tax rate is a tax benefit of million recorded as a result of the reversal of a valuation allowance that was previously recorded against our deferred tax assets  as discussed below 
the other significant item impacting our fiscal effective tax rate is an expense of million to adjust our aggregate net liabilities for income taxes  withholding taxes and income tax exposures that were found to be 
table of contents understated after a thorough analysis of all of our income tax accounts in the first quarter of fiscal for a detailed analysis of the differences between the statutory and effective income tax rates  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in evaluating our ability to realize our net deferred tax asset  we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years  tax planning strategies and our forecast of future taxable income 
in considering these sources of taxable income  we must make certain assumptions and judgments that are based on the plans and estimates we use to manage our underlying business 
changes in our assumptions and estimates may materially impact our income tax expense 
during fiscal  we evaluated all available positive and negative evidence and concluded that a valuation allowance was no longer necessary  except for the specific items totaling million discussed below 
the following evidence influenced the change in our assessment from fiscal to fiscal we generated positive earnings before taxes in fiscal and are no longer in a cumulative loss position when aggregating the fiscal  and consolidated results of operations 
in fiscal  we generated losses before taxes and were in a cumulative loss position 
in addition  we can support a large portion of our net deferred tax asset through the evaluation of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets 
our tax planning strategies primarily involve the acceleration of royalty and cost sharing payments under agreements that are currently in place between bmc software and its foreign affiliates 
under these agreements  the acceleration of such payments is at our sole discretion 
each year we must evaluate the amount of domestic deferred tax assets that could be supported by the acceleration of these taxable income streams 
based on the assumptions and estimates that were determined in conjunction with the preparation of our fiscal operating results  we believe that these tax planning strategies support more deferred tax assets than they supported at the end of fiscal in our evaluation we also considered negative evidence such as our inability to carryback losses to earlier tax years 
after a thorough evaluation of both the positive and negative evidence  we concluded that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary beyond the items discussed below and that our net deferred tax asset as of march  is supportable 
consistent with this judgment  we recorded a million tax benefit as part of the total income tax expense for fiscal  for the reversal of the valuation allowance previously recorded against our deferred tax assets 
we also reduced our valuation allowance and recorded an increase to additional paid in capital of million for tax benefits attributable to non qualified stock option exercises in prior years that resided in the net operating loss carryforwards that were utilized in fiscal sfas no 
also requires the evaluation of the character of income that generated our deferred tax assets 
our deferred tax assets include losses that are attributable to capital transactions that require future taxable income of a specific character in order to utilize 
we have maintained a valuation allowance against this specific asset as we do not have positive evidence that supports the utilization of the capital loss 
we have also maintained a valuation allowance against a research and development credit acquired as part of the marimba acquisition due to various uncertainties regarding the utilization of this specific asset 
we increased our valuation allowance and recorded an increase to goodwill of million related to this acquired asset 
if this valuation allowance is reduced in a future year  a related reduction to goodwill would be recognized 
the combined valuation allowance attributable to these two specific items is million 
we will continue to evaluate the realizability of our net deferred tax asset on a quarterly basis 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our deferred tax assets 
we provide for the us income tax effect on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered indefinitely re invested outside of the united states 
at march   we recorded a deferred tax asset of million related to excess foreign tax credits that are available to offset our us income taxes on the earnings we do not consider indefinitely re invested under apb opinion no 
as of march   the cumulative earnings upon which us income taxes have not been provided were approximately million 
if these earnings were repatriated to the united states  or they were no longer determined to indefinitely re invested under apb opinion no 
 the potential deferred tax liability for these earnings would be approximately million without the special one time tax deduction discussed below  assuming full utilization of the foreign tax credits associated with these earnings 

table of contents on october   president bush signed the american jobs creation act of the act  which provides for a special one time tax deduction of of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated 
as of march   we had not decided on whether  and to what extent  we might repatriate foreign earnings under the act  and accordingly  the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not reflect any provision for taxes on unremitted foreign earnings available for repatriation under the act 
since that time  however  the us treasury department issued additional guidance interpreting the act and we have completed our analysis of the act 
in june  our board of directors approved a plan to repatriate approximately million of foreign earnings and  accordingly  we will record a tax liability and associated tax expense of approximately million related to the planned repatriation during the quarter ending june  as of march   we have foreign tax credit carryforwards of million that will expire between and and research and development tax credit carryforwards of million net of a million valuation allowance that will expire in we also have alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of million that are not subject to expiration 
during fiscal  we and the internal revenue service appeals division irs appeals resolved our income tax audits for the fiscal years ended march  and accordingly  we have now closed all federal corporate income tax audit issues for years prior to fiscal the settlement with irs appeals did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
the irs has completed its examination of our federal income tax returns filed for the tax years ended march  and and issued its revenue agent report 
we have filed our protest letter and are currently working with irs appeals to resolve the issues raised at examination 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the proposed adjustments  that adequate provisions for income taxes have been made and  therefore  that the ultimate resolution of the issues will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
during the quarter ended september   the irs commenced the examination of our fiscal and federal income tax returns 
we believe that our income tax provisions adequately reflect the proper amount of income tax associated with these arrangements 
quarterly results the following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly financial data for fiscal and this information has been prepared on the same basis as the accompanying consolidated financial statements and all necessary adjustments have been included in the amounts below to present fairly the selected quarterly information when read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto

eitf issue no 
provides guidance on evaluating other than temporary impairment for marketable debt and equity securities accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  as well as non marketable equity securities accounted for under the cost method 
the consensus includes a basic three step model to evaluate whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
eitf issue  effective date of paragraphs of eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
this fsp delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in eitf issue no 
until the fasb staff provides applicable implementation guidance 
this delay does not suspend the requirement to recognize other than temporary impairments as required by existing authoritative literature 
during the period of delay  an entity holding investments must continue to apply relevant other than temporary guidance 
we do not expect the new guidance to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  as an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
this statement addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets 
it eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in apb opinion no 
and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
this statement specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the provisions of this statement are effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  and must be applied prospectively 
we do not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
in april  the sec issued a rule delaying the required adoption date for sfas no 
r to the first interim period of the first fiscal year beginning on or after june  generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r permits adoption using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning on the effective date based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and based on sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that remain unvested on the effective date or a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method  but also permits entities to restate all periods presented or prior interim periods of the year of adoption based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures 
we expect to adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method as of april   the beginning of our fiscal we are currently evaluating option valuation methodologies and assumptions in light of fas r and the sec guidance  the methodologies and assumptions we ultimately use to adopt fas r may be different than those currently used as discussed in note l to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options  as the exercise prices of options granted are generally equal to the quoted market price of our common stock on the date of grant  except in limited circumstances when stock options have been exchanged in a business combination 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 

table of contents however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings loss and earnings loss per share in note l to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
in general  this requirement would reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the excess tax deductions recorded in fiscal were million 
we did not recognize any such tax benefits for fiscal and in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
this statement changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
it applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and to those changes required by an accounting pronouncement when such a pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
liquidity and capital resources one of our major goals is to optimize our capital structure 
the key metrics we focus on in analyzing the strength of our financial position are summarized in the tables below years ended march  in millions cash provided by operating activities treasury stock acquired cash paid for technology acquisitions and other investments  net of cash acquired as of march  in millions cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities trade accounts receivable  net including current finance receivables long term trade finance receivables  net deferred revenue 
table of contents operating activities the table below aggregates certain line items from the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows to present the key items affecting our cash flows from operating activities years ended march  in millions net earnings loss adjustments to net earnings loss for items whose cash effects are investing or financing cash flows decrease in accounts receivable and finance receivables increase in current and long term deferred revenue decrease in income taxes receivable changes in all other operating assets and liabilities  net net cash provided by operating activities the most significant component of adjustments to net earnings loss for items whose cash effects are investing or financing cash flows is depreciation and amortization  as follows years ended march  in millions depreciation amortization of capitalized software development costs amortization of acquired technology and intangible assets amortization of premiums on marketable debt securities depreciation and amortization in fiscal  we received a tax refund of over million 
in fiscal  we paid cash exit costs of million  net of sublease income received  primarily related to exited leases as discussed under fiscal exit activities and related costs above  and paid a litigation settlement of million to nastel  as discussed under settlement of litigation above 
we continue to finance our operations primarily through funds generated from operations 
our primary source of cash is the sale of our software licenses  software maintenance and professional services 
we believe that our existing cash balances and funds to be generated from operating and investing activities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we have a history of acquiring companies 
if we were to make a significant acquisition in the future  we might find it advantageous to utilize third party financing sources based on factors such as our then available cash and its source cash held in the united states versus international locations  the cost of financing and our internal cost of capital 

table of contents investing activities the table below aggregates certain line items from the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows to present the key items affecting our cash flows from investing activities years ended march  in millions cash paid for technology acquisitions and other investments  net of cash acquired proceeds from maturities sales of marketable securities purchases of marketable securities capitalization of software development costs all other  net net cash used in investing activities during fiscal  we acquired remedy and it masters 
in fiscal  we acquired magic and made contractual adjustments to the purchase prices for the fiscal acquisitions 
in fiscal  we acquired marimba  calendra  opennetwork and other less significant businesses 
our acquisitions are discussed in more detail under acquisitions above and in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the main component of other cash used in investing activities was purchases of property and equipment  which were primarily purchases of computer hardware and software in all years  as well as for leasehold improvements in fiscal as a result of office relocations during that year 
cash receipts from previously securitized finance receivables totaled million in fiscal  as discussed under finance receivables below and in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
financing activities the table below aggregates certain line items from the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows to present the key items affecting our cash flows from financing activities years ended march  in millions payments on capital leases treasury stock acquired all other  net net cash used in financing activities there were no borrowings during fiscal  and and the main use of cash for financing activities was the acquisition of treasury stock in all years 
during fiscal  approximately million shares of treasury stock were purchased 
we plan to increase our treasury stock purchases  subject to market conditions  other possible uses of our cash and our domestic liquidity position 
see market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 
the exercise of stock options was the primary source of cash from financing activities 
capital lease obligations of million and million were incurred during fiscal and  respectively  for computer hardware 

table of contents cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at march   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were billion  an increase of million from the march  balance 
as discussed in more detail below  this increase is primarily due to positive operating cash flow  which was somewhat offset by the cash funding for the marimba  calendra and other acquisitions and treasury stock purchases 
approximately of our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at march  is held in international locations and was largely generated from our international operations 
our international operations have generated approximately million of earnings for which us income taxes have not been recorded 
these earnings would be subject to us income tax if repatriated to the united states 
the potential deferred tax liability for these earnings is approximately million without the special one time tax deduction discussed below  however  we have not provided a deferred tax liability on any portion of the million as these earnings were considered permanently invested outside of the us during fiscal  and  we utilized cash held in international locations to fund a portion of the remedy purchase price  based upon the valuation of the foreign assets of remedy acquired  and the it masters  magic and calendra purchase prices 
on october   president bush signed the american jobs creation act of the act  which provides for a special one time tax deduction of of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated 
as of march   we had not decided on whether  and to what extent  we might repatriate foreign earnings under the act  and accordingly  the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not reflect any provision for taxes on unremitted foreign earnings available for repatriation under the act 
since that time  however  the us treasury department issued additional guidance interpreting the act and we have completed our analysis of the act 
in june  our board of directors approved a plan to repatriate approximately million of foreign earnings and  accordingly  we will record a tax liability and associated tax expense of approximately million related to the planned repatriation during the quarter ending june  our marketable securities are primarily investment grade and highly liquid 
a significant dollar portion of our marketable securities is invested in securities with maturities beyond one year  and while typically yielding greater returns  investing in such securities reduces reported working capital 
finance receivables we provide financing on a portion of our sales transactions to customers that meet our specified standards of creditworthiness 
our practice of providing financing at reasonable interest rates enhances our competitive position 
we participate in established programs with third party financial institutions to sell a significant portion of our finance receivables  enabling us to collect cash sooner and remove credit risk 
the finance receivables are sold to third party financial institutions on a non recourse basis 
we record such transfers of beneficial interests in finance receivables to third party financial institutions as sales of such finance receivables when we have surrendered control of such receivables  including determining that such assets have been isolated beyond our reach and the reach of our creditors 
we have not guaranteed the transferred receivables and have no obligation upon default 
during fiscal  and  we transferred million  million and million  respectively  of such receivables through these programs 
the high credit quality of our finance receivables and the existence of these third party facilities extend our ability to offer financing to qualifying customers on an ongoing basis 
however  to meet the needs of our customers we have been providing more licensing options  and this increased focus on flexibility may lead to more customer transactions where cash payments will be received over time 
this flexibility may also reduce our ability to transfer finance receivables in the future and may reduce our cash flow from operations in the near term 
as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  prior to fiscal  we securitized trade finance receivables from customers with investment grade credit ratings through two commercial paper conduit entities sponsored by third party financial institutions 
in april  one of these third party entities sold its interests in our outstanding securitized finance receivables to the other third party entity  such that the senior interests in all of our outstanding securitized finance receivables were held by one 
table of contents entity 
in december  we purchased the senior interests from this entity at fair value  effectively terminating our securitization arrangements 
we simultaneously transferred the outstanding finance receivables that had previously been securitized to an unaffiliated financial institution on a non recourse basis through our existing financial subsidiary 
this transfer was recorded as a sale in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
treasury stock purchased our board of directors has authorized a billion stock repurchase program million authorized in april that was increased by million in july 
during fiscal  we purchased million shares for million 
from the inception of the repurchase plan through march   we have purchased million shares for million 
see market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 
the repurchase program is funded solely with domestic cash and  therefore  affects our overall domestic versus international liquidity balances 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of march  payments due by period less than after year years years years total capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet total contractual obligations represents obligations under agreements with non cancelable terms to purchases goods or services 
the agreements are enforceable and legally binding  and specify specific terms  including quantities to be purchased and the timing of the purchase 
total does not include contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities  other than capital lease obligations 
certain risks and uncertainties we operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
the following section describes some  but not all  of the risks and uncertainties that we believe may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we may announce lower than expected revenues  license bookings or earnings  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our revenues  license bookings and earnings are difficult to forecast and are likely to fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to many factors 
in addition  a significant amount of our license transactions are completed during the final weeks and days of the quarter  and therefore we generally do not know whether revenues  license bookings and or earnings will have met expectations until shortly after the end of the quarter 
any significant shortfall in revenues  license bookings or earnings or lowered expectations could cause 
table of contents our stock price to decline substantially 
factors that could affect our financial results include  but are not limited to the unpredictability of the timing and magnitude of our sales through direct sales channels  value added resellers and distributors  which tend to occur late in each quarter  the possibility that our customers may choose to license our software under terms and conditions that require revenues to be deferred or recognized ratably over time rather than upfront and that we may not accurately forecast the resulting mix of license transactions between upfront and deferred revenues  the possibility that the negotiated terms and conditions of transactions may result in a different mix of license and maintenance revenues on an aggregate basis than is expected based on historical results and financial planning  the possibility that our customers may defer or limit purchases as a result of reduced information technology budgets or reduced data processing capacity demand  the possibility that our customers may delay or limit purchases as a result of increased requirements related to the documentation of and focus on internal controls and mitigation of risks  related to sarbanes oxley compliance efforts  the possibility that our customers may elect not to license our products for additional processing capacity until their actual processing capacity or expected future processing capacity exceeds the capacity they have already licensed from us  the possibility that our customers may defer purchases of our products in anticipation of new products or product updates from us or our competitors  the timing of new product introductions by us and the market s acceptance of new products  higher than expected operating expenses  changes in our pricing and distribution terms and or those of our competitors  and the possibility that our business will be adversely affected as a result of the threat of significant external events that increase global economic uncertainty 
investors should not rely on the results of prior periods as an indication of our future performance 
our operating expense levels are based  in significant part  on our expectations of future revenue 
if we have a shortfall in revenue in any given quarter  we will not be able to reduce our operating expenses for that quarter proportionally in response 
therefore  any significant shortfall in revenue will likely have an immediate adverse effect on our operating results for that quarter 
we may have difficulty achieving our cash flow from operations goals 
our quarterly cash flow is and has been volatile 
if our cash generated from operations in some future period is materially less than the market expects  our stock price could decline 
to meet the needs of our customers  we have been providing more licensing options  and this increased focus on flexibility may lead to more contracts where revenues will be recognized ratably versus upfront and where cash payments may be received over time versus upfront 
factors that could adversely affect our cash flow from operations in the future include reduced net earnings  increased time required for the collection of accounts receivable  an increase in uncollectible accounts receivable  a significant shift from multi year committed contracts to short term contracts  a reduced ability to transfer finance receivables to third parties and thus increased credit risk assumed by us  an increase in contracts where expenses such as sales commissions are paid upfront but payments from customers are collected over time  reduced renewal rates for maintenance  and a reduced yield from marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents 

table of contents maintenance revenue could decline 
maintenance revenues have increased in each of the last three fiscal years as a result of acquisitions and the continuing growth in the base of installed products and the processing capacity on which they run 
maintenance fees increase as the processing capacity on which the products are installed increases  consequently  we receive higher absolute maintenance fees with new license and maintenance agreements and as existing customers install our products on additional processing capacity 
due to increased discounting for higher levels of additional processing capacity  the maintenance fees on a per unit of capacity basis are typically reduced in enterprise license agreements 
in addition  customers are generally entitled to reduced annual maintenance percentages for entering into long term maintenance contracts 
these discounts  combined with an increase in long term maintenance contracts with reduced maintenance percentages and our license bookings performance  have led to lower year over year growth rates for our maintenance revenues excluding acquisitions 
declines in our license bookings  increases in long term maintenance contracts and or increased discounting would lead to declines in our maintenance revenues 
should customers migrate from their mainframe applications or find alternatives to our products  increased cancellations could lead to declines in our maintenance revenues 
our restructuring may not achieve our desired results and  if unsuccessful  could adversely affect our business 
in april  we implemented a restructuring plan involving significant reductions in our workforce 
although we made efforts to minimize the impact on quota carrying sales representatives  the workforce reductions included employees in our sales department  which could affect our ability to close future revenue transactions with our customers and prospects 
the failure to retain and effectively manage our remaining employees could lead to decreased morale and attrition which could increase our costs  hinder our development efforts  impact the quality of our products  delay the delivery of new products or product updates and adversely affect our customer service 
if we are unable to achieve the desired results of our restructuring plan  we could fall short of our profitability goals and could have to engage in additional restructuring activity 
further  we believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel 
we could have difficulty attracting and retaining such personnel as a result of a perceived risk of future workforce reductions 
the software industry includes large  powerful multi line and small  agile single line competitors 
some of our largest competitors  including ibm  computer associates and hp  have significant scale advantages 
with scale comes a large installed base of customers in particular market niches  as well as the ability to develop and market software competitive with ours 
some of these competitors can also bundle hardware  software  and services together  which is a disadvantage for us since we do not provide hardware and have far fewer services offerings 
competitive products are also offered by numerous independent software companies that specialize in specific aspects of the highly fragmented software industry 
some  like microsoft  oracle  and sap  are the leading developers and vendors in their specialized markets 
in addition  new companies enter the market on a frequent and regular basis  offering products that compete with those offered by us 
as the software industry consolidates generally  it is possible that storage and security vendors such as emc and symantec will enter the systems management market 
additionally  many customers historically have developed their own products that compete with those offered by us 
competition from any of these sources can result in price reductions or displacement of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
industry consolidation could affect prices or demand for our products 
the it industry and the market for our systems management products is becoming increasingly competitive due to a variety of factors including a maturing enterprise infrastructure software market  changes in customer it spending habits  and mixed economic recovery in the us there is also a growing trend toward consolidation in the software industry 
continued consolidation within the software industry could create opportunities for larger software companies  such as ibm  microsoft and oracle  to increase their market 
table of contents share through the acquisition of companies that dominate certain lucrative market niches or that have loyal installed customer bases 
we expect this trend towards consolidation to continue as companies attempt to maintain or extend their market and competitive positions in the rapidly changing software industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations 
this industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole source vendors for customers 
this could lead to more variability in our operating results due to lengthening of the customer evaluation process and or loss of business to these stronger competitors  which may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our products must remain compatible with ever changing operating and database environments 
ibm  hp  microsoft and oracle are by far the largest suppliers of systems and database software and  in many cases  are the manufacturers of the computer hardware systems used by most of our customers 
historically  operating and database system developers have modified or introduced new operating systems  database systems  systems software and computer hardware 
such new products could incorporate features which perform functions currently performed by our products or could require substantial modification of our products to maintain compatibility with these companies hardware or software 
we have generally been able to adapt our products and our business to changes introduced by hardware manufacturers and operating and database system software developers  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future 
failure to adapt our products in a timely manner to such changes or customer decisions to forego the use of our products in favor of those with comparable functionality contained either in the hardware or operating system could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
future product development is dependent upon access to third party source code 
in the past  licensees using proprietary operating systems were furnished with source code  which makes the operating system generally understandable to programmers  and object code  which directly controls the hardware and other technical documentation 
since the availability of source code facilitated the development of systems and applications software  which must interface with the operating systems  independent software vendors such as bmc software were able to develop and market compatible software 
ibm and other hardware vendors have a policy of restricting the use or availability of the source code for some of their operating systems 
to date  this policy has not had a material effect on us 
some companies  however  may adopt more restrictive policies in the future or impose unfavorable terms and conditions for such access 
these restrictions may  in the future  result in higher research and development costs for us in connection with the enhancement and modification of our existing products and the development of new products 
although we do not expect that such restrictions will have this adverse effect  there can be no assurances that such restrictions or other restrictions will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
future product development is dependent upon early access to third party operating and database systems 
operating and database system software developers have in the past provided us with early access to pre generally available ga versions of their software in order to have input into the functionality and to ensure that we can adapt our software to exploit new functionality in these systems 
some companies  however  may adopt more restrictive policies in the future or impose unfavorable terms and conditions for such access 
these restrictions may result in higher research and development costs for us in connection with the enhancement and modification of our existing products and the development of new products 
although we do not expect that such restrictions will have this adverse effect  there can be no assurances that such restrictions or other restrictions will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
future product development is dependent on access to and reliability of third party software products 
certain of our software products contain components developed and maintained by third party software vendors 
we expect that we may have to incorporate software from third party vendors in our future products 

table of contents we may not be able to replace the functionality provided by the third party software currently offered with our products if that software becomes obsolete  defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or is not adequately maintained or updated or if our relationship with the third party vendor terminates 
although we believe there are adequate alternate sources for the technology licensed to us  any significant interruption in the availability of these third party software products on commercially acceptable terms or defects in these products could delay development of future products or enhancement of future products and harm our revenues 
growing market acceptance of open source software could cause a decline in our revenues and operating margins 
growing market acceptance of open source software has presented both benefits and challenges to the commercial software industry in recent years 
open source software is made widely available by its authors and is licensed as is for a nominal fee or  in some cases  at no charge 
we have incorporated some open source software into our products  allowing us to enhance certain solutions without incurring substantial additional research and development costs 
thus far  we have encountered no unanticipated material problems arising from our use of open source software 
however  as the use of open source software becomes more widespread  certain open source technology could become competitive with our proprietary technology  which could cause sales of our products to decline or force us to reduce the fees we charge for our products  which could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and operating margins 
failure to adapt to technological change could adversely affect our revenues 
if we fail to keep pace with technological change in our industry  such failure would have an adverse effect on our revenues 
we operate in a highly competitive industry characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
during the past several years  many new technological advancements and competing products entered the marketplace 
the distributed systems and application management markets in which we operate are far more crowded and competitive than our traditional mainframe systems management markets 
our ability to compete effectively and our growth prospects depend upon many factors  including the success of our existing distributed systems products  the timely introduction and success of future software products  the ability of our products to interoperate and perform well with existing and future leading databases and other platforms supported by our products and our ability to bring products to market that meet ever changing customer requirements 
to the extent that our current product portfolio does not meet such changing requirements  our revenues will suffer 
we have experienced long development cycles and product delays in the past  particularly with some of our distributed systems products  and expect to have delays in the future 
delays in new product introductions or less than anticipated market acceptance of these new products are possible and would have an adverse effect on our revenues 
discovery of errors in our software could adversely affect our earnings 
the software products we offer are inherently complex 
despite testing and quality control  we cannot be certain that errors will not be found in current versions  new versions or enhancements of our products after commencement of commercial shipments 
if new or existing customers have difficulty deploying our products or require significant amounts of customer support  our operating margins could be harmed 
moreover  we could face possible claims and higher development costs if our software contains undetected errors or if we fail to meet our customers expectations 
with our bsm strategy  these risks increase because we are combining already complex products to create solutions that are even more complicated than the aggregation of their product components 
significant technical challenges also arise with our products because our customers purchase and deploy our products across a variety of computer platforms and integrate them with a number of third party software applications and databases 
these combinations increase our risk further because in the 
table of contents event of a system wide failure  it may be difficult to determine which product is at fault  thus  we may be harmed by the failure of another supplier s products 
as a result of the foregoing  we could experience loss of or delay in revenues and loss of market share  loss of customers  damage to our reputation  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  increased service and warranty costs  legal actions by customers against us which could  whether or not successful  increase costs and distract our management  and increased insurance costs 
failure to maintain our existing distribution channels and develop additional channels in the future could adversely affect our revenues 
the percentage of our revenues from sales of our products and services through distribution channels such as systems integrators and value added resellers is increasing 
conducting business through indirect distribution channels presents a number of risks  including each of our systems integrators and value added resellers can cease marketing our products and services with limited or no notice and with little or no penalty  we may not be able to replace existing or recruit additional systems integrators or value added resellers if we lose any of our existing ones  our existing systems integrators and value added resellers may not be able to effectively sell new products and services that we may introduce  we do not have direct control over the business practices adopted by our systems integrators and value added resellers  our systems integrators and value added resellers may also offer competitive products and services and as such  may not give priority to the marketing of our products and services as compared to our competitors products  and we may face conflicts between the activities of our indirect channels and our direct sales and marketing activities 
our customers may not accept our product strategies 
historically  we have focused on selling software products to address specific customer problems associated with their applications 
our bsm strategy requires us to integrate multiple software products so that they work together to provide comprehensive systems management solutions 
there can be no assurance that customers will perceive a need for such solutions 
in addition  there may be technical difficulties in integrating individual products into a combined solution that may delay the introduction of such solutions to the market or adversely affect the demand for such solutions 
we may also adopt different sales strategies for marketing our products  and there can be no assurance that our strategies for selling solutions will be successful 
changes to compensation of our sales organization may have unintended effects 
we update our compensation plans for the sales organization periodically 
as in most years  we have made significant changes for fiscal these plans are intended to align with our business objectives of 
table of contents providing customer flexibility and satisfaction 
the compensation plans may encourage behavior not anticipated or intended as it is implemented  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results and or cash flows 
changes to our sales compensation plan could also make it difficult for us to attract and retain top sales talent 
risks related to business combinations 
as part of our overall strategy  we have acquired or invested in  and plan to continue to acquire or invest in  complementary companies  products  and technologies and to enter into joint ventures and strategic alliances with other companies 
risks commonly encountered in such transactions include the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the combined companies  the risk that we may not be able to integrate the acquired technologies or products with our current products and technologies  the potential disruption of our ongoing business  the inability to retain key technical  sales and managerial personnel  the inability of management to maximize our financial and strategic position through the successful integration of acquired businesses  the risk that revenues from acquired companies  products and technologies do not meet our expectations  and decreases in reported earnings as a result of charges for in process research and development and amortization of acquired intangible assets 
for us to maximize the return on our investments in acquired companies  the products of these entities must be integrated with our existing products 
these integrations can be difficult and unpredictable  especially given the complexity of software and that acquired technology is typically developed independently and designed with no regard to integration 
the difficulties are compounded when the products involved are well established because compatibility with the existing base of installed products must be preserved 
successful integration also requires coordination of different development and engineering teams 
this too can be difficult and unpredictable because of possible cultural conflicts and different opinions on technical decisions and product roadmaps 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our product integration efforts or that we will realize the expected benefits 
with each of our acquisitions  we have initiated efforts to integrate the disparate cultures  employees  systems and products of these companies 
retention of key employees is critical to ensure the continued development  support  sales and marketing efforts pertaining to the acquired products 
we have implemented retention programs to keep many of the key technical  sales and marketing employees of acquired companies  nonetheless  we have lost some key employees and may lose others in the future 
unanticipated changes in our effective tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 
we carry out our business operations through entities in the us and multiple foreign jurisdictions 
as such  we are required to file corporate income tax returns that are subject to us  state and foreign tax laws 
the us  state and foreign tax liabilities are determined  in part  by the amount of operating profit generated in these different taxing jurisdictions 
our effective tax rate and earnings could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of operating profits generated in countries with higher statutory tax rates 
we are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
this evaluation requires that our management assess the positive and negative evidence regarding sources of future taxable income 
if management s assessment regarding the realizability of our deferred tax assets changes or we are presented with additional negative evidence regarding future sources of taxable income  we will be required to increase our valuation allowance  which will negatively impact our effective tax rate and earnings 
we are also subject to routine corporate income tax audits in multiple jurisdictions 
our provision for income taxes includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that may result from the examination of our corporate tax returns that have been filed in these jurisdictions 
the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these examinations could be materially different from the amounts included in the provision for income taxes and result in additional tax expense 

table of contents enforcement of our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual procedures to protect our intellectual property rights 
despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of our products or to reverse engineer or obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary 
there can also be no assurance that our intellectual property rights would survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us 
in addition  the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized third party copying or use  which could adversely affect our competitive position 
possibility of infringement claims 
from time to time  we receive notices from third parties claiming infringement by our products of patent and other intellectual property rights 
we expect that software products will increasingly be subject to such claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows and the functionality of products overlaps 
in addition  we may receive more patent infringement claims as companies increasingly seek to patent their software and business methods and enforce such patents  especially given the increase in software and business method patents issued during the past several years 
regardless of its merit  responding to any such claim could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements  which may not be offered or available on terms acceptable to us 
if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology  our business  financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected 
risks related to global operations 
we are a global company with research and development sites in the united states  israel  belgium  france and india  and sales offices around the world 
as a result  we face risks from operating as a global concern  including  among others difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  possible non compliance with our professional conduct policy and code of ethics due to inconsistent interpretations and or application of corporate standards  longer payment cycles  seasonal reductions in business activity in europe  increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities  adverse tax consequences  changes in currency exchange rates  loss of proprietary information due to piracy  misappropriation or weaker laws regarding intellectual property protection  the need to localize our products  political unrest or terrorism  particularly in areas in which we have facilities  compliance with a wide variety of complex laws and treaties  and licenses  tariffs and other trade barriers 
we maintain a significant presence in india  conducting software development and support and it operations 
to date  the dispute between india and pakistan involving the kashmir region has not adversely affected our operations in india 
should we be unable to conduct operations in india in the future  we believe that our business could be temporarily adversely affected 
as the software and technology labor market in 
table of contents india has developed at a rapid pace  with many multi national companies competing for talent  there is a risk that wage and attrition rates will rise faster than we have anticipated  which could lead to operational issues 
we conduct substantial development and marketing operations in multiple locations in israel and  accordingly  we are directly affected by economic  political and military conditions in israel 
any major hostilities involving israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its present trading partners could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we maintain comprehensive contingency and business continuity plans  and to date  the current conflict in the region and hostilities within israel have not caused disruption of our operations located in israel 
generally  our foreign sales are denominated in our foreign subsidiaries local currencies 
if these currency exchange rates change unexpectedly  we could have significant gains or losses 
the foreign currency to which we currently have the most significant exposure is the euro 
additionally  fluctuations of the exchange rate of foreign currencies against the us dollar can affect our revenue within those markets  all of which may adversely impact our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
currently  we use derivative financial instruments to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
such hedging requires us to estimate when transactions will occur and cash will be collected  and we may not be successful in making these estimates 
if these estimates are inaccurate  particularly during periods of currency volatility  it could have a materially adverse affect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
we have identified material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting  which  if not remedied effectively  could have an adverse effect on our business 
management  through documentation  testing and assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the rules promulgated by the sec under section of the sarbanes oxley act of and item of regulation s k  has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting had material weaknesses as of march  in response to these material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  we are implementing  and may be required to further implement  additional controls and procedures 
in addition  in response to these material weaknesses  we will have to hire additional personnel  possibly requiring significant time and expense 
furthermore  we intend to continue improving our internal control over financial reporting  and the implementation and testing of these continued improvements could result in increased cost and could divert management attention away from operating our business 
in future periods  if the process required by section of the sarbanes oxley act reveals further material weaknesses or significant deficiencies  the correction of any such material weakness or significant deficiency could require additional remedial measures which could be costly and time consuming 
if a material weakness exists as of a future period year end including a material weakness identified prior to year end for which there is an insufficient period of time to evaluate and confirm the effectiveness of the corrections or related new procedures  our management will be unable to report favorably as of such future period year end to the effectiveness of our control over financial reporting 
if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period  or if we continue to experience material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which would have an adverse effect on our stock price and potentially subject us to litigation 
if the carrying value of our long lived assets were not recoverable  recognition of an impairment loss would be required  which would adversely affect our financial results 
we evaluate our long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill  acquired product rights and other intangible assets  whenever events or circumstances occur which indicate that these assets might be impaired 
in addition  the realizability of acquired technology and capitalized software development costs is evaluated quarterly  and goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are evaluated annually for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  regardless of events and circumstances 
the reader should 
table of contents be aware that in the continuing process of evaluating the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long lived assets  there is the possibility that we could identify a substantial impairment  which could adversely affect our financial results 
revised accounting pronouncements related to share based payments will reduce our reported earnings and could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel by reducing the share based payments we are able to provide 
we use stock options and other long term equity incentives as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages 
we believe that stock options and other long term equity incentives directly motivate our employees to maximize long term stockholder value and  through the use of vesting  encourage employees to remain with bmc software 
in accounting for our stock option grants using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of apb opinion no 
 we generally recognize no compensation cost because the exercise price of options granted is generally equal to the market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
the fasb has revised us generally accepted accounting principles such that we will be required to record charges to earnings for employee stock option grants  which will negatively impact our earnings 
the impact cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  if we had recorded charges for employee stock options using the fair value method under sfas no 
 we would have reduced net earnings by million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
in addition  the new york stock exchange rule requiring stockholder approval for all stock option plans could make it more difficult for us to adopt plans to grant options to employees in the future 
to the extent that it becomes more difficult or costly to grant options and or other stock based compensation to employees  we may incur increased cash compensation costs or find it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  either of which could materially adversely affect our business 
interpretations of existing accounting pronouncements could adversely affect our financial results 
on april  and we adopted aicpa sop  software revenue recognition  and sop modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  respectively 
the adoption of these standards did not have a material impact on our financial position or operating results 
based on our reading and interpretation of these sops  we believe that our current sales contract terms and business arrangements have been properly reported 
future interpretations of existing accounting standards or changes in our business practices could result in future changes in our revenue accounting policies that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changes in the market value of our investments 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage these risks including the use of derivative instruments 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we operate globally and the functional currency for most of our non us enterprises is the local currency 
for fiscal  and  approximately  and  respectively  of our total revenues were derived from customers outside of the united states  substantially all of which were billed and collected in foreign currencies 
similarly  substantially all of the expenses of operating our international subsidiaries are incurred in foreign currencies 
as a result  our us dollar earnings and net cash flows from international operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to minimize our risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  we utilize certain derivative financial instruments 
we primarily utilize two types of derivative financial instruments in managing our foreign currency exchange risk forward exchange contracts and purchased option contracts 
forward exchange contracts are used to offset our exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities 
the terms of these forward 
table of contents exchange contracts are generally one month or less and are entered into at the prevailing market rate at the end of each month 
forward exchange contracts and purchased option contracts  with terms generally less than one year  are used to hedge anticipated  but not firmly committed  sales transactions 
principal currencies hedged are the euro and british pound in europe  the japanese yen and australian dollar in the asia pacific region and the israeli shekel 
while we actively manage our foreign currency risks on an ongoing basis  there can be no assurance our foreign currency hedging activities will offset the full impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our consolidated results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
based on our foreign currency exchange instruments outstanding at march   we estimate a one day maximum potential loss on our foreign currency exchange instruments of million based on a value at risk var model utilizing monte carlo simulation 
the comparable estimate based on our foreign currency exchange instruments outstanding at march  was million utilizing the same model 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a confidence level 
the average var for the period was million for fiscal and million for fiscal the var model is a risk estimation tool  and as such  is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred 
interest rate risk investments we adhere to a conservative investment policy  whereby our principle concern is the preservation of liquid funds while maximizing our yield on such assets 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were approximately billion at march   and the marketable securities of million primarily represented different types of investment grade debt securities 
although our portfolio is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and market conditions  no gain or loss on any security would actually be recognized in earnings unless the instrument was sold or the loss in value was deemed to be other than temporary 
based on our consolidated financial position as of march  and our consolidated results of operations and net cash flows for fiscal  we estimate that a near term change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our future consolidated results of operations or cash flows 
we used a var variance covariance model to measure potential market risk on our marketable securities due to interest rate fluctuations 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a confidence level 
the var model is a risk estimation tool  and as such  is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred
