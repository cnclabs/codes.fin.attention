also  we conduct an intensive orientation program to introduce new hires to our core values  and conduct internal communications and training initiatives that define and promote the core values 
our rate of voluntary turnover was for  a decrease from in our objective is to further reduce our voluntary turnover rate for  as a result of our numerous initiatives to enhance the value proposition we offer to our people 
as of december   we had  full time employees  composed of  project personnel  general and administration personnel and sales and marketing personnel 
none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe that we have good relationships with our employees 
selling and marketing the company s marketing team strives to create and sustain clients loyalty to sapient as their preferred business and technology consultants 
to build sapient s brand awareness in markets in which we operate  we conduct marketing initiatives at both the corporate and industry business unit levels in the united states  and at the geographic level in other countries in which we operate 
our dedicated marketing personnel undertake a variety of marketing activities  including developing and implementing our overall marketing strategy  communicating and strengthening sapient s brand and reputation  sponsoring focused multi client events to build relationships and share our thought leadership  cultivating media and industry analyst relations  conducting market research and analysis  sponsoring and participating in targeted conferences  creating marketing assets to assist client development teams and publishing our web site  www

our sales professionals are primarily organized along industry lines  both within our united states business units and our other international offices 
we believe that the industry and geographic focus of our sales professionals enhances their knowledge and expertise in these industries and generates additional client engagements 
we continue to actively build relationships and strategic alliances with other technology companies and packaged technology vendors 
these relationships involve a wide range of joint activities  including working jointly on client engagements  evaluating and recommending each other s technology solutions to customers  and training and transferring knowledge regarding each other s solutions 
we believe that these relationships and strategic alliances will enable us to provide better delivery and value to our existing clients and will attract new clients through referrals and joint engagements 
our written agreements with our clients contain varying terms and conditions  including  in some instances  the right of the client to terminate the agreement with limited advance notice or penalty 
we do not believe it is generally appropriate to characterize these agreements as backlog 
competition the markets for the services we provide are highly competitive 
we believe that we currently compete principally with large systems consulting and implementation firms and clients internal information systems departments 
we also compete regularly with offshore outsourcing companies  and we expect competition from these companies to increase in the future  especially on development  support and maintenance and outsourcing engagements 
we compete to a lesser extent with specialized e business consulting firms  strategy consulting firms and packaged technology vendors 
some of our competitors have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources  and generate greater revenues and have greater name recognition  than we do 
these competitors can often offer a larger and more diversified suite of products and services than we offer 
consequently  these competitors may win client engagements by significantly discounting their services in exchange for a client s promise to purchase other goods and services from the competitor either concurrently or in the future 

table of contents we believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets include ability to solve business problems  expertise and talent with advanced technologies  global scale  expertise in delivering complex projects on a globally distributed basis  quality and speed of delivery  price of solutions  industry knowledge  understanding of user experiences and sophisticated project and program management capability 
we believe that we compete favorably when considering these factors  and that our ability to rapidly deliver business value to our clients on a fixed price basis using our gdd model  and our successful track record in doing so  distinguishes us from our competitors 
intellectual property rights we rely upon a combination of trade secrets  nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements  and copyright and trademark laws to protect our proprietary rights 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  subcontractors  vendors  consultants and clients  and limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
our services involve the development of business and technology solutions for specific client engagements 
ownership of these solutions is the subject of negotiation and is frequently assigned to the client  although we often retain ownership of certain development tools and may be granted a license to use the solutions for certain purposes 
certain of our clients have prohibited us from marketing the solutions developed for them for specified periods of time or to specified third parties  and we anticipate that certain of our clients will demand similar or other restrictions in the future

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview sapient is a leading business consulting and technology services firm that plans  designs  implements and manages information technology to improve business performance for global clients 
sapient was founded in based on a single promise to deliver the right business results on time and on budget 
our fixed price fixed time model  combined with our industry  design  technology and process expertise  provides clients with the highest business value at the lowest total cost of ownership 
we have offices across the united states and in canada  the united kingdom  germany and india 
throughout we experienced an increase in demand for our services as customers continue to invest in the technology related business initiatives we provide 
in addition  we see indications that demand for our services will continue to grow through as we continue to build and expand on our relationships with our existing customers 
our service revenues were million for  a increase from service revenues 
table of contents of million for  and a increase from service revenues of million for we have focused on increasing our recurring revenues and we have made progress during in furtherance of this strategic initiative and will continue to focus on increasing recurring revenue in our recurring revenues were of our services revenues in compared to in recurring revenues are revenue commitments of a year or more in which the client has committed spending levels to sapient or chosen sapient as an exclusive provider of certain services 
during  certain of these recurring revenue agreements will end  while others may be signed 
as a global company  our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the strengthening of various currencies versus the us dollar has resulted in favorable currency translation and increased our reported revenues  operating expenses and operating income 
for the year ended december   service revenues increased compared to  of which was attributable to the effects of foreign currency exchange rates 
if the us dollar strengthens against other currencies  the resulting unfavorable currency translation could result in lower reported us dollar revenues  operating expenses and operating income and result in us dollar revenue growth lower than growth in local currency terms 
we cannot predict the volatility of foreign currency rate fluctuations against the us dollar 
our annualized service revenues per billable employee declined during to  in the fourth quarter of from   and  for the third  second and first quarters of  respectively 
our utilization rate for the fourth quarter of was  compared to  and for the third  second and first quarters of  respectively 
despite our utilization rate remaining relatively flat throughout the year  the decline in our annualized service revenue per billable employee can primarily be attributed to a decline in revenue generated by contractors  which are not considered employees  from the first quarter of through the third quarter of  and a lower utilization amongst our senior people who were focused on marketing of longer term deals in the fourth quarter of compared to the third quarter of as a result of the increase in demand for our services  we have been increasing the number of our project personnel in order to effectively staff our client engagements and achieve the desired staffing mix in terms of experience level and role 
currently  we are retaining subcontractors in certain cases to fill specific project needs 
if we are not successful in maintaining effective staffing levels  our ability to achieve our service revenue and profitability objectives will be adversely affected 
our ability to effectively staff our engagements and achieve the desired staffing mix depends heavily on our ability to keep turnover at appropriate levels 
our annualized fourth quarter turnover improved to percent compared to annualized fourth quarter turnover of percent 
our full year net income was million in compared to a full year net loss of million in our full year net income reflects a return to accruing bonus expense at full bonus levels according to our annual bonus plan  in contrast to the minimal bonus expense we accrued and paid throughout our operating margin for the full year of was percent compared to a loss in the improvement in operating margin reflects our success in managing costs and improving leverage for both operating and general and administrative expenses as well as an increase in our percentage of projects staffed with people in our india office 
the improvement in general and administrative expenses from of revenue in compared to of revenue in was achieved despite an increase in spending related to sarbanes oxley section compliance efforts 
our global distributed delivery sm gdd methodology continues to increase in importance 
this proprietary methodology  which we created in  allows us to provide high quality solutions using accelerated work schedules  by utilizing india s highly skilled technology specialists  lower costs and continuous delivery capability resulting from time differences between india and the countries we serve 
we also employ our gdd methodology to provide application management services 
the billable days  or level of effort  incurred by our india people as a percentage of total company billable days decreased from for the first quarter of to for the fourth quarter of our utilization rate for our india personnel was for the fourth quarter of  as compared to  and for the first  second and third quarters of  respectively 
projects with a gdd component accounted for of our total service revenues in  compared to for and for 
table of contents although we are seeing signs of growth in our business  the economic outlook is still uncertain 
we believe that technology spending by large companies has been increasing since the second half of  however  we cannot predict for how long  and to what extent  the improvement in the market for technology consulting services will continue 
any decline in our service revenues will have a significant impact on our financial results  particularly because a significant portion of our operating costs such as personnel  rent and depreciation are fixed in advance of a particular quarter 
in addition  our future operating segment and overall company revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the number  size and scope of projects in which we are engaged  the contractual terms and degree of completion of such projects  any delays incurred in connection with a project  employee utilization rates  the adequacy of provisions for losses  the use of estimates of resources required to complete ongoing projects  general economic conditions and other factors 
summary of critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these items are regularly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ substantially from our estimates 
a summary of those accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates that we believe are most critical to fully understanding and evaluating our financial results is set forth below 
this summary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we recognize revenue from the provision of professional services under written service contracts with our clients when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been provided to the customer  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in instances where the customer  at their discretion  has the right to reject the services prior to final acceptance  revenue is deferred until such acceptance occurs 
we recognize revenues from our fixed price  fixed time technology implementation consulting contracts using the percentage of completion method pursuant to statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenues generated from fixed price  fixed time non technology implementation contracts  except for support and maintenance contracts  are recognized based upon a proportional performance model in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition 
our percentage of completion method and our proportional performance method of accounting calculate revenue based on the percentage of labor hours incurred to estimated total labor hours 
this method is used because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made  based on historical experience and milestones set in the contract 
revenue from time and material contracts is recognized as services are provided 
revenue generated from fixed price support and maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the contract term 
our project delivery and business unit finance personnel continually review labor hours incurred and estimated total labor hours  which may result in revisions to the amount of recognized revenue for a contract 
certain contracts provide for revenue to be generated based upon the achievement of certain performance standards  including million and  of revenue recognized in and  respectively 
no revenue was recognized in for performance standards 

table of contents revenues from contracts with multiple elements are allocated based on the fair value of the elements in accordance with eitf issue no 
eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
for these arrangements  we evaluate all deliverables in the contract to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting 
fair value is determined based on reliable evidence of the fair value of each deliverable 
revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate elements when the services have value on a stand alone basis  fair value of the separate elements exists and  in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element  performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in our control 
this evaluation is performed at the inception of the arrangement and as each item in the arrangement is delivered 
the evaluation involves significant judgments regarding the nature of the services and deliverables being provided  whether these services and deliverables can reasonably be divided into the separate units of accounting and the fair value of the separate elements 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed for a contract or we do not manage the project properly within the planned time period  then we may recognize a loss on the contract 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made on a contract by contract basis and are recognized in the period in which such losses are determined 
we have committed unanticipated additional resources to complete projects in the past  which has resulted in lower than anticipated profitability or losses on those contracts 
we expect that we will experience similar situations in the future 
in addition  we may fix the price for some projects at an early stage of the process  which could result in a fixed price that turns out to be too low and  therefore  could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we recognize revenue for services where collection from the client is probable  and our fees are fixed or determinable 
we establish billing terms at the time project deliverables and milestones are agreed 
our normal payment terms are days from invoice date 
revenues recognized in excess of the amounts invoiced to clients are classified as unbilled revenues 
amounts invoiced to clients in excess of revenue recognized are classified as deferred revenues 
our project delivery and business unit finance personnel continually monitor timely payments from our clients and assess any collection issues 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
we base our estimates on our historical collection and write off experience  current trends  credit policy  detailed analysis of specific client situations and percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowances we established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
if the financial condition of our clients were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment  additional allowances may be required 
our failure to accurately estimate the losses for doubtful accounts and ensure that payments are received on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
accounting for income taxes 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we evaluate all available evidence  such as recent and expected future operating results by tax jurisdiction  current and enacted tax legislation and other temporary differences between book and tax accounting  to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
as a result of operating losses incurred in  and  and uncertainty as to the extent and timing of profitability in future periods  we have recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million as of december  relating primarily to the united states 
having assessed the realizability of the deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions  we believe that future taxable income will be sufficient to realize the deferred tax benefit of the net deferred tax assets in canada and the united kingdom 
the establishment and amount of the valuation allowance requires significant estimates and judgment and can materially affect our results of operations 
if the realization of deferred tax assets in the future is 
table of contents considered more likely than not  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
our effective tax rate may vary from period to period based on changes in estimated taxable income or loss in each jurisdiction  changes to the valuation allowance  changes to federal  state or foreign tax laws  future expansion into areas with varying country  state  and local income tax rates  deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction and as a result of acquisitions 
valuation of long lived assets 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the carrying value of intangible assets and other long lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances  both internally and externally  that may suggest impairment 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
if such circumstances exist  we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets  other than goodwill  to determine if impairment exists based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that value to the carrying value of the assets 
in determining expected future cash flows  assets are grouped at the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable and independent of cash flows from other asset groups 
if the carrying value of the asset is greater than the estimated future cash flows  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
the estimated undiscounted future cash flows and valuation of long lived assets requires significant estimates and assumptions  including revenue and expense growth projections and fair value estimates such as estimated replacement cost and relief from royalty 
these estimates contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
if different estimates or adjustments were used  it is reasonably possible that our analysis would have generated materially different results 
as of december  and  we have no remaining goodwill balances 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  beginning january   we ceased amortization of goodwill  which was approximately million at that time 
we performed an impairment review of our goodwill as of january   under the transitional provisions of sfas during the second quarter of  we completed the transitional impairment test of goodwill and concluded that no impairment of the goodwill had occurred as of january  by june   our stock price had declined significantly from january   at which point our market capitalization  based on our stock price  was below our book value  and we determined that an interim goodwill impairment test should be performed 
our stock price at january  was per share and declined to per share at june  based on the analysis at june   the carrying amount of all reporting units exceeded their fair values and a goodwill impairment charge of million  representing of the goodwill balance  was recognized in the statement of operations under the caption impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for the impairment analysis requires significant estimates and assumptions  including the allocation of assets and liabilities to reporting units and fair value estimates of reporting units based on a market multiple of revenue approach 
these estimates contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
if different estimates or adjustments were used  it is reasonably possible that our analysis would have generated materially different results 
costs incurred to develop computer software for internal use 
we account for costs incurred to develop computer software for internal use in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
as required by sop  the company capitalizes the costs incurred during the application development 
table of contents stage  which include costs to design the software configuration and interfaces  coding  installation and testing 
costs incurred during the preliminary project stage along with post implementation stages of internal use computer software are expensed as incurred 
capitalized development costs are amortized over various periods up to three years 
the capitalization and ongoing assessment of recoverability of development cost requires considerable judgment by management with respect to certain external factors  including  but not limited to  technological and economic feasibility  and estimated economic life 
for the year ended december   the company capitalized computer software costs of  during  we estimate that we will incur additional costs of   that will be capitalized under sop associated with our oracle i upgrade 
amortization has not begun as of december  as the computer software has not been placed in service 
restructuring and other related charges 
we established exit plans for each of the restructuring activities which took place in and and accounted for these plans in accordance with eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
these exit plans required that we make estimates as to the nature  timing and amount of the exit costs that we specifically identified 
the consolidation of facilities required us to make estimates  which included contractual rental commitments or lease buy outs for office space vacated and related costs  offset by estimated sub lease income 
we review on a regular basis our sub lease assumptions and lease buy out assumptions 
these estimates include lease buy out costs  anticipated rates to be charged to a sub tenant  other terms and conditions in sub lease contracts  and the timing of these sub lease arrangements 
if the rental markets continue to change  our lease buy out assumptions  sub lease assumptions and space requirements may not be accurate and it is possible that changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
if any future adjustments are required to the restructuring initiatives recorded under the provisions of eitf  such adjustments will be measured in accordance with eitf sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  was effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  sfas requires that a liability for a cost that is associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
sfas supersedes the guidance in eitf issue no 
sfas includes a rebuttable presumption that if an entity has a past practice of providing similar termination benefits to employees  the benefit arrangement is presumed to be an ongoing benefit arrangement that should be accounted for under sfas  employers accounting for postemployment benefits 
sfas prescribes the accounting for the estimated cost of benefits  including severance benefits  provided by an employer to former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement 
a liability is recognized when the severance amounts relate to prior services rendered  the payment of the amount is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
since the second quarter of  we have accounted for severance related restructuring charges in accordance with sfas because we have a history of paying similar severance benefits since we have not recorded any liability related to other post employment benefits  as of december   since the amounts are neither probable nor reasonably estimable 
our remaining cash lease commitments related to restructured facilities are approximately million at december   of which is accrued in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet  and the remaining relates to sublease assumptions 
we have entered into signed sublease arrangements for approximately million  with the remaining million for future estimated sublease arrangements 
if the estimated sublease dates were to be delayed by six months  based on our current estimates  we would potentially have to recognize an additional million in our statement of operations for restructuring and other related charges 
our sublease reserve is sensitive to the level of sublease rent anticipated and the timing of sublease commencement 
a percent reduction in our sublease rate would have resulted in an additional million of charges as of the end of contingent liabilities 
we have certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities 
we accrue contingent liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated 
we are subject to various legal claims totaling approximately million and various administrative audits  each of which have arisen in the 
table of contents ordinary course of our business 
we have an accrual at december  of approximately million related to certain of these items 
we intend to defend these matters vigorously  although the ultimate outcome of these items is uncertain and the potential loss  if any  may be significantly higher or lower than the amounts we have previously accrued 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements  other than the ownership interest that we held in our joint venture in milan  italy until july   at which time our interest in the joint venture was acquired by the management team of the joint venture 
see equity investments in this part ii  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for a more detailed discussion of this joint venture 
we do not have any other arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
effect of certain transactions investment in consolidated subsidiary on january   we increased our ownership percentage in hwt  inc hwt  formerly healthwatch technologies  llc  a consolidated subsidiary by purchasing a total of  shares of hwt common stock from jerry a 
greenberg and j 
stuart moore  our co chairmen and co ceos  for a total purchase price of  in cash  or per share  which represented a substantial loss from their cost basis per share of 
messrs 
greenberg and moore are no longer shareholders of hwt 
we also commenced a tender offer on january  to purchase the remaining shares of hwt  for per share  in cash  which resulted in the purchase of  shares of hwt common stock  for a total purchase price of  as a result of these purchases  our ownership percentage in hwt increased from to 
these acquisitions were accounted for as purchases  and the purchase price was allocated primarily to customer contracts and developed technology  which are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet under the caption intangible assets  net 
these assets are being amortized on a straight line basis over lives of years 
on march   hwt issued  shares of its common stock to an executive officer of hwt in connection with the executive s initial employment with hwt 
of these  shares   were issued as restricted stock under the executive s employment agreement  and the remaining shares were purchased by the executive for per share in cash 
the restricted shares vest ratably over a period of four years 
our ownership percentage in hwt was reduced to as a result of the march issuance 
we recorded a gain of  as a result of the change in equity interest resulting from the stock issuance to the executive 
we accounted for this gain as a component of stockholders equity due to losses incurred by hwt since inception 
equity investments as of december   we have no equity investments 
on october   we invested million in dream incubator  inc di  a management consulting company that develops strategies for e businesses in japan  and acquired a interest 
under the terms of our investment agreement with di  the company had one seat on di s board of directors  with special voting rights and other privileges  and  therefore  used the equity method of accounting for this investment 
in and  our equity ownership percentage in di was diluted from approximately to approximately  as a result of subsequent sales of di s common stock 
both rounds of financing by di were at a higher price per share than what we previously paid and we recorded non cash gains of million and million for and  respectively  as a result of the change in equity interest 

table of contents during the fourth quarter of  the company discontinued its sapient kk operations in japan 
on november   as part of the dissolution of sapient kk  we agreed to unwind the cross ownership position between di and sapient kk in exchange for di lifting certain trade restrictions on its common stock owned by us

purchase obligations represent minimum commitments due to third parties  including subcontractor agreements  telecommunication contracts  it maintenance contracts in support of internal use software and hardware and other marketing and consulting contracts 
contracts for which our commitment is variable based on volumes  with no fixed minimum quantities  and contracts that can be cancelled without payment penalties  have been excluded 
amounts presented also exclude accounts payable and accrued expenses at december  cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was million for  including cash used for previously recorded restructuring activity of million  income from continuing operations of million  increases in unbilled revenue of million and in deferred revenues of million  offset by 
table of contents net non cash charges of million  including million of depreciation and amortization and increases in accrued expenses of million 
dso is calculated based on actual full year service revenue and year end receivables balance  therefore  our days sales outstanding dso for accounts receivable increased from days for to days for primarily due to an increase in receivables directly related to the increase in revenue 
we expect dso for the first quarter of to be in the range of days 
cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was million for this was due primarily to million of net purchase and sale of marketable investments and capital expenditures of million 
cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was million for  representing the cash proceeds provided from the sale of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of stock options 
the total cash outlay for the restructuring and other related activities implemented in  and is expected to be approximately million 
the remaining million of restructuring and other related costs consists of non cash charges primarily for asset write offs and leasehold improvements for facilities vacated 
as of december   million of cash had been used for restructuring and other related costs  of which million was expended during lease termination payments were million and million for and  respectively 
our estimated future restructuring and other related activities cash outlays are included in our contractual liabilities 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and marketable investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirement and expected cash outlay for our previously recorded restructuring activities for at least the next months 
on december   the board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to million over a two year period

r on our financial statements 
risk factors the following important factors  among others  could cause our actual business and financial results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this annual report or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
the demand for business and technology consulting services has improved  yet this demand may weaken significantly if the current improvement in the economic climate does not continue 
the market for our consulting services and the technologies used in our solutions historically has tended to fluctuate in tandem with economic cycles particularly those in the united states and the united kingdom  where the majority of our revenues are earned 
during economic cycles when many companies are experiencing financial difficulties or uncertainty  clients and potential clients may cancel or delay spending on technology initiatives 
moreover  during the past few years  companies typically have not exhibited the same sense of urgency to invest in technology initiatives that they exhibited during the period of economic expansion  prior to the economic uncertainty caused by recent military actions in iraq  as well as by fallout from the accounting scandals involving enron  worldcom and other companies  also has depressed technology spending 
although the economic climate has shown signs of improvement since the third quarter of  this improvement may not continue for a meaningful period of time 
if the economic climate again deteriorates  large companies may cancel or delay their business and technology consulting initiatives 
if the rate of cancellations or delays significantly increases  because of a weak economic climate or for other reasons  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our market is highly competitive and we may not be able to continue to compete effectively 
the markets for the services we provide are highly competitive 
we believe that we currently compete principally with large systems consulting and implementation firms and clients internal information systems departments 
we also compete regularly with offshore outsourcing companies  and we expect competition from these companies to increase in the future  especially on development  application management services and outsourcing engagements 
we compete to a lesser extent with specialized e business consulting firms  strategy consulting firms and packaged technology vendors 
we compete frequently for client engagements against companies with far higher revenues and larger numbers of consultants than we have 
recent consolidations of large consulting companies within our market have further increased the size and resources of some of these competitors 
these competitors are often able to offer more scale  which in some instances has enabled them to significantly discount their services in exchange for revenues in other areas or at later dates 
if we cannot keep pace with the intense competition in our marketplace  our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer 

table of contents our international operations and global distributed delivery model subject us to increased risk 
we currently have offices in the united kingdom  germany  india and canada 
our international operations are a significant percentage of our total revenues  and our global distributed delivery gdd model is a key component of our ability to successfully deliver our services 
international operations are subject to inherent risks  including economic recessions in foreign countries  fluctuations in currency exchange rates or impositions of restrictive currency controls  political instability  war or military conflict  changes in regulatory requirements  complexities and costs in effectively managing multi national operations and associated internal controls and procedures  significant changes in immigration policies or difficulties in obtaining required immigration approvals for international assignments  restrictions imposed on the import and export of technologies in countries where we operate  and reduced protection for intellectual property in some countries 
in particular  our gdd model depends heavily on our offices in new delhi and bangalore  india 
any escalation in the political or military instability in india or pakistan or the surrounding countries could hinder our ability to successfully utilize gdd  and could result in material adverse effects to our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  the delivery of our services from remote locations causes us to rely on data  phone  power and other networks which are not as reliable as those in other countries where we operate 
any failures of these systems could affect the success of our gdd model 
remote delivery of our services also increases the complexity and risk of delivering our services  which could affect our ability to satisfy our clients expectations or perform our services within the estimated time frame and budget for each project 
if we do not attract and retain qualified professional staff  we may not be able to adequately perform our client engagements and could be limited in accepting new client engagements 
our business is labor intensive  and our success depends upon our ability to attract  retain  train and motivate highly skilled employees 
the improvement in demand for business and technology consulting services that began in the third quarter of has further increased the need for employees with specialized skills or significant experience in business and technology consulting 
we have been expanding our operations in all locations and these expansion efforts will be highly dependent on attracting a sufficient number of highly skilled people 
we may not be successful in attracting enough employees to achieve our desired expansion or staffing plans 
furthermore  the industry turnover rates for these types of employees are high  and we may not be successful in retaining  training and motivating the employees we are able to attract 
any inability to attract  retain  train and motivate employees could impair our ability to adequately manage and complete existing projects and to bid for or accept new client engagements 
such inability may also force us to increase our hiring of expensive independent contractors  which could increase our costs and reduce our profitability on client engagements 
we must also devote substantial managerial and financial resources to monitoring and managing our workforce and other resources 
our future success will depend on our ability to manage the levels and related costs of our workforce and other resources effectively 
we earn revenues  incur costs and maintain cash balances in multiple currencies  and currency fluctuations could adversely affect our financial results 
we have significant international operations  and we frequently earn our revenues and incur our costs in various foreign currencies 
our international segment revenues were million in doing business in these foreign currencies exposes us to foreign currency risks in numerous areas  including revenues  purchases  
table of contents payroll and investments 
we also have a significant amount of foreign currency net asset exposures 
certain foreign currency exposures are naturally offset within an international business unit  because revenues and costs are denominated in the same foreign currency  and certain cash balances are held in us dollar denominated accounts 
however  due to the increasing size and importance of our international operations  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially impact our financial results 
our gdd model also subjects us to increased currency risk  because we frequently incur a significant portion of our project costs in indian rupees and earn revenue from our clients in other currencies 
currently  we do not hold any derivative contracts that hedge our foreign currency risk  but we may adopt such strategies in the future 
our cash position includes amounts denominated in foreign currencies 
we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds from our subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness with which these funds can be accessed 
the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries outside the united states could have adverse tax consequences and be limited by foreign currency exchange controls 
however  those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations 
we have transferred  and will continue to transfer  cash from those subsidiaries to the parent company  and to other international subsidiaries  when it is cost effective to do so 
however  any fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially impact the availability and size of these funds for repatriation or transfer 
we have significant fixed operating costs  which may be difficult to adjust in response to unanticipated fluctuations in revenues 
a high percentage of our operating expenses  particularly personnel  rent and depreciation  are fixed in advance of any particular quarter 
as a result  an unanticipated decrease in the number or average size of  or an unanticipated delay in the scheduling for  our projects may cause significant variations in operating results in any particular quarter and could have a material adverse effect on operations for that quarter 
an unanticipated termination or decrease in size or scope of a major project  a client s decision not to proceed with a project we anticipated or the completion during a quarter of several major client projects could require us to maintain underutilized employees and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our revenues and earnings may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter because of such factors as the contractual terms and timing of completion of projects  including achievement of certain business results  any delays incurred in connection with projects  the adequacy of provisions for losses and bad debts  the accuracy of our estimates of resources required to complete ongoing projects  loss of key highly skilled personnel necessary to complete projects  and general economic conditions 
we may lose money if we do not accurately estimate the costs of fixed price engagements 
most of our projects are based on fixed price  fixed time contracts  rather than contracts in which payment to us is determined on a time and materials basis 
our failure to accurately estimate the resources required for a project  or our failure to complete our contractual obligations in a manner consistent with the project plan upon which our fixed price  fixed time contract was based  could adversely affect our overall profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are increasingly entering into contracts for large projects  which magnifies this risk 
we have been required to commit unanticipated additional resources to complete projects in the past  which has resulted in losses on those contracts 
we will likely experience similar situations in the future 
in addition  we may fix the price for some projects at an early stage of the process  which could result in a fixed price that turns out to be too low and  therefore  could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our clients could unexpectedly terminate their contracts for our services 
some of our contracts can be canceled by the client with limited advance notice and without significant penalty 
termination by any client of a contract for our services could result in a loss of expected revenues and additional expenses for staff which were allocated to that client s project 
we could be required to maintain underutilized employees who were assigned to the terminated contract 
the unexpected cancellation or significant reduction in the scope of any of our large projects could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be liable to our clients for damages caused by our services or by our failure to remedy system failures 
many of our projects involve technology applications or systems that are critical to the operations of our clients businesses and handle very large volumes of transactions 
if we fail to perform our services correctly  we may be unable to deliver applications or systems to our clients with the promised functionality or within the promised time frame  or to satisfy the required service levels for support and maintenance 
while we have taken precautionary actions to create redundancy and back up systems  any such failures by us could result in claims by our clients for substantial damages against us 
although we attempt to limit the amount and type of our contractual liability for defects in the applications or systems we provide  and carry insurance coverage which mitigates this liability in certain instances  we cannot be assured that these limitations and insurance coverages will be applicable and enforceable in all cases 
even if these limitations and insurance coverages are found to be applicable and enforceable  our liability to our clients for these types of claims could be material in amount and affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we put a portion of our fees at risk based on project results and may not earn these fees if we do not succeed 
our business model focuses heavily on delivering measurable business results for our clients  and increasingly we are aligning our interests with our client s interests by putting a portion of our fees at risk  dependent on our client s attainment of the business value we promised 
in  we recognized million of revenue by achieving previously agreed measurable business results 
our inability to deliver the business value that we have promised on a project could materially affect the profitability of that project  because we typically will incur the same level of project costs regardless of whether the promised business value is attained 
we could also experience delays in revenue recognition or payment because the measurement of business value is often complex and may involve a verification process between us and our client 
as a result  our failure to deliver the business value that we promise to our clients could materially affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our stock price is volatile and may result in substantial losses for investors 
the trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations 
our trading price could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results and achievement of key business metrics by us or our competitors  changes in operating results estimates by securities analysts  any differences between our reported results and securities analysts published or unpublished expectations  announcements of new contracts or service offerings made by us or our competitors  announcements of acquisitions or joint ventures made by us or our competitors  and general economic or stock market conditions 

table of contents in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
the commencement of this type of litigation against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
we may be unable to protect our proprietary methodology 
our success depends  in part  upon our proprietary methodology and other intellectual property rights 
we rely upon a combination of trade secrets  nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements  and copyright and trademark laws to protect our proprietary rights 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  subcontractors  vendors  consultants and clients  and limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
we cannot be certain that the steps we take in this regard will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
in addition  although we believe that our services and products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  infringement claims may be asserted against us in the future  and  if asserted  these claims may be successful 
a successful claim against us could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our co chairmen and co ceos have significant voting power and may effectively control the outcome of any stockholder vote 
jerry a 
greenberg and j 
stuart moore  our co chairmen of the board of directors and co chief executive officers  own approximately of our common stock in the aggregate 
as a result  they have the ability to substantially influence  and may effectively control the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors 
this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of sapient  even if such a change in control would benefit other investors 
we are dependent on our key employees 
our success will depend in large part upon the continued services of a number of key employees  including messrs 
greenberg and moore 
our employment arrangements with messrs 
greenberg and moore and with our other key personnel provide that employment is terminable at will by either party 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if our key employees resign from sapient to join a competitor or to form a competing company  the loss of such personnel and any resulting loss of existing or potential clients to any such competitor could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although we require our employees to sign agreements prohibiting them from joining a competitor  forming a competing company or soliciting our clients or employees for certain periods of time  we cannot be certain that these agreements will be effective in preventing our key employees from engaging in these actions or that courts or other adjudicative entities will substantially enforce these agreements 
furthermore  for those employees whom we involuntarily terminated in connection with our restructuring actions  we have waived the non competition clause of their agreements in exchange for releases of claims 
we granted these waivers only in connection with the restructuring actions  and our general practice is not to waive the non competition obligations of other departing employees 
we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits from acquisitions and joint ventures 
the anticipated benefits from any acquisitions or joint ventures that we may undertake might not be achieved 
for example  if we acquire a company  we cannot be certain that clients of the acquired business will continue to conduct business with us  or that employees of the acquired business will continue their employment or integrate successfully into our operations and culture 
the identification  consummation and integration of acquisitions and joint ventures require substantial attention from management 
the diversion of management s attention  as well as any difficulties encountered in the integration process  could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  we may incur significant expenses in completing any such acquisitions  and we may assume significant liabilities  some of which may be unknown at the time of such acquisition 

table of contents the failure to successfully and timely implement an upgrade of our corporate financial system could harm our business 
in april  we commenced an implementation of oracle lli financials to upgrade our current financial systems 
the oracle lli financials implementation is anticipated to be completed in the second and third fiscal quarters of the implementation will  among other benefits  increase the automation of  and ensure greater internal control and productivity for  our financial processes  as well as enable centralization of business functions within the company and improve our data integrity  controls  and the use of our people and systems 
failure to successfully implement the new system in a timely  effective and efficient manner could result in the disruption of our operations  the inability to comply with our sarbanes oxley obligations and the inability to report our financial results in a timely manner 
our corporate governance provisions may deter a financially attractive takeover attempt 
provisions of our charter and by laws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable  including a transaction in which stockholders would receive a premium for their shares 
these provisions include the following our board of directors has the authority  without further action by the stockholders  to fix the rights and preferences of and issue shares of preferred stock  any action that may be taken by stockholders must be taken at an annual or special meeting and may not be taken by written consent  stockholders must comply with advance notice requirements before raising a matter at a meeting of stockholders or nominating a director for election  and a chairman of the board or a chief executive officer are the only persons who may call a special meeting of stockholders 
provisions of delaware law may also discourage  delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not believe that we have any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments 
at december   our exposure to market risk relates primarily to changes in interest rates on our investment portfolio 
our marketable investments consist primarily of fixed income securities 
we invest only with high credit quality issuers and we do not currently use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we do not believe that a significant increase or decrease in interest rates would have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
exchange rate sensitivity we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates  as a significant portion of our revenues  expenses  assets  and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the british pound  the euro  the indian rupee and the canadian dollar 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve 
currently  we do not hold any derivative contracts that hedge our foreign currency risk  but we may adopt such strategies in the future 
for a discussion of the risks we face as a result of foreign currency fluctuations  please see risk factors in part ii management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
