item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are a leading manufacturer and distributor of agricultural equipment and related replacement parts throughout the world 
we sell a full range of agricultural equipment  including tractors  combines  hay tools  sprayers  forage equipment and implements and a line of diesel engines 
our products are distributed under the various well known brand names agco  challenger  fendt  gleaner  hesston  massey ferguson  new idea  rogator  spra coupe  sunflower  terra gator  valtra  and white tm planters 
we distribute most of our products through a combination of approximately  independent dealers  distributors  associates and licensees 
in addition  we provide retail financing in north america  the united kingdom  australia  france  germany  ireland and brazil through our finance joint ventures with rabobank 
results of operations we sell our equipment and replacement parts to our independent dealers  distributors and other customers 
a large majority of our sales are to independent dealers and distributors that sell our products to the end user 
to the extent practicable  we attempt to sell products to our dealers and distributors on a level basis throughout the year to reduce the effect of seasonal demands on our manufacturing operations and to minimize our investment in inventory 
however  retail sales by dealers to farmers are highly seasonal and are linked to the planting and harvesting seasons 
in certain markets  particularly in north america  there is often a time lag  which varies based on the timing and level of retail demand  between our sale of the equipment to the dealer and the dealer s sale to a retail customer 
during this time lag between the wholesale and retail sale  dealers may not return equipment to us unless the dealer s contract is terminated or we agree to accept returned products 
in most cases  commissions payable under our salesman incentive programs are paid at the time of the retail sale  as opposed to when the products are sold to dealers

recent acquisitions on january   we acquired the valtra tractor and diesel engine operations of kone corporation  a finnish company  for million  net of approximately million cash acquired or approximately million  net 
valtra is a global tractor and off road engine manufacturer in the nordic region of europe and latin america 
the acquisition of valtra provided us with the opportunity to expand our business in significant global markets by utilizing valtra s technology and productivity leadership in the agricultural equipment market 
the acquired assets and liabilities consisted primarily of inventories  accounts receivable  
table of contents property  plant and equipment  technology  tradenames  trademarks  customer relationships and patents 
the results of operations for the valtra acquisition have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
the valtra acquisition was accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  and accordingly  we have allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the acquisition date 
we recorded approximately million of goodwill and approximately million of other identifiable intangible assets such as tradenames  trademarks  technology and related patents  and customer relationship intangibles as part of the purchase price allocation 
we completed the initial funding of the cash purchase price of valtra through the issuance of million principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes in december  funds borrowed under revolving credit and term loan facilities that were entered into january   and million borrowed under an interim bridge facility that was also closed on january  see liquidity and capital resources for additional information 
we have applied to the brazilian competition authority for its approval of the purchase of valtra 
at this time  we cannot predict with certainty when or whether the brazlian competition authority will grant its approval 
under brazilian law  we were permitted to complete the purchase of valtra without having received such approval  however  the brazilian competition authority has  while considering our request for approval  imposed conditions on how we operate both valtra s brazilian business and our existing brazilian business 
these conditions include a requirement to maintain all manufacturing facilities  brands  products and distribution channels that existed prior to the acquisition 
the timing and the conditions of such approval may delay or prevent us from fully executing our business plan for operating the valtra business and our existing business or may force us to sell a portion of the valtra business or our existing business 
any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

valtra finland administrative rationalization during the fourth quarter of  we initiated the restructuring of certain administrative functions within our finnish tractor manufacturing operations  resulting in the termination of approximately employees 
this rationalization was completed to improve our ongoing overhead cost structure 
we recorded severance 
table of contents costs of approximately million associated with this rationalization 
the rationalization is more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
randers  denmark rationalization on july   we announced a plan to restructure our european combine manufacturing operations located in randers  denmark 
the restructuring plan will reduce the cost and complexity of the randers manufacturing operation  by simplifying the model range and eliminating the facility s component manufacturing operations 
we will outsource manufacturing of the majority of parts and components to suppliers and retain critical key assembly operations at the randers facility 
by retaining only the facility assembly operations  we will reduce the randers workforce by approximately employees and permanently eliminate of the square footage utilized 
our plans also include a rationalization of the combine model range to be assembled in randers  retaining the production of high specification  high value combines 
as a result of the restructuring plan  we estimate that it will generate annual savings of approximately million to million 
cash restructuring costs recorded during were approximately million  which were primarily related to employee severance and retention payments 
in addition  we recorded an million write down of property  plant and equipment during associated with the impairment of real estate and machinery and equipment within the component manufacturing operations 
the rationalization is more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we have also recorded approximately million of inventory write downs reflected in costs of goods sold  related to inventory that was identified as obsolete as a result of the restructuring plan 
coventry rationalization during  we announced and initiated a restructuring plan related to the closure of our tractor manufacturing facility in coventry  england and the relocation of existing production at coventry to our beauvais  france and canoas  brazil manufacturing facilities  resulting in the termination of approximately  employees 
the closure of this facility is consistent with our strategy to reduce excess manufacturing capacity 
the facility manufactured transaxles and assembled tractors in the range of horsepower 
the trend towards higher horsepower tractors resulting from the consolidation of farms had caused this product segment of the industry to decline over recent years  which negatively impacted the facility s utilization 
in  we completed the transfer of production to our beauvais facility  although we experienced cost inefficiencies and production delays primarily due to supplier delivery issues 
those inefficiencies were largely corrected in we estimate that we have reduced manufacturing overhead costs as a result of the coventry rationalization project by approximately million when adjusted for changes in production volume from year to year 
approximately million and million of restructuring and other infrequent expenses were recorded associated with this rationalization during and  respectively 
the charge included a million impairment charge associated with the write down of property  plant and equipment resulting from the facility closure 
during  we reversed approximately million of provisions related to the restructuring that had been previously established to reflect more accurate estimates of remaining obligations 
we also recorded a gain on the sale of the facility of approximately million that was sold in january  as well as approximately million and million of gains on the sale of related machinery and equipment during and  respectively 
the components of the restructuring and other infrequent expenses income recorded during  and are summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in october  we applied to the high court in london  england  for clarification of a provision in our uk pension plan that governs the value of pension payments payable to an employee who is over years old and who retires from service in certain circumstances prior to his normal retirement date 
the primary matter before the high court was whether pension payments to such employees  including those who take early retirement and those terminated due to the closure of our coventry facility  should be reduced to compensate for the fact that the pension payments begin prior to a normal retirement age of in december  the high court ruled against our position that reduced pension payments are payable in the context of early retirements or terminations 
we appealed the high court s ruling  and in july  the court of 
table of contents appeal ruled that employees terminated as a result of the closure of the coventry facility do not qualify for full pensions  thereby reversing the earlier high court ruling for this aspect of the case  but ruled that other employees might qualify 
the representatives of the beneficiaries of the pension plan sought the right to appeal to the house of lords  and on march   the house of lords denied their request 
as a result of the high court s ruling in that case  certain employees who took early retirement in prior years under voluntary retirement arrangements would be entitled to additional payments  and therefore we recorded a charge in the second quarter of  included in restructuring and other infrequent expenses  of approximately million or approximately million to reflect our estimate of the additional pension liability associated with previous early retirement programs 
subsequently  as full details of the court of appeal judgment were published  we received more detailed legal advice regarding the specific circumstances in which the past voluntary retirements would be subject to the court s ruling 
based on this advice  we completed a detailed review of past terminations during the fourth quarter of  and concluded that the number of former employees who are considered to be eligible to receive enhanced pensions under the court s ruling was lower than our initial estimate 
we therefore reduced the established provision by approximately million or approximately million during the fourth quarter of  which was included in restructuring and other infrequent expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
dekalb rationalization in march  we announced the closure of our challenger track tractor facility located in dekalb  illinois and the relocation of production to our facility in jackson  minnesota 
production at the dekalb facility ceased in may and was relocated and resumed in the minnesota facility in june the dekalb plant assembled challenger track tractors in the range of to horsepower 
after a review of cost reduction alternatives  it was determined that current and future production levels at that time were not sufficient to support a stand alone track tractor site 
in connection with the restructuring plan  we recorded approximately million of restructuring and other infrequent expenses during  which included the termination of approximately employees 
we estimate that we have reduced costs during by approximately million as a result of the closure 
we sold the dekalb facility real estate during the fourth quarter of for approximately million before associated selling costs  and recorded a net loss on the sale of the facilities of approximately million 
the loss was reflected in restructuring and other infrequent expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
the components of the restructuring expenses incurred during are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
 and functional rationalizations during and  we initiated several rationalization plans and recorded restructuring and other infrequent expenses of approximately million and million  respectively 
the expenses primarily related to severance costs and certain lease termination and other exit costs associated with the rationalization of our european engineering and marketing personnel  certain components of our german manufacturing facilities located in kempten and marktoberdorf  germany  as well as a european combine engineering rationalization that was initiated during during  we recorded million of restructuring and other infrequent expenses associated with these european rationalization initiatives  as well as million of charges related to the closure and consolidation of valtra s us and canadian sales offices into our existing us and canadian sales organizations 
of the million of total costs  approximately million relate to severance costs associated with the termination of approximately employees in total 
these rationalizations were completed to improve our ongoing cost structure and to reduce cost of goods sold  as well as engineering and sg a expenses 
these expenses are discussed more fully in note to our consolidated financial statements 
through rationalizations in  we announced our plans to rationalize certain facilities as part of the ag chem acquisition integration  and we consolidated our willmar  minnesota manufacturing facility and our ag chem benson  minnesota manufacturing facility into ag chem s jackson  minnesota manufacturing plant 
we recorded 
table of contents approximately million associated with the rationalization during and approximately million of costs during during the fourth quarter of  we wrote down the carrying value of the real estate of the willmar facility and recorded an impairment charge of approximately million  which was reflected in restructuring and other infrequent expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
during the fourth quarter of  we sold a portion of the willmar facility for approximately million 
in  we permanently closed our combine manufacturing facility in independence  missouri  and in  we permanently closed our coldwater  ohio manufacturing facility 
we did not record any restructuring and other infrequent expenses in or related to these closures 
during  we sold the independence and coldwater facilities and recorded a net gain on the sale of the two facilities of approximately million  which was reflected in restructuring and other infrequent expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
these rationalization initiatives are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
in the preparation of these financial statements  we make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the financial statements are detailed in note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that our application of the policies discussed below involve significant levels of judgments  estimates and complexity 
allowance for doubtful accounts we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by actively monitoring the financial condition of our customers to determine the potential for any nonpayment of trade receivables 
in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts  we also consider other economic factors such as aging trends 
we believe that our process of specific review of customers combined with overall analytical review provides an effective evaluation of ultimate collectibility of trade receivables 
our loss experience was approximately of net sales in discount and sales incentive allowances allowances for discounts and sales incentives are made at the time of sale based on retail sales incentive programs available to the dealer or retail customer 
the cost of these programs depends on various factors including the timing of the retail sale and the programs in place at that time 
these retail sales incentives may also be revised between the time we record the sale and the time the retail sale occurs 
we monitor these factors and revise our provisions when necessary 
at december   we had recorded an allowance for discounts and sales incentives of approximately million 
if we were to allow an additional of sales incentives and discounts at the time of retail sale  our reserve would increase by approximately million as of december  conversely  if we were to decrease our sales incentives and discounts by at the time of retail sale  our reserve would decrease by approximately million 
inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
determination of cost includes estimates for surplus and obsolete inventory based on estimates of future sales and production 
changes in demand and product design can impact these estimates 
we periodically evaluate and update our assumptions when assessing the adequacy of inventory adjustments 
deferred income taxes we establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we estimate it is more likely than not that the tax assets will not be realized 
we base these estimates on projections of future income  including tax 
table of contents planning strategies  in certain tax jurisdictions 
changes in industry conditions and the competitive environment may impact the accuracy of our projections 
in  we recognized a non cash income tax charge of million related to increasing the valuation allowance for certain united states deferred tax assets

 we periodically assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and determine if adjustments to the valuation allowance are appropriate 
as a result of these assessments  there are certain tax jurisdictions where we do not benefit further losses 
we have not benefited losses generated in the united states in and or with respect to the losses incurred in denmark in at december  and  we had deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances  of million and million  respectively  including million and million  respectively  related to net operating loss carryforwards 
at december  and  we had recorded total valuation allowances as an offset to the deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively  primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards in argentina  denmark and the united states 
realization of the remaining net deferred tax assets depends on generating sufficient taxable income in future periods 
we believe it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized 
warranty and additional service actions see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for warranties 
we make provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranties at the time products are sold 
we base these estimates on historical experience of the nature  frequency and average cost of warranty claims 
in addition  the number and magnitude of additional service actions expected to be approved  and policies related to additional service actions  are taken into consideration 
due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these estimated factors  changes in our assumptions could materially affect net income 
our estimate of warranty obligations is reevaluated on a quarterly basis 
experience has shown that initial data for any product series line can be volatile  therefore  our process relies upon long term historical averages until sufficient data is available 
as actual experience becomes available  it is used to modify the historical averages to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes 
resulting balances are then compared with present spending rates to ensure that the accruals are adequate to meet expected future obligations 
insurance reserves we provide insurance reserves for our estimates of losses due to claims for worker s compensation  product liability and other liabilities for which we are self insured 
we base these estimates on the ultimate settlement amount of claims  which often have long periods of resolution 
we closely monitor the claims to maintain adequate reserves 
pensions we have defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees principally in the united states  the united kingdom  germany  finland  norway  france  australia and brazil 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits 
nature of estimates required the measurement of our pension obligations  costs and liabilities is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries as provided by management 
these assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience 
these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 

table of contents assumptions and approach used the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors discount rates inflation salary growth expected return on plan assets retirement rates mortality rates we base the discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for our us pension plans on the moody s investor service aa bond yield as of december of each year 
for our non us plans  we base the discount rate on comparable indices within each of those countries 
the measurement date with respect to our uk pension scheme is september of each year 
our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
the salary growth assumptions reflects our long term actual experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
the expected return on plan assets assumptions reflects asset allocations  investment strategy and the views of investment managers 
retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience 
the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense in such periods 
our us and us pension plans represent approximately of our consolidated projected benefit obligation as of december  if the discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for our us plans was decreased by basis points  our projected benefit obligation would have increased by approximately million at december   and our pension expense would increase by a nominal amount 
if the discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for our us plans was increased by basis points  our projected benefit obligation would have decreased by approximately million  and our pension expense would decrease by a nominal amount 
if the discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for our uk scheme was decreased by basis points  our projected benefit obligation would have increased by approximately million at december   and our pension expense would increase by approximately million 
if the discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for our uk scheme was increased by basis points  our projected benefit obligation would have decreased by approximately million at december   and our pension expense would decrease by approximately million 
other postretirement benefits retiree health care and life insurance we provide certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for certain employees principally in the united states 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for other postretirement benefits 
nature of estimates required 
the measurement of our obligations  costs and liabilities associated with other postretirement benefits ie  retiree health care and life insurance requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as health care cost increases  salary increases and demographic experience  which may have an effect on the amount and timing of future payments 
assumptions and approach used 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors health care cost trends inflation discount rates expected return on plan assets salary growth mortality rates retirement rates our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook  efficiencies and other cost mitigation actions including further employee cost sharing  administrative improvements and other efficiencies and an assessment of likely long term trends 
we base the discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for our us postretirement benefit plans on the moody s 
table of contents investor service aa bond yield as of december of each year 
our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
the salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience 
the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods 
if the discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for our us postretirement benefit plans were decreased by basis points  our projected benefit obligation would have increased by approximately million at december   and our pension expense would increase by approximately million 
if the discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for our us postretirement benefit plans was increased by basis points  our projected benefit obligation would have decreased by approximately million  and our pension expense would decrease by approximately million 
for measuring the expected postretirement benefit obligation at december   a health care cost trend rate was assumed for  decreasing per year to and remaining at that level thereafter 
changing the assumed health care cost trend rates by one percentage point each year and holding all other assumptions constant would have the following effect to service and interest cost for and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december  in millions one one percentage percentage point point increase decrease effect on service and interest cost effect on accumulated benefit obligation litigation we are party to various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business 
we closely monitor these claims and lawsuits and frequently consult with our legal counsel to determine whether or not they may  when resolved  have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
goodwill and indefinite lived assets on january   we adopted sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
required that an initial impairment assessment be performed on all goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in the first quarter of sfas no 
also established a method of testing goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
our initial assessment and our annual assessments involve determining an estimate of the fair value of our reporting units in order to evaluate whether an impairment of the current carrying amount of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets exists 
fair values are derived based on an evaluation of past and expected future performance of our reporting units 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment eg  a component 
a component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and our executive management team regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
in addition  we combine and aggregate two or more components of an operating segment as a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics 
our reportable segments reported under the guidance of sfas no 
are not our reporting units  with the exception of our asia pacific geographical segment 
we utilized a combination of valuation techniques  including a discounted cash flow approach  a market multiple approach and a comparable transaction approach when making our initial and subsequent annual and interim assessments 
as part of our adoption of sfas no 
in  we determined that goodwill associated with our argentina and agco north american reporting units was impaired  due to the fact that the enterprise book values of these reporting units were greater than their respective calculated fair values 

table of contents as a result  we recorded a pre tax write down of goodwill of million  which resulted in reducing the carrying value of both the argentina and agco north american reporting units goodwill to zero 
this write down was recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million  net of million in income taxes  in the first quarter of as stated above  goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and more often if indications of impairment exist 
the results of our analyses conducted as of october  and  respectively  indicated that no further reduction in the carrying amount of goodwill was required in and due to the level of judgment  complexity and period of time over which many of these items are resolved  actual results could differ from those estimated at the time of preparation of the financial statements 
adjustments to these estimates would impact our financial position and future results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources our financing requirements are subject to variations due to seasonal changes in inventory and receivable levels 
internally generated funds are supplemented when necessary from external sources  primarily our revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facilities 
as a result of the valtra acquisition  we completed a number of debt and equity capital transactions which provided funding for the valtra acquisition and refinanced the majority of our outstanding debt facilities 
our current financing and funding sources are million principal amount convertible senior subordinated notes due  million principal amount senior subordinated notes due  million principal amount senior notes due  approximately million of accounts receivable securitization facilities  a million revolving credit facility  a million term loan facility and a million term loan facility 
on december   we sold million of convertible senior subordinated notes due under a private placement offering 
the convertible senior subordinated notes are unsecured obligations and are convertible into shares of our common stock upon satisfaction of certain conditions  as discussed below 
interest is payable on the notes at per annum  payable semi annually in arrears in cash on september and december of each year  beginning september  the convertible senior subordinated notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at an effective price of per share  subject to adjustment 
holders of the notes may convert the notes into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes  subject to adjustment  prior to the close of business on december   only under the following circumstances during any fiscal quarter  if the closing sales price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price for at least trading days in the consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter  during the five business day period after a five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per note for each day of that period was less than of the product of the closing sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate  if the notes have been called for redemption  or upon the occurrence of certain corporate transactions 
beginning january   we may redeem any of the notes at a redemption price of of their principal amount  plus accrued interest 
holders of the notes may require us to repurchase the notes at a repurchase price of of their principal amount  plus accrued interest  on december     and on january   we entered into a new credit facility that provides for a million multi currency revolving credit facility  a million us dollar denominated term loan and a million euro denominated term loan 
this facility replaced our million multi currency revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility will mature in march the maturity date of the revolving credit facility may be extended to december if our existing senior notes due are refinanced on terms specified by the lenders prior to march both term loans will amortize at the rate of one percent per annum until the maturity date 
we were required to prepay approximately million of the us dollar denominated term loan and million of the euro denominated term loan as a result of excess proceeds received from the common stock public offering in april beginning on march   and each year thereafter  we may be required to prepay a portion of the term loans depending on the amount of cash flow generated in the prior 
table of contents year 
in addition to these prepayments  we are required to make quarterly payments towards the us dollar denominated term loan and euro denominated term loan of million and million  respectively 
the maturity date for the term loans is march the maturity date of the term loans may be extended to june if the senior notes are refinanced on terms specified by the lenders prior to march the revolving credit and term loan facilities are secured by a majority of our us  canadian  finnish and uk based assets and a pledge of a portion of the stock of our domestic and material foreign subsidiaries 
interest accrues on amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility  at our option  at either libor plus a margin ranging between and based upon our senior debt ratio or the higher of the administrative agent s base lending rate or one half of one percent over the federal funds rate plus a margin ranging between and based on our senior debt ratio 
interest accrues on amounts outstanding under the term loans at libor plus 
the credit facility contains covenants restricting  among other things  the incurrence of indebtedness and the making of certain payments  including dividends 
we must also fulfill financial covenants including  among others  a total debt to ebitda ratio  a senior debt to ebitda ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in the facility 
as of december   we had total borrowings of million under the credit facility  which included million under the us dollar denominated term loan facility and million approximately million under the euro denominated term loan facility 
as of december   we had availability to borrow million under the revolving credit facility 
on april   we sold  shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering  and received proceeds of approximately million 
we used the net proceeds to repay a million interim bridge loan facility that we used in part to acquire valtra  to repay borrowings under our credit facility  and to pay offering related fees and expenses 
on april   we sold million of senior subordinated notes due  and received proceeds of approximately million  after offering related fees and expenses 
the senior subordinated notes are unsecured obligations and are subordinated in right of payment to our senior notes  and any existing or future senior indebtedness 
interest is payable on the notes semi annually on april and october of each year  beginning october  beginning april   we may redeem the notes  in whole or in part  initially at of their principal amount  plus accrued interest  declining to of their principal amount  plus accrued interest  at any time on or after april  in addition  before april   we may redeem the notes  in whole or in part  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued interest plus a make whole premium 
before april   we also may redeem up to of the notes at of their principal amount using the proceeds from sales of certain kinds of capital stock 
the notes include covenants restricting the incurrence of indebtedness and the making of certain restricted payments  including dividends

the senior notes include covenants restricting the incurrence of indebtedness and the making of certain restricted payments  including dividends 
our business is subject to substantial cyclical variations  which generally are difficult to forecast 
our results of operations may also vary from time to time resulting from costs associated with rationalization plans and acquisitions 
as a result  we have had to request relief from our lenders on occasion with respect to financial covenant compliance 
while we do not currently anticipate asking for any relief  it is possible that we would require relief in the future 
based upon our historical working relationship with our lenders  we currently do not anticipate any difficulty in obtaining that relief 

table of contents under our securitization facilities  we sell accounts receivable in the united states  canada and europe on a revolving basis to commercial paper conduits either on a direct basis or through a wholly owned special purpose entity 
at december   the aggregate amount of these facilities was million 
during the second quarter  we amended certain provisions of its united states and canada receivable securitization facilities  primarily to increase the facilities by million and million  respectively  and to eliminate default triggers associated with our credit ratings 
the outstanding funded balance of million as of december  has the effect of reducing accounts receivable and short term liabilities by the same amount 
our risk of loss under the securitization facilities is limited to a portion of the unfunded balance of receivables sold  which is approximately of the funded amount 
we maintain reserves for doubtful accounts associated with this risk 
if the facilities were terminated  we would not be required to repurchase previously sold receivables but would be prevented from selling additional receivables to the commercial paper conduit 
the european facility agreement provides that the agent  rabobank  has the right to terminate the securitization facilities if our senior unsecured debt rating moves below b by standard poor s or b by moody s investor services 
based on our current ratings  a downgrade of two levels by standard poor s and two levels by moody s would need to occur 
we are currently in discussions with the conduit purchaser to have the ratings triggers eliminated from the agreement 
the us and canadian securitization facilities expire in april and the european facility in april but are subject to annual renewals 
these facilities allow us to sell accounts receivables through financing conduits which obtain funding from commercial paper markets 
future funding under securitization facilities depends upon the adequacy of receivables  a sufficient demand for the underlying commercial paper and the maintenance of certain covenants concerning the quality of the receivables and our financial condition 
in the event commercial paper demand is not adequate  our securitization facilities provide for liquidity backing from various financial institutions including rabobank 
these liquidity commitments would provide us with interim funding to allow us to find alternative sources of working capital financing  if necessary 
cash flow provided by operating activities was million for  compared to million for the increase in operating cash flow is a result of higher earnings as well as decreases in working capital excluding the impact of the valtra acquisition as more fully described below 
in addition  during  we had cash restructuring payments relating primarily to the closure of the coventry facility of approximately million compared to million in our working capital requirements are seasonal  with investments in working capital typically building in the first half of the year and then reducing in the second half of the year 
we had  million in working capital at december   as compared with million at december  accounts receivable and inventories  combined  were million higher than at december  the increase includes approximately million of receivables and inventories related to the valtra acquisition 
the remaining increase in inventories and receivables is due primarily to sales growth and foreign currency translation 
capital expenditures for were million compared to million in capital expenditures made during were primarily related to enhancing new and existing products and facility  equipment and systems improvements 
our debt to capitalization ratio  which is total long term debt divided by the sum of total long term debt and stockholders equity  was at december  compared to at december  the increase is primarily attributable to higher debt incurred to fund the valtra acquisition 
from time to time  we review and will continue to review acquisition and joint venture opportunities as well as changes in the capital markets 
if we were to consummate a significant acquisition or elect to take advantage of favorable opportunities in the capital markets  we may supplement availability or revise the terms under our credit facilities or complete public or private offerings of equity or debt securities 
we believe that available borrowings under the revolving credit facility  funding under the accounts receivable securitization facilities  available cash  and internally generated funds will be sufficient to support our working capital  capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 

table of contents contractual obligations the future payments required under our significant contractual obligations  excluding foreign currency forward contracts  as of december  are as follows in millions payments due by period to to and total beyond long term debt interest payments related to long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations unconditional purchase obligations other short term and long term obligations total contractual cash obligations amount of commitment expiration per period to to and total beyond standby letters of credit and similar instruments guarantees standby repurchase obligations other commercial commitments total commercial commitments and lines of credit estimated interest payments are calculated assuming current interest rates over minimum maturity periods specified in debt agreements 
debt may be repaid sooner or later than such minimum maturity periods 
unconditional purchase obligations exclude routine purchase orders entered into in the normal course of business 
as a result of the rationalization of our european combine manufacturing operations during  we entered into an agreement with a third party manufacturer to produce certain combine model ranges over a five year period 
the agreement provides that we will purchase a minimum quantity of combines per year  at a cost of approximately million per year through december other short term and long term obligations include estimates of future minimum contribution requirements under our us and us defined benefit pension and postretirement plans 
these estimates are based on current legislation in the countries we operate within and are subject to change 
off balance sheet arrangements guarantees at december   we were obligated under certain circumstances to purchase  through the year  up to million of equipment upon expiration of certain operating leases between agco finance llc and agco finance canada ltd  our retail finance joint ventures in north america  and end users 
we also maintain a remarketing agreement with these joint ventures whereby we are obligated to repurchase repossessed inventory at market values 
on december   we entered into an agreement with agco finance llc which limits our purchase obligations under this arrangement to million in the aggregate per calendar year 
we believe that any losses  which might be incurred on the resale of this equipment  will not materially impact our financial position or results of operations

 and have determined that these facilities should be accounted for as off balance sheet transactions in accordance with sfas no 
at december   we guaranteed indebtedness owed to third parties of approximately million  primarily related to dealer and end user financing of equipment 
we believe the credit risk associated with these guarantees is not material to our financial position

contingencies we have received assessments from brazilian tax authorities regarding transaction taxes payable on certain foreign currency gains and losses 
we are currently contesting the assessments and disputing the calculation method applied by the tax authorities 
we believe that it is not probable or likely the assessments will have to be paid 
the total assessment approximates million to million 
we anticipate that it may take significant time to resolve the dispute with the brazilian tax authorities 
in october we were notified of a customer claim for costs and damages arising out of alleged breaches of a supply agreement 
the customer s initial evaluation indicated a claim of approximately million or approximately million

rabobank is also the principal agent and participant in our revolving credit facility and our securitization facilities 
the majority of the assets of our retail finance joint ventures represent finance receivables 
the majority of the liabilities represent notes payable and accrued interest 
under the various joint venture agreements  rabobank or its affiliates are obligated to provide financing to the joint venture companies  primarily through lines of credit 
we do not guarantee the debt obligations of the retail finance joint ventures other than  or approximately million  of the solvency requirements of the brazil joint venture 
in brazil  our joint venture company has an agency relationship with rabobank whereby rabobank provides funding 
our retail finance joint ventures provide retail financing and wholesale financing to our dealers 
the terms of the financing arrangements offered to our dealers are similar to arrangements they provide to unaffiliated third parties 
as discussed previously  at december  we were obligated under certain circumstances to purchase through the year up to million of equipment upon expiration of certain operating leases between agco finance llc and agco finance canada ltd  our retail joint ventures in north america  and end users 
we also maintain a remarketing agreement with these joint ventures  as discussed under off balance sheet arrangements 
in addition  as part of sales incentives provided to end users  we may from time to time subsidize interest rates of retail financing provided by our retail joint ventures 
the cost of those programs is recognized at the time of sale to our dealers

outlook our operations are subject to the cyclical nature of the agricultural industry 
sales of our equipment have been and are expected to continue to be affected by changes in net cash farm income  farm land values  weather conditions  the demand for agricultural commodities  farm industry related legislation and general economic conditions 
industry conditions for retail sales of agricultural equipment are expected to be mixed in compared to in north america  despite the decline in commodity prices in the second half of  retail farm equipment demand is expected to remain stable in as farmers are expected to continue to invest in equipment resulting from high farm income generated in in addition  government farm support payments are expected to partially offset the impact of lower commodity prices 
in europe  industry retail demand is expected to be relatively flat as the benefits of a stronger harvest in is anticipated to be offset by lower commodity prices and the impact of the strong euro 
in south america  lower commodity prices  higher input costs and the weak dollar are expected to negatively impact farm income 
as a result  industry retail demand is expected to decline significantly in compared to the strong levels of based on this market outlook  net income is expected to remain relatively flat in compared to the impact of anticipated market declines in our profitable south america operations and higher investments in engineering expenses are expected to be offset by the benefits of improved productivity and other cost reduction and distribution initiatives 
in addition  the weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate earnings per share are expected to be higher to reflect additional common shares issued in march foreign currency risk management we have significant manufacturing operations in france  germany  brazil  finland and denmark  and we purchase a portion of our tractors  combines and components from third party foreign suppliers  primarily in various european countries and in japan 
we also sell products in over countries throughout the world 
the majority of our revenue outside the united states is denominated in the currency of the customer location  with the exception of sales in the middle east  africa and asia where revenue is primarily denominated in british pounds  euros or united states dollars 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for sales by customer location 
our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are the euro  brazilian real and the canadian dollar in relation to the united states dollar 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies create exposures  which can adversely affect our results of operations 
we attempt to manage our transactional foreign exchange exposure by hedging foreign currency cash flow forecasts and commitments arising from the settlement of receivables and payables and from future purchases and sales 
where naturally offsetting currency positions do not occur  we hedge certain  but not all  of our exposures through the use of foreign currency forward contracts 
our hedging policy prohibits foreign currency forward contracts for speculative trading purposes 
our translation exposure resulting from translating the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries into united states dollars is not hedged 
our most significant translation exposures are the euro and the brazilian real in relation to the united states dollar 
when practical  this translation impact is reduced by financing local operations with local borrowings 
all derivatives are recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
on the date a derivative contract is entered into  we designate the derivative as either a fair value hedge of a recognized liability  a cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction  a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation  or a non designated derivative instrument 
we currently engage in derivatives that are non designated derivative instruments 
changes in fair value of non designated derivative contracts are reported in current earnings 

table of contents the following is a summary of foreign currency forward contracts used to hedge currency exposures 
all contracts have a maturity of less than one year

interest rates we manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt and may in the future utilize interest rate swap contracts 
we have fixed rate debt from our senior notes  our senior subordinated notes and our convertible senior subordinated notes 
our floating rate exposure is related to our revolving credit facility and our securitization facilities  which are tied to changes in united states and european libor rates 
assuming a increase in interest rates  interest expense  net and the cost of our securitization facilities for the year ended december  would have increased by approximately million

among other provisions  the new rule requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal as stated in arb no 
additionally  sfas requires 
table of contents that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities

on october   the american jobs creation act of ajca was enacted 
the ajca provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities  which will be phased in from through the ajca also provides for a two year phase out of the existing extra territorial income exclusion eti for foreign sales that was viewed to be inconsistent with international trade protocols by the european union 
under the guidance in fasb staff position no 
 application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of  the deduction will be treated as a special deduction as described in sfas as such  the special deduction has no effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at the enactment date 
the ajca provides multi national companies an election to deduct from taxable income of eligible dividends repatriated from foreign subsidiaries 
eligible dividends generally cannot exceed million and must meet certain business purposes to qualify for the deduction 
in addition  there are provisions which prohibit the use of net operating losses to avoid a tax liability on the taxable portion of a qualifying dividend 
the estimated impact to current tax expense in the united states is generally equal to of the qualifying dividend 
the ajca generally allows companies to take advantage of this special deduction from november through the end of calendar year we did not propose a qualifying plan of repatriation for we are currently assessing whether we will propose a plan of qualifying repatriation in the estimated range of dividend amounts that we may consider would not exceed eligible dividend amounts allowable under the ajca 
during the fourth quarter of  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting issues related to certain features of contingently convertible debt and the effect on diluted earnings per share 
eitf issue no 
requires that shares subject to issuance from contingently convertible debt should be included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share using the if converted method regardless of whether a market price trigger has been met 
we adopted eitf during the fourth quarter of and have included approximately million additional shares of common stock that may be issued upon conversion of our outstanding convertible senior subordinated notes in our diluted earnings per share calculation for the year ended december  and million additional shares of common stock for the year ended december  in addition  diluted earnings per share is required to be restated for each period that the convertible debt was outstanding 
agco s convertible senior subordinated notes were issued on december  as we are not benefiting losses in the united states for tax purposes  the interest expense associated with the convertible senior subordinated notes included in the diluted earnings per share calculation does not reflect an income tax benefit 
a reconciliation of net income and weighted average common shares outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per share is presented in note to our consolidated financial statements

we are currently evaluating whether or not the benefits provided by our postretirement benefit plans are actuarially equivalent to medicare part d under the act 
decisions regarding the impact of the act on our plans will be addressed after the completion of that evaluation  but we currently do not expect the impact to be material
