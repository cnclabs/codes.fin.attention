table of contents operations of our business 
operating margin should be considered in addition to  rather than as a substitute for  pre tax income  net income and earnings per share 
qualified accounts all open client accounts with a total liquidation value greater than or equal to  except clearing accounts 
historically  qualified accounts have generated the vast majority of the company s revenues 
the company s normal account opening requirement for non ira accounts is  additionally  accounts with  or more of liquidation value are not subject to account maintenance fees and may be eligible for margin account approval 
segregated cash client cash and investments segregated in compliance with sec rule c the customer protection rule and other regulations 
interest earned on segregated cash is a component of net interest revenue 
total accounts all open client accounts funded and unfunded  except clearing accounts 
total trades all client securities trades  which are executed by the company s broker dealer subsidiaries on an agency basis 
total trades are the principal source of the company s revenues 
such trades include  but are not limited to  trades in equities  options  mutual funds and debt instruments 
substantially all trades generate revenue from commissions  transaction fees and or revenue sharing arrangements with market destinations also known as payment for order flow 
trading days days in which the us equity markets are open for a full trading session 
reduced exchange trading sessions are treated as half trading days 
overview we provide securities brokerage and clearing execution services to our clients through our principal retail and clearing broker dealer  ameritrade  inc substantially all of our net revenues are derived from our brokerage activities and clearing and execution services 
our primary focus is serving retail clients by providing services at low prices that are generally simpler than most of our competitors 
our brokerage clients are able to trade securities with us through a variety of channels  principally the internet 
we provide our clients with investment news and information as well as educational services 
we also provide clearing and execution services to our brokerage operations as well as to unaffiliated broker dealers 
our largest sources of revenue are commissions earned from our brokerage activities and associated securities transaction clearing fees 
our other principal source of revenue is net interest revenue 
we also receive payment for order flow  which results from arrangements we have with many execution agents to receive cash payments in exchange for routing trade orders to these firms for execution and is included in commissions and clearing fees on the consolidated statements of operations 
our largest operating expense generally is employee compensation and benefits 
employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries  bonuses  stock based compensation  group insurance  contributions to benefit programs  recruitment and other related employee costs 
clearing and execution costs include incremental third party expenses that tend to fluctuate as a result of fluctuations in client accounts or trades 
examples of expenses included in this category are statement and confirmation processing and postage costs and clearing expenses paid to the national securities clearing corporation  option exchanges and other market centers 
communications expense includes telecommunications  other postage  news and quote costs 
occupancy and equipment costs include the costs of leasing and maintaining our office spaces and the lease expenses on computer and other equipment 
depreciation and amortization includes depreciation on property and equipment  as well as amortization of intangible assets 
professional services expense includes costs paid to outside firms for assistance with legal  accounting  technology  marketing and general management issues 
interest on borrowings consists of interest expense on our prepaid variable forward contracts and other borrowings 
other operating expenses include provision for losses  client trade execution price adjustments  travel expenses and other miscellaneous expenses 
advertising costs are expensed as incurred and include production and placement of advertisements in various media  
table of contents including online  television  print and direct mail 
advertising expenses may increase or decrease significantly from period to period 
unrealized fair value adjustments of derivative instruments consist of changes in the fair value of the embedded collars within our knight prepaid variable forward contracts 
we believe that the online securities brokerage market is currently impacted by four significant industry trends that may affect our financial condition and results of operations 
first  price is an important component of the value proposition for the online securities brokerage market 
this trend has resulted in the implementation of various strategies such as tiered pricing  account maintenance fees  order handling fees and per share charges 
second  technology has increased in importance  as delivery channels such as the internet have become more prevalent 
the vast majority of our trades and a significant percentage of our client support activities are now placed through electronic media  primarily the internet 
this increased use of electronic media has helped to decrease operating expenses per trade over the past several years and we believe this trend will continue 
third  the increasing recognition of the need for scale and required investment in technology have resulted in consolidation in the industry 
finally  we believe the intense advertising and promotional efforts by our major competitors and us are making it increasingly difficult for new entrants to make a competitive impact without substantial financial resources to invest in building a brand 
our fiscal year ends on the last friday in september 
references to fiscal year in this document or in the information incorporated herein by reference are to the approximate twelve month period ended on any such friday 
for example  fiscal refers to the fiscal year ended september  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that may have a significant impact upon our financial results 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies  many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following areas are particularly subject to management s judgments and estimates and could materially affect our results of operations and financial position 
valuation of goodwill and acquired intangible assets we test goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis  or whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in performing the impairment tests  we utilize quoted market prices of our common stock to estimate the fair value of the company as a whole 
the estimated fair value is then allocated to our reporting units based on operating revenues  and is compared with the carrying value of the reporting units 
no impairment charges have resulted from our annual impairment tests 
we review our acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable 
we evaluate recoverability by comparing the undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset s carrying amount 
we also evaluate the remaining useful lives of intangible assets each reporting period to determine if events or trends warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
we have had no events or trends that have warranted a revision to the originally estimated useful lives 
valuation and accounting for derivative financial instruments we may utilize derivative financial instruments to manage risks such as interest rate risk  foreign currency risk or market risk 
our derivatives policy prohibits us from using derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 
accounting for derivatives differs significantly depending on whether a derivative is designated as a hedge  which is a transaction intended to reduce a risk associated with a specific balance sheet item or future expected cash flow at the time it is purchased 
in order to qualify as a hedge  a derivative must be designated as such by management  who must also continue to evaluate whether the instrument effectively reduces the risk associated with that item 

table of contents to determine if a derivative instrument continues to be an effective hedge  we must make assumptions and judgments about the continued effectiveness of our hedging strategies and the nature and timing of forecasted transactions 
if our hedging strategy were to become ineffective  we could no longer apply hedge accounting and our reported results of operations or financial condition could be materially affected 
for example  during fiscal  we entered into a series of prepaid variable forward contracts  which are described later in this item under the heading prepaid variable forward contracts 
we originally designated the forward contracts as cash flow hedges of the forecasted future sales of our investment in knight common stock 
accordingly  all changes in the fair value of the derivatives were recorded in other comprehensive income  net of income taxes 
on november   following discussions with the staff of the sec  the company concluded that its designation of the embedded collars within the forward contracts as cash flow hedges of the forecasted future sales of knight shares was not documented adequately at the inception of the contracts 
therefore  the embedded collars did not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment  and the consolidated financial statements were restated to reflect the embedded collars as non hedging derivatives 
estimates of effective income tax rates  deferred income taxes and valuation allowances we estimate our income tax expense based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our current income tax obligations and to assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
temporary differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
we must evaluate the likelihood that deferred income tax assets will be realized 
to the extent we determine that realization is not more likely than not  we establish a valuation allowance 
establishing or increasing a valuation allowance results in corresponding income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
conversely  to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary  that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed  reducing income tax expense 
we must make significant judgments to calculate our provision for income taxes  our deferred income tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets 
results of operations our results of operations are significantly impacted by conditions in the us equity markets 
there is a direct correlation between the volume of our clients trading activity and our results of operations 
we cannot predict future trading volumes in the us equity markets 
if client trading activity increases  we expect that it would have a positive impact on our results of operations 
if client trading activity were to decline  we expect that it would have a negative impact on our results of operations 
changes in short term interest rates and in client margin and client cash balances also impact our results of operations 
we cannot predict the direction of short term interest rates or the level of client margin and client cash balances 
if short term interest rates rise  we generally expect to earn a larger net interest spread 
conversely  a falling short term interest rate environment generally would result in our earning a smaller net interest spread 
financial performance metrics pre tax income  net income  earnings per share  operating margin and ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization are key metrics we use in evaluating our financial performance 
operating margin and ebitda are both considered non gaap financial measures as defined by sec regulation g 
we define operating margin as pre tax income  adjusted to remove advertising expense  unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments and any unusual gains or charges 
we consider operating margin an important measure of the financial performance of our ongoing business 
advertising spending is excluded because it is largely at the discretion of the company  varies significantly from period to period based on 
table of contents market conditions and relates to the acquisition of future revenues through new accounts rather than current revenues from existing accounts 
unusual gains and charges are excluded because we believe they are not likely to be indicative of the ongoing operations of our business 
operating margin should be considered in addition to  rather than as a substitute for  pre tax income  net income and earnings per share 
we consider ebitda an important measure of our financial performance and of our ability to generate cash flows to service debt  fund capital expenditures and fund other corporate investing and financing activities 
ebitda eliminates the non cash effect of tangible asset depreciation and intangible asset amortization 
ebitda should be considered in addition to  rather than as a substitute for  pre tax income  net income and cash flows from operating activities

operating margin operating margin less advertising gain loss on disposal of property unrealized fair value adjustments of derivative instruments restructuring and asset impairment charges pre tax income ebitda ebitda less depreciation and amortization interest on borrowings pre tax income our improved pre tax income  operating margin and ebitda for fiscal compared to fiscal are largely due to increased net interest revenue resulting primarily from increased client margin and credit balances and higher net interest rates earned on such balances  partially offset by decreased revenue from commissions and clearing fees resulting from decreased client trading activity and decreased commissions and clearing fees per trade 
more detailed analysis of net revenues and expenses is presented later in this discussion 
operating metrics our largest sources of revenue are commissions and clearing fees and net interest revenue 
for fiscal  commissions and clearing fees and net interest revenue accounted for percent and percent of our net revenues  respectively 
the primary factors driving our revenues from commissions and clearing fees are total client trades and average commissions and clearing fees per trade 
the primary factors driving our net interest revenue are average client margin balances  average segregated cash balances  average client credit balances and the average interest rates earned and paid on such balances 
we also consider client account and client asset metrics  although we believe they are generally of less significance to our results of operations for any particular period than our trading activity and net interest revenue metrics

change percentages are based on non rounded statements of operations amounts 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net revenues commissions and clearing fees decreased six percent  primarily due to a four percent decrease in total trades and a two percent decrease in average commissions and clearing fees per trade 
average trades per day decreased seven percent to  for fiscal from  for fiscal average client trades per account were during fiscal  compared to during fiscal the decreased revenue resulting 
table of contents from these factors was partially offset by three percent more trading days in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to fiscal being a week year 
the number of qualified accounts increased three percent to million as of september   compared to million as of september  historically  qualified accounts have generated the vast majority of our revenues 
average commissions and clearing fees per trade decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal  due primarily to a decrease in our options contract pricing and decreased payment for order flow revenue per trade 
in march  we lowered our options contract pricing from to per contract 
we expect average commissions and clearing fees to range from approximately to per trade during the first quarter of fiscal  depending on the mix of client trading activity  level of payment for order flow revenue and other factors 
we expect total revenues from commissions and clearing fees to range from million to million for the first quarter of fiscal  depending on the volume of client trading activity  average commissions and clearing fees per trade and other factors 
net interest revenue increased percent  due primarily to an increase of basis points in the average interest rate earned on segregated cash  an increase of basis points in the average interest rate charged on client margin balances  a nine percent increase in average client margin balances  seven more interest days due to fiscal being a week year and an million increase in net interest earned on our securities lending program in fiscal compared to fiscal the increased net interest revenue resulting from these factors was partially offset by an increase of basis points in the average interest rate paid on client credit balances in fiscal from fiscal we expect net interest revenue to range between million and million for the first quarter of fiscal other revenues decreased four percent  due primarily to a decrease in account maintenance  confirm and other fee revenue  partially offset by higher solicitation and tender offer fees and money market fee income 
account maintenance fees are charged based on client assets and trading activity  therefore fluctuations in client assets or trades per account may result in fluctuations in revenues from account maintenance fees 
we expect other revenues to range from million to million for the first quarter of fiscal expenses employee compensation and benefits expense increased percent  due primarily to an increase in full time equivalent employees to  at september  from  at september   increased incentive compensation due to improved financial results  annual merit increases and approximately million of severance costs for departing executives in the fourth quarter of fiscal we expect total employee compensation and benefits expense to range between million and million for the first quarter of fiscal clearing and execution costs decreased percent  due primarily to lower client trading volumes  decreased order routing costs resulting from our implementation of a single web architecture trading platform during fiscal and a non recurring refund of nasdaq trading activity fees of approximately million during the first quarter of fiscal we expect clearing and execution costs to range between million and million for the first quarter of fiscal  depending largely on the volume of client trading activity 
communications expense decreased percent  due primarily to reduced telecommunications costs resulting from contract negotiations in fiscal we expect communications expense to range between million and million for the first quarter of fiscal occupancy and equipment costs increased two percent  due primarily to costs associated with moving technology employees to a larger facility in new jersey during the third quarter of fiscal  partially offset by slightly lower computer equipment leasing costs 
we expect occupancy and equipment costs to range from approximately million to million for the first quarter of fiscal depreciation and amortization increased five percent  due primarily to higher intangible asset amortization in fiscal we expect depreciation and amortization expense to range from million to million for the first quarter of fiscal 
table of contents professional services expense increased percent  due primarily to increased spending on corporate development initiatives in fiscal and increased legal fees incurred for regulatory matters  partially offset by decreased client communications consulting expenses 
we expect professional services expense to range between million and million for the first quarter of fiscal other operating expenses increased percent  due primarily to increased bad debt expense during fiscal and the effect of datek related litigation and arbitration matters that were resolved favorably during the fourth quarter of fiscal we expect other operating expenses to range between million and million for the first quarter of fiscal advertising expenses decreased eight percent  as we reduced expenditures in response to lackluster stock market conditions 
we expect approximately million to million of advertising expenditures for the first quarter of fiscal  depending on market conditions 
we generally adjust our level of advertising spending in relation to stock market activity  in an effort to maximize the number of new accounts while minimizing the advertising cost per new account 
unrealized fair value adjustments of derivative instruments consisted of an million unrealized gain for fiscal compared to a million unrealized gain for fiscal  due to decreases in the market price of the knight stock underlying our prepaid variable forward contracts in both fiscal and fiscal because the embedded collars within the prepaid variable forward contracts are accounted for as non hedging derivatives  changes in the fair value of the embedded collars are recognized in the statement of operations  along with the related income tax effects 
accounting for the embedded collars as non hedging derivatives results in volatility in our results of operations  as fluctuations in the market price of the underlying knight shares result in changes in the fair value of the embedded collars being recorded in the statement of operations 
we cannot predict changes in the market price of the knight stock  and accordingly cannot predict future unrealized fair value adjustments of the embedded collars 
we are evaluating alternatives with respect to the knight investment  including  but not limited to  terminating the prepaid variable forward contracts and liquidating the investment in knight 
our effective income tax rate was approximately percent for fiscal compared to percent for fiscal the datek integration has resulted in a larger percentage of our payroll and assets being located in lower income tax states 
an adjustment to our net deferred income tax liabilities to apply the lower income tax rate resulted in a lower than normal effective income tax rate for fiscal we expect our effective income tax rate to range from approximately percent to percent for the first quarter of fiscal fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net revenues commissions and clearing fees increased percent  primarily due to higher average client trades per day and increased average commissions and clearing fees per trade 
average trades per day increased percent to  for fiscal from  in fiscal average client trades per account were during fiscal  compared to during fiscal  while the number of qualified accounts increased percent to million as of september   compared to million as of september  historically  qualified accounts have generated the vast majority of our revenues 
average commissions and clearing fees per trade increased to for fiscal from for fiscal  due primarily to higher payment for order flow revenue per trade during fiscal compared to fiscal net interest revenue increased percent  due primarily to a percent increase in average client margin balances  a percent increase in average segregated cash and a decrease of eight basis points in the average interest rate paid on client credit balances during fiscal compared to fiscal the increased net interest revenue resulting from these factors was partially offset by a decrease of basis points in the average interest rate earned on segregated cash  a decrease of basis points in the average interest rate charged on client margin balances and an increase of percent in client credit balances during fiscal as compared to fiscal 
table of contents other revenues decreased seven percent  due primarily to lower account maintenance fee income in fiscal and decreased licensing fee revenue due to the shutdown of our watcher technologies business in fiscal  partially offset by higher money market fee income during fiscal expenses employee compensation and benefits expense decreased percent  due primarily to the elimination of duplicate clearing and technology functions during fiscal in connection with the datek merger integration  partially offset by client service employees added during fiscal to accommodate increased client trading volume 
full time equivalent employees totaled  at september   compared to  at the end of fiscal during fiscal  we also incurred approximately million of expense for bonuses based on synergies achieved in the datek merger and approximately million of compensation expense for stock appreciation rights sars assumed in the datek merger  due to increases in our stock price and costs of a cash out offer to sar holders 
as of september   there were approximately  remaining sars outstanding  compared with approximately million sars outstanding at the beginning of fiscal clearing and execution costs decreased percent  due primarily to approximately million in refunds and adjustments in the second quarter of fiscal for clearing and execution costs related to previous periods and the effect of eliminating duplicate clearing and execution costs subsequent to the datek merger in fiscal  partially offset by the effect of higher client trading volumes 
communications expense decreased four percent  due primarily to the elimination of duplicate telecommunications  quotes and market information infrastructure subsequent to the datek merger in fiscal  partially offset by the effect of higher client trading volumes 
occupancy and equipment costs decreased percent  due to facilities and equipment reductions during fiscal resulting from the datek merger and lower technology licensing costs 
depreciation and amortization decreased percent  due primarily to the effects of noncompete agreements related to the datek merger that expired and became fully amortized by the end of fiscal and tangible assets that became fully depreciated 
professional services expense decreased percent  primarily due to increased usage of consulting services during fiscal in connection with the datek merger integration 
interest on borrowings decreased percent  primarily due to the redemption of our remaining convertible subordinated notes in october gain loss on disposal of property includes approximately million of gain recognized on the sale leaseback of our kansas city data center facility in fiscal other operating expenses decreased percent  due primarily to datek related litigation and arbitration matters that were resolved favorably during the fourth quarter of fiscal advertising expenses increased percent 
we increased our advertising spending during fiscal in an effort to increase the number of new accounts  due primarily to improved stock market conditions during fiscal unrealized fair value adjustments of derivative instruments consisted of a million unrealized gain for fiscal compared to a million unrealized loss for fiscal  due to decreases in the market price of the knight stock underlying our prepaid variable forward contracts in fiscal compared to increases in the market price of the knight stock in fiscal restructuring and asset impairment charges in fiscal consisted of approximately million in severance costs related to the closing of our tradecast business and the integration of the datek and ameritrade technology organizations  and approximately million of non cancelable lease costs in connection with the closing of tradecast 

table of contents our effective income tax rate was approximately percent for fiscal  compared to approximately percent for fiscal the datek integration has resulted in a larger percentage of our payroll and assets being located in lower income tax states 
an adjustment to our net deferred income tax liabilities to apply the lower rate resulted in a lower than normal effective income tax rate for fiscal liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our liquidity and capital needs primarily through the use of funds generated from operations and from borrowings under our credit agreements 
we have also issued common stock and convertible subordinated notes to finance mergers and acquisitions and for other corporate purposes 
our liquidity needs during fiscal were financed from our earnings  cash on hand and borrowings on our broker dealer credit facilities 
we plan to finance our ordinary capital and liquidity needs primarily from our earnings and cash on hand 
in addition  we may utilize our revolving credit facility or issue equity or debt securities 
to complete our planned acquisition of the us brokerage business of td waterhouse group  inc td waterhouse  we plan to issue million shares of common stock  subject to regulatory and stockholder approvals 
we also expect to declare a per share special cash dividend  subject to closing of the acquisition 
we expect to fund the approximately billion special dividend with approximately billion from cash on hand  approximately billion from excess capital in td waterhouse at closing and the remaining billion by issuing private long term debt 
we also intend to issue another million of private long term debt  and enter into a million revolving credit agreement  for working capital purposes 
although we believe we will be able to obtain adequate financing for the special dividend and our working capital needs  there can be no assurance that financing will be available on terms favorable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  we would be unable to declare the special dividend and complete the acquisition 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information about the td waterhouse acquisition 
dividends from our subsidiaries are another source of liquidity for the holding company 
some of our subsidiaries are subject to requirements of the sec and nasd relating to liquidity  capital standards  and the use of client funds and securities  which may limit funds available for the payment of dividends to the holding company 
under the sec s uniform net capital rule rule c under the securities exchange act of  our broker dealer subsidiaries are required to maintain at all times at least the minimum level of net capital required under rule c this minimum net capital level is determined based upon an involved calculation described in rule c that is primarily based on each broker dealer s aggregate debits  which primarily are a function of client margin balances at our broker dealer subsidiaries 
since our aggregate debits may fluctuate significantly  our minimum net capital requirements may also fluctuate significantly from period to period 
the holding company may make cash capital contributions to broker dealer subsidiaries  if necessary  to meet net capital requirements 

table of contents liquid assets we consider liquid assets an important measure of our liquidity and of our ability to fund corporate investing and financing activities 
liquid assets is considered a non gaap financial measure as defined by the sec 
we define liquid assets as the sum of a non broker dealer cash and cash equivalents  b non broker dealer short term investments and c regulatory net capital of our broker dealer subsidiaries in excess of of aggregate debit items 
we include the excess regulatory net capital of our broker dealer subsidiaries in liquid assets rather than simply including broker dealer cash and cash equivalents  because regulatory net capital requirements may limit the amount of cash available for dividend from the broker dealer subsidiaries to the holding company 
liquid assets should be considered as a supplemental measure of liquidity  rather than as a substitute for cash and cash equivalents 
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents to liquid assets for the periods indicated in thousands september  september  change cash and cash equivalents less broker dealer cash and cash equivalents non broker dealer cash and cash equivalents plus non broker dealer short term investments plus excess broker dealer regulatory net capital liquid assets includes the impact of a regulatory matter related to an fdic insured deposit sweep program as of september  excluding the impact of the regulatory matter  excess broker dealer regulatory net capital would be approximately million and liquid assets would be approximately million as of september  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the regulatory matter 
the increase in liquid assets from september  to september  is primarily due to the impact of curing the fdic insured deposit sweep program regulatory matter of million and net income of million  partially offset by an increase in aggregate debit items that resulted in increased regulatory net capital required of million  cash used in investing and financing activities  excluding short term investments  of million see cash flow below and the impact of a net capital calculation issue discussed in the following paragraph of million 
the remaining million of the increase in liquid assets is due to increased non broker dealer working capital due to timing of income tax and other payments  non cash gains and expenses that are reflected in net income  and other miscellaneous changes in excess regulatory net capital 
we have retained a larger portion of our liquid assets during fiscal than during fiscal we intend to use the liquid assets retained to provide funding for a portion of the proposed special dividend 
the nasd and sec have inquired about the effect on ameritrade  inc s net capital of certain deferred income tax liabilities arising from acquisitions 
the issue is whether deferred tax liabilities may offset the acquired intangible client relationship assets to which they relate before the acquired intangible client relationship assets  which are not allowable assets for regulatory net capital purposes  are deducted in the net capital calculation 
for purposes of calculating net capital  the sec has allowed ameritrade  inc to offset the acquired intangible client relationship asset related to the datek acquisition with its associated deferred tax liability 
the datek transaction was not a taxable asset purchase 
however  deferred tax liabilities totaling million for acquired intangible assets related to taxable asset purchases are excluded from ameritrade  inc s net capital calculation as of september  cash flow cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the slight increase was primarily due to higher net income in fiscal  partially offset by changes in broker dealer working capital 

table of contents cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the cash used in investing activities in fiscal consisted primarily of million of net short term investments in auction rate securities and million paid in the acquisition of the online retail client accounts of jb oxford company 
the cash used in investing activities for fiscal consisted primarily of million paid in the acquisition of bidwell company and two small account acquisition transactions and million of net short term investments in auction rate securities 
cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the financing activities in fiscal included million of stock repurchases  compared to million of stock repurchases and an early redemption of convertible subordinated notes for million during fiscal we made fewer stock repurchases during fiscal  in part to retain cash in anticipation of funding a portion of the proposed special dividend 
our broker dealer subsidiary  ameritrade  inc  also borrowed and subsequently repaid million on its unsecured credit facilities during the first quarter of fiscal to cure the asserted exchange act rule c deficiency described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  we borrowed and repaid million on our revolving credit agreement and million on ameritrade northwest  inc s formerly bidwell secured credit facility to fund daily liquidity needs 
loan facilities on december   we entered into an amendment to our revolving credit agreement 
the revolving credit agreement  as amended  permits borrowings of up to million through december   and is secured primarily by our stock in our subsidiaries and personal property 
the interest rate on borrowings is equal to one month libor determined monthly plus a spread determined quarterly of percent or percent based on a specified financial ratio 
at september   the interest rate on the revolving credit agreement would have been percent 
we also pay a commitment fee of percent of the unused credit facility through the maturity date 
we had no outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit agreement at september  and no outstanding indebtedness under the prior revolving credit agreement at september  the revolving credit agreement contains certain covenants and restrictions  including maintenance of a minimum level of net worth  requiring prior written consent of the revolving lenders for certain business combinations and investments  and prohibiting the payment of cash dividends to stockholders 
we were in compliance with or obtained waivers for all covenants under the revolving credit agreements 
on december   the lenders under our revolving credit agreement agreed to extend the length of the agreement  on substantially the same terms  to the earlier of a march  or b the initial borrowing under a new syndicated loan facility to be entered into in connection with the acquisition of td waterhouse and payment of the special dividend 
our wholly owned broker dealer subsidiary  ameritrade  inc  had access to secured uncommitted credit facilities with financial institutions of up to million as of september  and september  ameritrade  inc also had access to an unsecured uncommitted credit facility of up to million as of september  and september  the financial institutions may make loans under line of credit arrangements or  in some cases  issue letters of credit under these facilities 
the secured credit facilities require ameritrade  inc to pledge qualified client securities to secure outstanding obligations under these facilities 
borrowings under the secured and unsecured credit facilities bear interest at a variable rate based on the federal funds rate 
there were no borrowings outstanding or letters of credit issued under the secured or unsecured credit facilities as of september  or september  as of september  and september   approximately million was available to ameritrade  inc for either loans or  in some cases  letters of credit 
prepaid variable forward contracts during fiscal  we entered into a series of prepaid variable forward contracts the forward contracts with a counterparty with a total notional amount of approximately million on million underlying knight shares 
the forward contracts each contain a zero cost embedded collar on the value of the 
table of contents knight shares  with a weighted average floor price of per share and a weighted average cap price of per share 
at the inception of the forward contracts  we received cash of approximately million  equal to approximately percent of the notional amount 
the forward contracts mature on various dates in fiscal years and at maturity  we may settle the forward contracts in shares of knight or in cash  at our option 
if the market price of the knight stock at maturity is equal to or less than the floor price  the counterparty will be entitled to receive one share of knight or its cash equivalent for each underlying share 
if the market price of the knight stock at maturity is greater than the cap price  the counterparty will be entitled to receive the number of shares of knight or its cash equivalent equal to the ratio of the floor price plus the excess of the market price over the cap price  divided by the market price  for each underlying share 
if the market price at maturity is greater than the floor price but less than or equal to the cap price  the counterparty will be entitled to receive the number of knight shares or its cash equivalent equal to the ratio of the floor price divided by the market price for each underlying share 
regardless of whether the forward contract is settled in knight shares or in cash  we intend to sell the underlying knight shares at maturity 
the embedded collars do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  and are therefore accounted for as non hedging derivatives in the consolidated financial statements 
as of september  and september   the total fair value of the embedded collars was approximately million and million  respectively  and was included under the caption prepaid variable forward derivative instrument on the consolidated balance sheets 
changes in the fair value of the embedded collars are included under the caption unrealized fair value adjustments of derivative instruments in the consolidated statements of operations 
the million of cash received on the forward contracts is accounted for as an obligation on the consolidated balance sheets 
we are accreting interest on the obligation to the notional maturity amount of million over the terms of the forward contracts using effective interest rates with a weighted average of approximately percent 
upon settlement of a forward contract  the realized gain or loss on the knight stock delivered to the counterparty or otherwise sold will be reclassified from other comprehensive income into earnings 
we are evaluating alternatives with respect to the knight investment  including  but not limited to  terminating the prepaid variable forward contracts and liquidating the investment in knight 
stock repurchase program on september   our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million shares of our common stock from time to time over a two year period beginning september  on may   our board of directors extended the stock repurchase program through may  under the stock repurchase program  as extended  we may repurchase  from time to time  up to million shares of our common stock  a million share increase from the previous authorization 
through september   we have repurchased a total of approximately million shares at a weighted average purchase price of per share 
during the first six months of fiscal  we repurchased approximately million shares at a weighted average purchase price of per share 
we did not make any repurchases under the program during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  and do not expect to make any repurchases during the first quarter of fiscal off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any obligations that meet the definition of an off balance sheet arrangement and have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial statements 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of september  amounts are in thousands 
payments due by period fiscal years less than more than year years years years contractual obligations total after long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations deferred compensation prepaid variable forward contract obligation total our obligation to our ceo for deferred compensation will become payable not sooner than the day after the ceo s employment with the company terminates 
the obligation is presented in the fiscal column as the entire amount of the compensation has already been earned by the ceo 
represents the notional amount of the prepaid variable forward contracts 
the actual amount of the obligation is dependent on the market value of the underlying knight shares at maturity of the contracts and may be settled in knight shares or cash  at our option 
new accounting pronouncements sfas no 
r in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment no 
r 
sfas no 
r is a revision of sfas no 
 and supersedes apb no 
and its related implementation guidance 
sfas no 
r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
sfas no 
r requires public entities to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
sfas no 
r was originally scheduled to be effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  for public entities that do not file as small business issuers 
on april   the sec announced the adoption of a new rule amending the compliance date to the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after june  for public entities that do not file as small business issuers 
therefore  sfas no 
r will be effective for our next fiscal year beginning october  as of the required effective date  we will apply sfas no 
r using a modified version of the prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under sfas no 
for either recognition or pro forma disclosures 
the company estimates adoption of sfas no 
r will result in additional stock based compensation expense for the unvested portion of awards previously accounted for under apb no 
of approximately million for the company s fiscal year ending september  
table of contents risk factors stock market volatility and other securities industry risks could adversely affect our business 
substantially all of our revenues are derived from securities brokerage and clearing and execution services 
like other securities brokerage businesses  we are directly affected by economic and political conditions  broad trends in business and finance and changes in volume and price levels of securities transactions 
since may  the us securities markets have been very volatile  which has resulted in volatility in trading volume and net revenues 
the terrorist attacks in the united states on september   the invasion of iraq in and other events also resulted in substantial market volatility and accompanying reductions in trading volume and net revenues 
in addition  any general economic downturn would adversely affect trading volumes and net revenues 
severe market fluctuations or weak economic conditions could reduce our trading volume and net revenues and adversely affect our profitability 
we have exposure to interest rate risk 
as a fundamental part of our brokerage business  we hold interest earning assets  mainly funds required to be segregated in compliance with federal regulations 
these funds totaled billion at september  and billion at september  we invest these funds in repurchase agreements  fixed rate us treasury securities and other qualified securities 
our interest earning assets are financed primarily by short term interest bearing liabilities  totaling billion at september  and september   in the form of client credit balances 
we earn a net interest spread on the difference between amounts earned on client margin balances and amounts paid on client credit balances 
because we establish the rate paid on client credit balances and the rate charged on client margin balances  a substantial portion of our interest rate risk is under our direct management 
however  changes in interest rates may have a beneficial or adverse affect on our results of operations 
we might not change interest rates paid on client credit balances proportionately to changes in interest rates charged on client margin balances 
as a result  a rising interest rate environment generally results in our earning a larger net interest spread 
conversely  a falling interest rate environment generally results in our earning a smaller net interest spread 
the market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly 
our common stock  and the us securities markets in general  have experienced significant price fluctuations in recent years 
the market prices of securities of internet related companies  in particular  have been especially volatile 
the price of our common stock could decrease substantially 
in addition  because the market price of our common stock tends to fluctuate significantly  we could become the object of securities class action litigation which could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
substantial competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 
the market for electronic brokerage services is relatively young  continually evolving and intensely competitive 
we expect the competitive environment to continue in the future 
we face direct competition from numerous online brokerage firms  including charles schwab co  inc  e trade financial corporation  fidelity investments and scottrade  inc we also encounter competition from the broker dealer affiliates of established full commission brokerage firms as well as from financial institutions  mutual fund sponsors and other organizations  some of which provide online brokerage services 
some of our competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  offer a wider range of services and financial products  and have greater name recognition and a more extensive client base than we do 
we believe that the general financial success of companies within the online securities industry will continue to attract new competitors to the industry  such as banks  software development companies  insurance companies  providers of online financial information and others 
these companies may provide a more comprehensive suite of services than we do 
we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors 

table of contents systems failures and delays could harm our business 
we receive and process trade orders through a variety of electronic channels  including the internet  wireless web  personal digital assistants and our interactive voice response system 
these methods of trading are heavily dependent on the integrity of the electronic systems supporting them 
our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error  natural disasters  power loss  computer viruses  distributed denial of service ddos attacks  spurious spam attacks  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events 
though all of our core computer systems and applications are fully redundant and distributed over two sites  it could take up to four hours or more to restore full functionality in the event of an unforeseen disaster 
extraordinary trading volumes could cause our computer systems to operate at an unacceptably low speed or even fail 
extraordinary internet traffic caused by ddos or spam attacks could cause our web site to be unavailable or slow to respond 
while we have invested significant amounts in the last few years to upgrade the reliability and scalability of our systems and added hardware to address extraordinary internet traffic  there can be no assurance that our systems will be sufficient to handle such extraordinary circumstances 
systems failures and delays could occur and could cause  among other things  unanticipated disruptions in service to our clients  slower system response time resulting in transactions not being processed as quickly as our clients desire  decreased levels of client service and client satisfaction  and harm to our reputation 
if any of these events were to occur  we could suffer a loss of clients or a reduction in the growth of our client base  increased operating expenses  financial losses  additional litigation or other client claims  and regulatory sanctions or additional regulatory burdens 
our networks could be vulnerable to security risks 
the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks is a critical element of our operations 
we have not experienced network security problems in the past that have resulted in significant loss to our clients 
however  our networks could be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer viruses  phishing schemes and other security problems 
persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully use our confidential information or our clients confidential information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations 
we could be required to expend significant additional resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breaches 
we may not be able to implement security measures that will protect against all security risks 
capacity constraints of our systems could harm our business 
if our business increases  we may need to expand and upgrade our transaction processing systems  network infrastructure and other aspects of our technology 
many of our systems are  and much of our infrastructure is  designed to accommodate additional growth without redesign or replacement  however  we may need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate growth 
we may not be able to project accurately the rate  timing or cost of any increases in our business  or to expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate any increases in a timely manner 
failure to make necessary expansions and upgrades to our systems and infrastructure could lead to failures and delays  which could cause a loss of clients or a reduction in the growth of the client base  increased operating expenses  financial losses  additional litigation or client claims  and regulatory sanctions or additional regulatory burdens 
regulatory and legal uncertainties could harm our business 
the securities industry is subject to extensive regulation and broker dealers are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business 
the sec  nasd and other self regulatory organizations and 
table of contents state and foreign regulators can  among other things  censure  fine  issue cease and desist orders to  suspend or expel a broker dealer or any of its officers or employees 
while we neither actively solicit new accounts nor have established offices outside the united states and canada  our websites are accessible world wide over the internet and we currently have account holders located outside the united states and canada 
these accounts make up approximately of our accounts and are spread across many jurisdictions 
any adverse action by foreign regulators with respect to regulatory compliance by us in foreign jurisdictions could adversely affect our revenues from clients in such country or region 
various regulatory and enforcement agencies have been reviewing mutual fund trading  regulatory reporting obligations  best execution practices  client privacy  system security and safeguarding practices  regulation t compliance and advertising claims as they relate to the brokerage industry 
these reviews could result in enforcement actions or new regulations  which could adversely affect our operations 
in addition  we use the internet as a major distribution channel to provide services to our clients 
a number of regulatory agencies have adopted regulations regarding client privacy  system security and safeguarding practices and the use of client information by service providers 
additional laws and regulations relating to the internet and safeguarding practices could be adopted in the future  including laws related to identity theft and regulations regarding the pricing  taxation  content and quality of products and services delivered over the internet 
complying with these laws and regulations is expensive and time consuming and could limit our ability to use the internet as a distribution channel 
the success of our business will depend on continued development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure 
the internet has experienced  and is expected to continue to experience  significant growth in the number of users and amount of traffic 
our success will depend upon the development and maintenance of the internet s infrastructure to cope with this increased traffic 
the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure and could face similar outages and delays in the future 
outages and delays are likely to affect the level of internet usage and the processing of transactions on our web site 
in addition  the internet could lose its viability due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards to handle increased levels of activity 
our principal stockholders are parties to a stockholders agreement  which could limit the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters 
as of november   j 
joe ricketts  our chairman and founder  members of his family and trusts held for their benefit collectively  the ricketts holders owned approximately of our common stock and investment funds affiliated with silver lake partners and ta associates collectively  the datek holders owned approximately of our common stock 
the datek holders and the ricketts holders are parties to a stockholders agreement  which terminates on the earlier of the closing of the proposed acquisition of td waterhouse or one day after our annual meeting of stockholders in  that obligates the parties to vote their shares in favor of a board of directors  of which currently three are to be designated by the ricketts holders  two are to be designated by the datek holders and three are to be independent directors selected with the agreement of the parties 
the agreement also obligates the parties to vote in favor of specified merger and sale of the company transactions that are approved by the requisite directors and to vote against specified merger and sale of the company transactions unless they are approved by the requisite directors 
accordingly  these stockholders have significant influence over the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matters submitted to our stockholders for approval  including the election of directors  mergers  consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
the interests of these stockholders could differ from the interests of other stockholders 
in addition  third parties could be discouraged from making a tender offer or bid to acquire us because of this concentration of ownership or the provisions of the stockholders agreement 

table of contents the terms of the stockholders agreement  our charter documents and delaware law could inhibit a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable 
provisions in the stockholders agreement among the ricketts holders and the datek holders  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law will make it difficult for any party to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by the requisite number of directors 
these provisions include the presence of a classified board of directors  the ability of the board of directors to issue and determine the terms of preferred stock  advance notice requirements for inclusion of stockholder proposals at stockholder meetings  and the anti takeover provisions of delaware law 
these provisions could delay or prevent a change of control or change in management that might provide stockholders with a premium to the market price of their common stock 
we will need to introduce new products and services to remain competitive 
our future success depends in part on our ability to develop and enhance our products and services 
there are significant technical and financial risks in the development of new or enhanced products and services  including the risk that we might be unable to effectively use new technologies or adapt our services to emerging industry standards  or develop  introduce and market enhanced or new products and services 
in addition  the adoption of new internet  networking or telecommunications technologies or other technological changes could require us to incur substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our services or infrastructure 
changes in payments for routing our clients orders could adversely affect our business 
we have arrangements with several execution agents to receive cash payments in exchange for routing trade orders to these firms for execution 
competition between execution agents and the implementation of order handling rules and decimalization of stock prices have made it less profitable for execution agents to offer order flow payments to broker dealers 
on a per trade basis  our payment for order flow revenue has decreased significantly over the past several years 
these payments could continue to decrease on a per trade basis  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
the sec currently is inquiring into brokerage industry trade execution practices at the market open  including any related payment for order flow 
the sec could take action to prohibit payment for order flow  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
failure to comply with net capital requirements could adversely affect our business 
the sec  nasd and various other regulatory agencies have stringent rules with respect to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital by securities broker dealers 
net capital is a measure  defined by the sec  of a broker dealer s readily available liquid assets  reduced by its total liabilities other than approved subordinated debt 
all of our broker dealer subsidiaries are required to comply with the net capital requirements 
if we fail to maintain the required net capital  the sec could suspend or revoke our registration  or nasd could expel us from membership  which could ultimately lead to our liquidation  or they could impose censures  fines or other sanctions 
if the net capital rules are changed or expanded  or if there is an unusually large charge against net capital  operations that require the intensive use of capital would be limited 
a large operating loss or charge against net capital could adversely affect our ability to maintain or expand our business 
for example  on november   our broker dealer subsidiary ameritrade  inc was notified by the staff of the nasd and the staff of the sec division of market regulation collectively the staffs that in their view ameritrade  inc s net capital was below its minimum amount required under exchange act rule c the asserted deficiency was based upon the staffs concerns regarding a federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insured deposit sweep program available to ameritrade  inc s clients 
ameritrade  inc 
cured the asserted deficiency the next business day  november  on november   the nasd advised us that nasd staff has made a preliminary determination to recommend 
table of contents disciplinary action against the company based on allegations that it violated sec net capital and customer protection rules and nasd conduct rules 
we intend to submit a response setting forth the reasons we believe that nasd should not bring a disciplinary action 
if nasd elects to do so  it may seek censures  fines  suspensions or other sanctions 
we are unable to predict the outcome of this matter 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this matter 
our clearing operations expose us to liability for errors in clearing functions 
ameritrade  inc provides clearing and execution services to each of our brokerage businesses  as well as to independent broker dealers  depository institutions  registered investment advisors and financial planners 
clearing and execution services include the confirmation  receipt  settlement and delivery functions involved in securities transactions 
clearing brokers also assume direct responsibility for the possession and control of client securities and other assets and the clearance of client securities transactions 
self clearing securities firms are subject to substantially more regulatory control and examination than brokers that rely on others to perform those functions 
errors in performing clearing functions  including clerical and other errors related to the handling of funds and securities held by us on behalf of clients and introducing brokers  could lead to civil penalties imposed by applicable authorities as well as losses and liability in related lawsuits brought by clients and others 
we are exposed to credit risk with clients and counterparties 
we make margin loans to clients collateralized by client securities and periodically borrow and lend securities to cover trades 
a significant portion of our net revenues is derived from interest on margin loans 
by permitting clients to purchase securities on margin  we are subject to risks inherent in extending credit  especially during periods of rapidly declining markets in which the value of the collateral held by us could fall below the amount of a client s indebtedness 
to the extent that these margin loans exceed client cash balances maintained with us  we must obtain financing from third parties 
we may not be able to obtain this financing on favorable terms or in sufficient amounts 
in addition  in accordance with regulatory guidelines  we collateralize borrowings of securities by depositing cash or securities with lenders 
sharp changes in market values of substantial amounts of securities and the failure by parties to the borrowing transactions to honor their commitments could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
acquisitions involve risks that could adversely affect our business 
we intend to pursue strategic acquisitions of businesses and technologies 
acquisitions may entail numerous risks  including difficulties in the integration of acquired operations  services and products  failure to achieve expected synergies  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  assumption of unknown material liabilities of acquired companies  amortization of acquired intangible assets  which could reduce future reported earnings  potential loss of clients or key employees of acquired companies  and dilution to existing stockholders 
as part of our growth strategy  we regularly consider  and from time to time engage in  discussions and negotiations regarding strategic transactions such as acquisitions  mergers and combinations within our industry 
the purchase price for possible acquisitions could be paid in cash  through the issuance of common stock or other of our securities  borrowings or a combination of these methods 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to identify and to consummate strategic transactions and no assurance can be given with respect to the timing  likelihood or business effect of any possible transaction 
for example  in many cases we begin negotiations that we subsequently decide to suspend 
table of contents or terminate for a variety of reasons 
however  opportunities may arise from time to time that we will evaluate 
any transactions that we consummate would involve risks and uncertainties to us 
these risks could cause the failure of any anticipated benefits of an acquisition to be realized  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
see risk factors relating to the proposed acquisition of td waterhouse below for risk factors specific to our proposed acquisition of td waterhouse 
failure to maintain adequate internal controls could adversely affect our business 
we are subject to internal control requirements under the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as rules and regulations adopted by the sec and the public company accounting oversight board 
these laws  rules and regulations continue to evolve and could become increasingly stringent in the future 
we have undertaken actions to enhance our ability to comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of  including  but not limited to  the increased allocation of internal audit department resources  documentation of existing controls and implementation of new controls or modification of existing controls as deemed appropriate 
control deficiencies have been identified from time to time and we have undertaken actions to remediate them 
on november   our broker dealer subsidiary ameritrade  inc was notified by the staff of the nasd and the staff of the sec division of market regulation collectively the staffs that they believe that for regulatory purposes certain funds held in banks on behalf of clients are liabilities and assets of ameritrade  inc rather than liabilities and assets only of the banks 
the resulting assets have not been allowed for purposes of ameritrade  inc s regulatory net capital calculation 
accordingly  in the staffs view ameritrade  inc s net capital was below its minimum amount required under exchange act rule c our independent registered public accounting firm concluded that the controls in place relating to the matter were not properly designed to provide reasonable assurance that these funds were properly recorded and disclosed in the financial statements and assets were appropriately considered in regulatory net capital computations 
in their judgment  this was a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this regulatory matter 
during  we had discussions with the staff of the sec regarding our accounting for and disclosure of our prepaid variable forward contracts on our knight shares 
as a result of these discussions  on november   we concluded that our designation of the embedded collars within the forward contracts as cash flow hedges of the forecasted future sales of knight shares was not documented adequately at the inception of the contracts 
therefore  the embedded collars did not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment  and we restated our consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of operations  consolidated statements of stockholders equity  consolidated statements of cash flows and notes to consolidated financial statements to account for the embedded collars as non hedging derivatives 
management concluded that the controls in place relating to hedging documentation were not properly designed to provide reasonable assurance that these derivative instruments would be properly recorded and disclosed in the financial statements  and that this is a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting 
we continue to devote substantial time and resources to the documentation and testing of our controls  and to planning for and implementation of remedial efforts in those instances where remediation is indicated 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  as such standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  we could be subject to regulatory actions  civil or criminal penalties or shareholder litigation 
in addition  failure to maintain adequate internal controls could result in financial statements that do not accurately reflect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
risk factors relating to the proposed acquisition of td waterhouse we have entered into an agreement to acquire the us retail securities brokerage business of td waterhouse group  inc from the toronto dominion bank td 
the closing of the transaction  which is expected to occur on or around january   is subject to certain conditions including stockholder approval  regulatory approvals  the availability of financing to fund the per share special 
table of contents dividend to stockholders  and other conditions 
the following risk factors relate to the proposed acquisition of td waterhouse and the special dividend 
although we expect that the acquisition of td waterhouse will result in benefits to ameritrade  the combined company may not realize those benefits because of integration difficulties and other challenges 
the failure of the combined company  which will be renamed td ameritrade holding corporation td ameritrade  to meet the challenges involved in integrating the operations of ameritrade and td waterhouse successfully or otherwise to realize any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of td waterhouse  including anticipated cost savings and additional revenue opportunities  could seriously harm the results of operations of the combined company 
realizing the benefits of the acquisition of td waterhouse will depend in part on the integration of technology  operations and personnel 
the integration of the companies is a complex  time consuming and expensive process that  without proper planning and effective and timely implementation  could significantly disrupt the businesses of ameritrade and td waterhouse 
the challenges involved in this integration include the following demonstrating to the clients of ameritrade and to the clients of td waterhouse that the acquisition of td waterhouse will not result in adverse changes in client service standards or business focus and helping clients conduct business easily with the combined company  consolidating and rationalizing technology platforms and administrative infrastructures  combining product offerings  coordinating sales and marketing efforts to effectively communicate the capabilities of the combined company  integrating and rationalizing settlement and account and order management systems  preserving marketing and other important relationships of both ameritrade and td waterhouse and resolving potential conflicts that may arise  integrating and rationalizing td waterhouse s branch operations to serve the combined client base of td ameritrade  minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns  and combining the corporate cultures  maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees 
the combined company may not successfully integrate the operations of ameritrade and td waterhouse in a timely manner  or at all  and the combined company may not realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of the acquisition of td waterhouse to the extent  or in the timeframe  anticipated 
the anticipated benefits and synergies include cost savings associated with anticipated restructurings and other operational efficiencies  greater economies of scale and revenue enhancement opportunities 
however  these anticipated benefits and synergies assume a successful integration and are based on projections  which are inherently uncertain  and other assumptions 
even if integration is successful  anticipated benefits and synergies may not be achieved 
in addition to the integration risks discussed above  the combined company s ability to realize these benefits and synergies could be adversely impacted by practical or legal constraints on its ability to combine operations or implement workforce reductions 
the market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the acquisition of td waterhouse 
the market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the acquisition of td waterhouse if  among other things  the integration of the ameritrade and td waterhouse businesses is unsuccessful  if the operational cost savings estimates are not realized  if the expected revenue opportunities are not realized  if the transaction costs related to the acquisition of td waterhouse are greater than expected or if the financing of the special dividend is on unfavorable terms 
the market price also may decline if we do not achieve the 
table of contents perceived benefits of the acquisition of td waterhouse as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts or if the effect of the acquisition of td waterhouse on our financial results is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts

td and the ricketts holders will exercise significant influence over td ameritrade 
when the acquisition of td waterhouse is completed  td will own approximately  and the ricketts holders will own approximately  of the outstanding voting securities of td ameritrade 
following the completion of the acquisition of td waterhouse  td will commence a tender offer with the goal of increasing its ownership to of the outstanding shares of ameritrade common stock 
j 
joe ricketts may elect to participate as a co bidder in the tender offer with td or otherwise purchase shares of td ameritrade common stock  such that the ricketts holders own up to of the outstanding shares of ameritrade common stock 
mr 
ricketts has informed ameritrade that he does not intend to participate as a co bidder in the tender offer 
td will be permitted under the terms of the stockholders agreement to acquire up to of the outstanding shares of td ameritrade common stock during the three years following the closing  up to of the outstanding shares of td ameritrade common stock for the remainder of the term of the stockholders agreement a maximum of years following the closing and an unlimited number of shares of ameritrade following the termination of the stockholders agreement 
as a result  td and the ricketts holders generally will have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of any matter submitted for the vote of td ameritrade stockholders 
the stockholders agreement also provides that td will designate five of the twelve members of the td ameritrade board of directors and the ricketts holders will designate three of the twelve members of the td ameritrade board of directors  subject to adjustment based on their respective ownership positions in td ameritrade 
accordingly  td and the ricketts holders generally will be able to significantly influence the outcome of all matters that come before the td ameritrade board 
as a result of their significant interest in td ameritrade  td or the ricketts holders may have the power  subject to applicable law  to significantly influence actions that might be favorable to td or the ricketts holders  but not necessarily favorable to other td ameritrade stockholders 
in addition  the ownership position and governance rights of td and the ricketts holders could discourage a third party from proposing a change of control or other strategic transaction concerning td ameritrade 
as a result  the common stock of td ameritrade could trade at prices that do not reflect a takeover premium to the same extent as do the stocks of similarly situated companies that do not have a stockholder with an ownership interest as large as td s and the ricketts holders combined ownership interest 
conflicts of interest may arise between td ameritrade and td  which may be resolved in a manner that adversely affects td ameritrade s business  financial condition or results of operations 
conflicts of interest may arise between td ameritrade and td in areas relating to past  ongoing and future relationships  including corporate opportunities  potential acquisitions or financing transactions  sales or other dispositions by td of its interests in td ameritrade and the exercise by td of its influence over the management and affairs of td ameritrade 
it is expected that after the acquisition of td waterhouse a significant number of the directors on the td ameritrade board will be persons who are also officers or directors of td or its subsidiaries 
service as a director or officer of both td ameritrade and td or its other subsidiaries could create conflicts of interest if such directors or officers are faced with decisions that could have materially different implications for td ameritrade and for td 
our post transaction amended and restated certificate of incorporation will contain provisions relating to avoidance of direct competition between td ameritrade and td 
the parties have not established any other formal procedures for td ameritrade and td to resolve potential or actual conflicts of interest between them 
there can be no assurance that any of the foregoing conflicts will be resolved in a manner that does not adversely affect the business  financial condition or results of operations of td ameritrade 
in addition  the provisions of the stockholders agreement related to non competition are subject to numerous exceptions and qualifications and may not prevent td ameritrade and td from competing with each other to some degree in the future 

table of contents we will incur significant indebtedness in connection with the transaction 
in connection with payment of the special cash dividend of per share and to fund working capital requirements after the acquisition of td waterhouse  we will be required to borrow approximately billion 
it is a condition to the completion of the transaction that we shall have available sufficient funds  and shall be permitted under applicable law  to pay the special dividend  and that we declare the dividend 
although we currently expect that such financing will be available on commercially reasonable terms  there can be no assurance of this 
following the completion of the acquisition of td waterhouse  our ability to meet our cash requirements  including our debt service obligations  will be dependent upon our future performance  which will be subject to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are or may be beyond our control 
we cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations to fund these cash requirements and debt service obligations 
if we are unable to meet our cash requirements from operations  we would be required to fund these cash requirements by alternative financing 
the degree to which we may be leveraged as a result of the indebtedness incurred in connection with payment of the special dividend or otherwise could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for working capital  acquisitions or other purposes  could make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures or could limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes and opportunities in our industry  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain alternative financing  that any such financing would be on acceptable terms or that we would be permitted to do so under the terms of existing financing arrangements  including those entered into in connection with the payment of the special dividend 
in the absence of such financing  our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions  make future acquisitions  react to adverse operating results  meet our debt service obligations  or fund required capital expenditures  could be materially and adversely affected 
some of our directors and executive officers have interests in the acquisition of td waterhouse that may differ from the interests of ameritrade stockholders including  if the acquisition of td waterhouse is completed  the receipt of financial and other benefits 
our executive officers and directors have interests in the acquisition of td waterhouse that may be different from  or in addition to  your interests 
for example  we are currently considering a new employment agreement with joseph h 
moglia with respect to his continued employment as our chief executive officer 
in addition  we may negotiate and enter into after consultation with td if prior to the closing new or amended employment agreements with other executive officers 
in connection with the acquisition of td waterhouse  our directors and executive officers  who beneficially own approximately  shares of our common stock as of november   will receive an aggregate of approximately million as a result of the payment of proposed special dividend of per share assuming the timely exercise of all vested options 
the beneficial ownership of our directors and executive officers includes options to purchase  shares of our common stock exercisable within days of november  in connection with the proposed special dividend  we will adjust outstanding equity awards under our stock option plans to preserve the pre dividend economic value of the awards after payment of the special dividend 
as of november   our directors and executive officers collectively held options vested and unvested to purchase  shares of common stock with a weighted average exercise price of per share 
these options will be adjusted unless exercised prior to the ex dividend date 
in addition  under the terms of the stockholders agreement  the ricketts holders will have  among other things  specified rights relating to board representation and the ability to acquire additional ameritrade common stock to maintain their ownership position 
j 
joe ricketts may also elect  following the closing of the acquisition of td waterhouse  to participate in a tender offer with td  such that upon completion of the tender offer  the ricketts holders may own up to of the outstanding voting securities of td ameritrade 
mr 
ricketts has informed ameritrade that he does not intend to participate as a co bidder in the tender offer 

table of contents in addition  on november   j 
joe ricketts and his wife entered into a million credit facility with an affiliate of td secured by ameritrade stock 
further  under the terms of the amended and restated registration rights agreement  the ricketts holders and some of the other ameritrade directors or their affiliates will continue to be entitled to registration rights with respect to their securities of td ameritrade 
the acquisition of td waterhouse is subject to the receipt of consents and approvals from government entities that may not be received or that may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on td ameritrade following the completion of the acquisition 
ameritrade and td cannot complete the acquisition of td waterhouse unless they receive various consents  orders  approvals and clearances from authorities in the us and canada 
while ameritrade and td believe that they will receive the requisite regulatory approvals from these authorities  there can be no assurance of this 
in addition  these authorities may impose conditions on the completion of the acquisition of td waterhouse or require changes to the terms of the acquisition of td waterhouse 
for example  nasd could require changes to the operations or supervisory controls of the brokerage firms 
while td and ameritrade do not currently expect that any conditions or changes would be imposed  there can be no assurance that they will not be  and such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying completion of the acquisition of td waterhouse or imposing additional costs on or limiting the revenues of ameritrade following the acquisition of td waterhouse  any of which may have an adverse effect on ameritrade following the acquisition of td waterhouse 
the adjustment to outstanding grants of employee non qualified stock options may result in the loss of a tax deduction for certain executives grants 
we intend to adjust outstanding equity awards  including non qualified stock options that have been granted to employees in prior years  in order to preserve the pre dividend economic value of such options after the payment of the special dividend 
such adjustments could potentially result in the disallowance of the tax deduction we would otherwise be entitled to in the future when certain of our executives exercise their options 
we are currently seeking guidance from the internal revenue service that the proposed adjustments to the outstanding options will not adversely affect our tax deduction in future years 
if we are unable to obtain a favorable ruling from the internal revenue service regarding such tax deductions  then our future cash flow could be negatively impacted 
the internal revenue service may determine that our computation of the taxable portion of the special dividend is incorrect 
the taxable portion of the special dividend is determined by reference to our earnings and profits  as determined under the internal revenue code  for the calendar year in which the special dividend is paid 
the computation could be subject to review by the internal revenue service  which may disagree with our computation 
any adjustment to the computation required by the internal revenue service would result in more or less of the special dividend being considered a qualified dividend with a corresponding adjustment to the amount considered as a return of capital 
such an adjustment could negatively impact the current us federal income tax consequences of the special dividend 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and market prices 
we have established policies  procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks in the normal course of our business operations 
we do not hold any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
we seek to control the risks associated with our client activities by requiring clients to maintain margin collateral in compliance with regulatory and internal guidelines 
we monitor required margin levels daily and  
table of contents pursuant to such guidelines  require our clients to deposit additional collateral  or to reduce positions  when necessary 
we seek to control risks associated with our securities lending and borrowing activities by requiring credit approvals for counterparties  by monitoring the market value of securities loaned and collateral values for securities borrowed on a daily basis and requiring additional cash as collateral for securities loaned or return of collateral for securities borrowed when necessary  and by participating in a risk sharing program offered through a securities clearinghouse 
as a fundamental part of our brokerage business  we hold interest earning assets  mainly funds required to be segregated in compliance with federal regulations 
these funds totaled billion at september  and billion at september  we invest these funds in repurchase agreements  fixed rate us treasury securities and other qualified securities 
our interest earning assets are financed primarily by short term interest bearing liabilities  totaling billion at september  and september   in the form of client credit balances 
we earn a net interest spread on the difference between amounts earned on client margin balances and amounts paid on client credit balances 
because we establish the rate paid on client credit balances and the rate charged on client margin balances  a substantial portion of our interest rate risk is under our direct management 
however  changes in interest rates may have a beneficial or adverse affect on our results of operations 
we might not change interest rates paid on client credit balances proportionately to changes in interest rates charged on client margin balances 
as a result  a rising interest rate environment generally results in our earning a larger net interest spread 
conversely  a falling interest rate environment generally results in our earning a smaller net interest spread 
we had no borrowings outstanding under our million revolving credit agreement  which bears interest at a floating rate  as of september  and no borrowings outstanding under our prior revolving credit agreement as of september  we currently hold two marketable equity securities  our investments in approximately million shares of knight and  shares of international securities exchange  inc  which were recorded at fair value of million million net of tax at september  and have exposure to market price risk 
the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent adverse change in prices quoted by the stock exchanges was approximately million at september  during fiscal  we entered into a series of prepaid variable forward contracts with a total notional amount of approximately million on million underlying knight shares 
the forward contracts each contain an embedded collar on the value of the knight shares  with a weighted average floor price of per share and a weighted average cap price of per share 
the embedded collars also have exposure to market price risk based on changes in the value of the underlying knight shares 
the embedded collars do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  and the consolidated financial statements reflect the embedded collars as non hedging derivatives 
as of september  and september   the fair value of the embedded collars was approximately million and million  respectively  and was included under the caption prepaid variable forward derivative instrument on the consolidated balance sheets 
the potential loss in fair value of the embedded collars resulting from a hypothetical percent adverse change in price of the underlying knight shares quoted by the stock exchanges was approximately million at september  because the embedded collars do not qualify for hedge accounting  changes in the fair value of the embedded collars are recognized in the statement of operations  along with the related income tax effects  while any offsetting changes in the fair value of the underlying knight stock  which is classified as an available for sale investment  are recorded in other comprehensive income  net of income taxes 
our revenues and financial instruments are denominated in us dollars  and we generally do not invest  except for hedging purposes  in derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments
