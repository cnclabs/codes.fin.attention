item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview the following overview is a top level discussion of our operating results as well as some of the trends and drivers that affect our business 
management believes that an understanding of these trends and drivers is important in order to understand our results for fiscal  as well as our future prospects 
this summary is not intended to be exhaustive  nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this form k  including in business  the remainder of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  risk factors or the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
about electronic arts we develop  market  publish and distribute interactive software games that are playable by consumers on home video game consoles such as the sony playstation  microsoft xbox and nintendo gamecube consoles  personal computers  mobile platforms including hand held game players such as the game boy advance  nintendo ds and sony psp and cellular handsets and online  over the internet and other proprietary online networks 
some of our games are based on content that we license from others eg  madden nfl football  harry potter and fifa soccer  and some of our games are based on our own wholly owned intellectual property eg  the sims and need for speed 
our goal is to develop titles which appeal to the mass markets  which often means translating and localizing them for sale in non english speaking countries 
in addition  we also attempt to create software game franchises that allow us to publish new titles on a recurring basis that are based on the same property 
examples of this are the annual iterations of our sports based franchises eg  ncaa football and fifa soccer  titles based on long lived movie properties eg  james bond and harry potter and wholly owned properties that can be successfully sequeled eg  the sims and need for speed 
overview of financial results total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march  was billion  up percent  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  six franchises sold more than five million units in the fiscal year ended march  the sims  need for speed  madden  fifa  the lord of the rings and harry potter 
we published three titles each on the nintendo ds and the sony psp  two new platforms released during the year ended march  net revenue on these platforms increased our net revenue by approximately million and we expect to continue to develop titles for both platforms in fiscal net income for the fiscal year ended march  was million  a percent decrease as compared to the fiscal year ended march  and diluted earnings per share were as compared with for the prior year 
we generated million in cash from operations during the year ended march  as compared to million in the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in cash flow was primarily the result of our overall decline in net income for fiscal  higher accounts receivable balances due to the timing of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal and higher cash payments for income taxes 
these declines were partially offset by higher balances in our current liabilities 
management s overview of historical and prospective business trends transition to next generation consoles 
our industry is cyclical and we believe it has entered into a transition stage heading into the next cycle 
over the course of the next eighteen months  we expect sony  microsoft and nintendo to introduce new video game consoles into the market 
during this transition  we intend to continue developing new titles for the current generation of video game consoles while we also make significant investments as we prepare to introduce products that operate on the next generation consoles 
we have and expect to continue to incur higher costs during this transition to next generation consoles 
we also expect development costs for next generation video games to be greater on a per title basis than development costs for current generation video games 
in addition  sales of video games for current generation consoles may begin to decline and consumers may defer game software purchases until the next generation consoles become 
table of contents available 
while we expect our sales and gross profit to increase in fiscal  such increases may not offset the increased costs we have and expect to continue to incur during the transition 
as we move through the transition  we expect our operating results to be more volatile and difficult to predict  which could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly 
increasing cost of titles 
titles have become increasingly expensive to produce and market as the platforms on which they are played continue to advance technologically and consumers demand continual improvements in the overall gameplay experience 
we expect this trend to continue throughout the transition from current generation to next generation platforms as we require larger production teams to create our titles  the technology needed to develop titles becomes more complex  the number and nature of the platforms for which we develop titles increases and becomes more diverse  the cost of licensing the third party intellectual property we use in many of our titles increases  and we develop new methods to distribute our content via the internet and on hand held and wireless devices 
software prices 
as current generation console prices continue to decrease  we expect more value oriented consumers to purchase consoles and software 
we experienced this trend several years ago when prices were reduced on previous generation consoles eg  sony playstation and nintendo 
as a result of a more value oriented consumer base  and a greater number of software titles being published  we expect average software prices to continue to decline on current generation consoles  which may have a negative impact on our gross margin but not necessarily our gross profit 
sales of hit titles 
sales of hit titles  several of which were top sellers across a number of international markets  continued to contribute to our revenue growth 
our top five selling titles across all platforms worldwide during the fiscal year ended march  were need for speed underground  madden nfl  fifa soccer  the sims and harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban 
hit titles are important to our financial performance because they benefit from overall economies of scale 
we have developed  and it is our objective to continue to develop  many of our hit titles to become franchise titles that can be regularly iterated 
increased console installed base 
as consumers purchase the current generation of consoles  either as a first time buyer or by upgrading from a previous generation  the console installed base increases 
as the installed base for a particular console increases  we generally are able to increase our unit volume  however  these unit volumes often begin to decrease as consumers anticipate the release of the next generation of consoles 
in march  microsoft reduced the retail price of its xbox console in the us and in may sony did the same with its playstation console 
in august  both companies also reduced their console retail prices in europe 
although these price reductions drove an increase in console sales in the united states and europe  hardware shortages during the holiday season limited the growth of the installed base in fiscal nonetheless  we believe the significant increase in the installed base for current generation consoles was a contributing factor to our total net revenue growth during fiscal provided that the console manufacturers are able to deliver an adequate supply of consoles  we expect the installed base of current generation consoles to increase during fiscal and unit sales of current generation titles to remain strong 
international operations and sales growth 
in fiscal  net revenue from international sales accounted for approximately percent of our total net revenue  up from percent during fiscal our increase in international net revenue was primarily driven by sales in europe and asia pacific  including the benefit of foreign exchange 
we anticipate that international net revenue will continue to increase during fiscal as the console installed base continues to expand outside of north america 
in particular  we believe that in order to succeed in china and japan  it is important to develop content locally 
as such  we expect to devote resources to hire local development talent and expand our infrastructure in each country  most notably  the expansion and creation of local studio facilities 
in addition  we anticipate establishing online game marketing  publishing and distribution functions in china 
as part of this strategy  we may seek to partner with established local companies through acquisitions  joint ventures or other similar arrangements 
foreign exchange impact 
given that a significant portion of our business is conducted internationally in foreign currency  fluctuations in currency prices can have a material impact on our results of operations 
for example  the average exchange rate for the euro  as compared to the us dollar  increased from per euro during the twelve months ended march  to per euro during the twelve months ended march  as a result of the fluctuations in currency prices  we had a total foreign exchange benefit on 
table of contents net revenue of approximately million during the twelve months ended march  although we intend to continue to utilize foreign exchange forward and option contracts to either mitigate or hedge against some foreign currency exposures  we cannot predict the effect foreign currency fluctuations will have on us during fiscal expansion of studio resources and technology 
in fiscal  we devoted significant resources to the overall expansion of our studio facilities in north america and europe 
we expect to continue to make significant investments in our studio facilities in north america in fiscal as we move through the life cycle of current generation consoles  we will continue to devote significant resources to the development of current generation titles while at the same time we continue to invest heavily in tools and technologies for the next generation of platforms and technology 
leader in interactive sports entertainment 
we are a leading developer and publisher of interactive sports entertainment 
we generate a significant portion of our revenue from sports related product franchises such as fifa soccer  madden nfl football  ncaa football  tiger woods golf  nascar  nba basketball  and ncaa basketball 
we recently have taken a number of steps to enhance our products in the interactive sports category by entering into exclusive license agreements with espn  the nfl  players  inc the nfl players association  collegiate licensing company ncaa football  and the arena football league 
in addition  we have long standing  exclusive relationships with various sports organizations and celebrities  including fifa the worldwide soccer governing body and sponsor of the soccer world cup  uefa the european soccer governing body and sponsor of the soccer euro cup  nascar  tiger woods and the pga tour  and  in the future  we may enter into other exclusive relationships with other sports partners 
while we expect to generate increased revenue as a result of these agreements  it may not be enough to offset the impact of the associated costs on our gross profit  which could negatively affect our gross margin on these products 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  contingent assets and liabilities  and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown 
as a result  actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
revenue recognition  sales returns  allowances and bad debt reserves we principally derive revenue from sales of packaged interactive software games designed for play on video game consoles such as the playstation  xbox and nintendo gamecube  pcs and mobile platforms including hand held game players such as the nintendo game boy advance  nintendo ds and sony psp and cellular handsets 
we evaluate the recognition of revenue based on the criteria set forth in statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions and staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as revised by sab no 
 revenue recognition 
we evaluate revenue recognition using the following basic criteria and recognize revenue when all four criteria are met evidence of an arrangement we recognize revenue when we have evidence of an agreement with the customer reflecting the terms and conditions to deliver products 
delivery delivery is considered to occur when the products are shipped and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer 
for online games and services  revenue is recognized as the service is provided 
fixed or determinable fee if a portion of the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize that amount as revenue when the amount becomes fixed or determinable 

table of contents collection is deemed probable at the time of the transaction  we conduct a credit review of each customer involved in a significant transaction to determine the creditworthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if we expect the customer to be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as those amounts become due 
if we determine that collection is not probable  we recognize revenue when collection becomes probable generally upon cash collection 
determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
for example  for multiple element arrangements  we must make assumptions and judgments in order to determine whether and when each element has been delivered  determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services  determine whether vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe exists for each undelivered element  and allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver 
changes to any of these assumptions or judgments  or changes to the elements in a software arrangement  could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
product revenue  including sales to resellers and distributors channel partners  is recognized when the above criteria are met 
we reduce product revenue for estimated future returns  price protection  and other offerings  which may occur with our customers and channel partners 
in certain countries  we have stock balancing programs for our pc products  which allow for the exchange of pc products by resellers under certain circumstances 
it is our general practice to exchange products or give credits  rather than give cash refunds 
in certain countries  from time to time  we decide to provide price protection for both our pc and video game system products 
in our decision  we analyze historical returns  current sell through of distributor and retailer inventory of our products  current trends in the video game market and the overall economy  changes in consumer demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and price protection allowances 
in addition  we monitor the volume of our sales to our channel partners and their inventories  as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel could result in high returns or higher price protection costs in subsequent periods 
while historically actual returns and price protection have not generally exceeded our reserves  as we have previously publicly stated  in the quarter ended march  we incurred higher actual returns and price protection than we had anticipated 
we have reviewed current sell through information through the date of this filing and do not intend to accept sales returns or provide price protection on unsold product in our distribution channels existing as of march  in amounts in excess of our march  allowances 
in the future  actual returns and price protections may materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences  market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms  product updates or competing products 
for example  the risk of product returns and or price protection for our products may increase as the playstation  xbox and nintendo gamecube consoles move through their lifecycles and an increasing number and aggregate amount of competitive products heighten pricing and competitive pressures 
while management believes it can make reliable estimates regarding these matters  these estimates are inherently subjective 
accordingly  if our estimates changed  our returns and price protection reserves would change  which would impact the total net revenue we report 
for example  if actual returns and or price protection were significantly greater than the reserves we have established  our actual results would decrease our reported total net revenue 
conversely  if actual returns and or price protection were significantly less than our reserves  this would increase our reported total net revenue 
significant judgment is required to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating customer creditworthiness in the context of current economic trends 
depending upon the overall economic climate and the financial condition of our customers  the amount and timing of our bad debt expense and cash collection could change significantly 
royalties and licenses our royalty expenses consist of payments to content licensors  independent software developers  and co publishing and or distribution affiliates 
license royalties consist of payments made to celebrities  
table of contents professional sports organizations  movie studios and other organizations for our use of their trademark  copyright  personal publicity rights  content and or other intellectual property 
royalty payments to independent software developers are payments for the development of intellectual property related to our games 
co publishing and distribution royalties are payments made to third parties for delivery of product 
royalty based payments made to content licensors and distribution affiliates generally are capitalized as prepaid royalties and expensed to cost of goods sold at the greater of the contractual or effective royalty rate based on net product sales 
prepayments made to thinly capitalized independent software developers and co publishing affiliates are generally in connection with the development of a particular product and  therefore  we are generally subject to development risk prior to the general release of the product 
accordingly  payments that are due prior to completion of a product are generally expensed as research and development as the services are incurred 
payments due after completion of the product primarily royalty based in nature are generally expensed as cost of goods sold at the higher of the contractual or effective royalty rate based on net product sales 
minimum guaranteed royalty obligations are initially recorded as an asset and as a liability at the contractual amount when no significant performance remains with the licensor 
when significant performance remains with the licensor  we record royalty payments as an asset when actually paid rather than upon execution of the contract 
minimum royalty payment obligations are classified as current liabilities to the extent such royalty payments are contractually due within the next twelve months 
as of march  and march   approximately million and million  respectively  of minimum guaranteed royalty obligations had been recognized 
each quarter  we also evaluate the future realization of our royalty based assets as well as any unrecognized minimum commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely to be realized through product sales 
any impairments determined before the launch of a product are charged to research and development expense 
impairments determined post launch are charged to cost of goods sold 
in either case  we rely on estimated revenue to evaluate the future realization of prepaid royalties 
if actual sales or revised revenue estimates fall below the initial revenue estimate  then the actual charge taken may be greater in any given quarter than anticipated 
as of march   we had million of royalty related assets and  million of unrecognized minimum commitments not yet paid that could be impaired if our revenue estimates change 
valuation of long lived assets we evaluate both purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets in order to determine if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in value exists 
this evaluation requires us to estimate  among other things  the remaining useful lives of the assets and future cash flows of the business 
these evaluations and estimates require the use of judgment 
our actual results could differ materially from our current estimates 
under current accounting standards  we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
in order to determine if a potential impairment has occurred  management makes various assumptions about the future value of the asset by evaluating future business prospects and estimated cash flows 
our future net cash flows are primarily dependent on the sale of products for play on proprietary video game consoles  hand held game players and pcs collectively referred to as platforms 
the success of our products is affected by our ability to accurately predict which platforms and which products we develop will be successful 
also  our revenue and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules 
due to product sales shortfalls  we may not realize the future net cash flows necessary to recover our long lived assets  which may result in an impairment charge being recorded in the future 
we did not record any asset impairment charges in fiscal during fiscal and  we recognized less than million and million  respectively  of asset impairment charges 

table of contents income taxes in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the tax law and ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods 
this process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction where we operate 
these estimates involve complex issues  require extended periods of time to resolve  and require us to make judgments  such as anticipating the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to our actually preparing the returns and the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities 
we are also required to make determinations of the need to record deferred tax liabilities and the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is established to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction 
in addition  changes in our business  such as acquisitions  changes in our international structure  changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets  changes in the geographic mix of income  as well as changes in  or termination of  our agreements with tax authorities  valuation allowances  applicable accounting rules  applicable tax laws and regulations  rulings and interpretations thereof  developments in tax audit and other matters  and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pre tax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate for future fiscal years 
for example  in the three months ended march   we resolved certain tax related matters with the internal revenue service  which lowered our income tax expense by approximately million and resulted in a percent rate reduction for the fiscal year ended march  by contrast  adverse developments in audits or applicable law result in increases in our tax expense 
similarly  we could experience an increase in our tax expense if we take advantage of a new election that we are entitled to make under the us income tax rules regarding the allocation between us and foreign jurisdictions of tax deductions attributable to employee stock option compensation 
results of operations our fiscal year is reported on a week period that  historically  has ended on the final saturday of march in each year 
the results of operations for the fiscal years ended march   and each contain weeks and ended on march   march  and march   respectively 
for simplicity of presentation  all fiscal periods are treated as ending on a calendar month end 
beginning with the fiscal year ending march   we will end our fiscal year on the saturday nearest march as a result  our fiscal will be reported as a week year with the first quarter containing weeks 
although certain amounts presented have been rounded to the nearest million  corresponding percentage changes have been calculated on the basis of amounts rounded to the nearest thousand 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal net revenue we principally derive net revenue from sales of packaged interactive software games designed for play on video game consoles such as the playstation  xbox and nintendo gamecube  pcs and mobile platforms which include hand held game players such as the nintendo game boy advance  nintendo ds and sony psp and cellular handsets 
additionally  in europe and asia pacific  we generate a significant portion of net revenue by marketing and selling third party interactive software games through our established distribution network 
we also derive net revenue from selling subscriptions to some of our online games  programming third party web sites with our game content  allowing other companies to manufacture and sell our products in conjunction with other products  and selling advertisements on our online web pages

the net revenue increase was also driven by sales of titles in our fight night and burnout franchises  neither of which had corresponding titles released in the prior fiscal year 
together  these items resulted in a net revenue increase of million during the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  this increase was partially offset by lower sales of products in our medal of honor  ssx and lord of the rings franchises  which reduced net revenue by million in the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  as part of this overall increase in net revenue  we benefited from the launch of the nintendo ds and sony psp in november and march  respectively 
europe for fiscal  net revenue in europe increased by percent as compared to fiscal we estimate foreign exchange rates primarily the euro and the british pound sterling strengthened reported european net revenue by approximately million  or percent  for the fiscal year ended march  excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates  we estimate that european net revenue increased by approximately million  or percent  for the year ended march  from a franchise perspective  the net revenue increase was primarily due to higher sales of products in our need for speed and the sims franchises  sales of products in our burnout franchise which did not have a corresponding title release in the prior fiscal year and sales of uefa euro  which was released during the three months ended june  in conjunction with the uefa euro football tournament held in europe

the increase in mobility net revenue was primarily due to the release of titles in conjunction with the launch of the nintendo ds and psp platforms in north america and japan 
co publishing and distribution in fiscal  net revenue from co publishing and distribution products decreased by million to million as compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a significant decrease in the number of co publishing and distribution titles we released in fiscal we released six co publishing titles in fiscal as compared to titles in fiscal subscription services in fiscal  net revenue from subscription services products increased by million to million as compared to fiscal the increase in net revenue was primarily due to an increase in the number of paying subscribers to club pogo  partially offset by a decrease in subscription net revenue from earth beyond tm and the sims tm online subscription services

costs of goods sold for fiscal years and were in millions march  of net march  of net revenue revenue change in fiscal  cost of goods sold as a percentage of total net revenue increased percent from percent to percent 
as a percentage of total net revenue  the increase was primarily due to a percent increase for pricing actions taken in both north america and europe due to higher than anticipated channel inventory  inventory related costs due to non recurring rebates across several titles  and incremental costs incurred to produce our titles for the nintendo ds and sony psp 
in addition  warranty and online costs increased by percent 

table of contents offsetting these increases was a decrease of percent  primarily the result of lower co publishing and distribution royalties due to the lower mix of co publishing and distribution net revenue during the year ended march  as compared to the year ended march  we expect cost of goods sold as a percentage of total net revenue to remain flat during fiscal as compared to fiscal we expect margin pressure as a result of a decrease in average selling prices as current generation platforms mature and our industry transitions to next generation technology and higher license royalty rates 
although there can be no assurance  and our actual results could differ materially  we expect this pressure to be essentially offset by lower manufacturing royalty rates  lower outside development expense and  to some extent  product mix

in addition  we may incur additional tax expense to the extent we undertake certain international restructurings that we are considering 
the american jobs creation act of the jobs act  enacted on october   provides for a temporary percent dividends received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated in fiscal or fiscal the deduction would result in an approximate percent federal tax on a portion of the foreign earnings repatriated

impact of recently issued accounting standards in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb ratified the other than temporary impairment measurement and recognition guidance and certain disclosure requirements for impaired securities as described in eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
in september  the fasb issued a proposed staff position fsp eitf issue no 
a  implementation guidance for the application of paragraph of eitf 
the proposed fsp will provide measurement and recognition guidance with respect to debt securities that are impaired solely due to interest rates and or sector spreads 
in october  the fasb delayed the effective date for the other than temporary impairment measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs of eitf issue no 
until fsp issue no 
a is issued 
however  this delay does not suspend the requirement to recognize other than temporary impairments as required by existing authoritative literature  nor does it delay the required disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments in paragraphs of eitf issue no 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management is unable to determine what impact the adoption of the measurement and recognition guidance in eitf issue no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter 
sfas no 
amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage and requires that those items be recognized as current period charges 
sfas no 
also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  management believes the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchange of non monetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 

sfas no 
amends accounting principles board apb no 
 accounting 
table of contents for non monetary transactions  to eliminate the exception for non monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of non monetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
sfas no 
is effective for non monetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  management believes the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements using a fair value based method 
the statement replaces sfas no 
 supersedes apb no 
 and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
while the fair value method under sfas no 
r is very similar to the fair value method under sfas no 
with regards to measurement and recognition of stock based compensation  management is currently evaluating the impact of several of the key differences between the two standards on our consolidated financial statements 
for example  sfas no 
permits us to recognize forfeitures as they occur while sfas no 
r will require us to estimate future forfeitures and adjust our estimate on a quarterly basis 
sfas no 
r also will require a classification change in the statement of cash flows  whereby a portion of the tax benefit from stock options will move from operating cash flow activities to financing cash flow activities total cash flows will remain unchanged 
in march  the securities and exchange commission sec released sab no 
 share based payment  which provides the views of the staff regarding the interaction between sfas no 
r and certain sec rules and regulations for public companies 
in april  the sec adopted a rule that amends the compliance dates of sfas no 
r 
under the revised compliance dates  we will be required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r no later than the first interim period of fiscal while management continues to evaluate the impact of sfas no 
r on our consolidated financial statements  we currently believe that the expensing of stock based compensation will have an impact on our consolidated statements of operations similar to our pro forma disclosure under sfas no

table of contents overall decline in net income for fiscal  higher accounts receivable balances due to the timing of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal and higher cash payments for income taxes 
these declines were partially offset by higher balances in our current liabilities 
we expect to continue to generate significant operating cash flow in fiscal for the year ended march   our primary use of cash in non operating activities consisted of net purchases of  million in short term investments  million in capital expenditures  primarily related to the expansions of our los angeles and vancouver studios as well as upgrades to our worldwide erp systems  million for our purchase of a percent investment in ubisoft  million for our acquisitions of percent of criterion and an additional percent of dice  and million towards the repurchase and retirement of our common stock 
these non operating expenditures were partially offset by million in proceeds from the sale of our common stock through stock plans and million in proceeds from the sale of property during the year ended march  we anticipate making continued capital investments in our vancouver studio during fiscal as well as completing the remaining million of our million share repurchase program by september  short term investments and marketable equity securities the composition of our portfolio of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments changed from primarily cash equivalents  which were billion as of march   to primarily short term investments  which were billion as of march  and  therefore  our portfolio is more susceptible to changes in short term interest rates 
as of march   our short term investments had gross unrealized losses of approximately million or percent of the total in short term investments 
from time to time  we may liquidate some or all of our short term investments to fund operational needs or other activities  such as capital expenditures  business acquisitions  or stock repurchase programs 
depending on the short term investments that we liquidate to fund these activities  we could recognize a portion of the gross unrealized losses 
marketable equity securities increased to million as of march   from million as of march   primarily due to our purchase of a percent investment in ubisoft entertainment 
receivables  net our gross accounts receivable balance was million and million as of march  and march   respectively 
the increase in our accounts receivable balance was primarily due to an increase in our fourth quarter gross sales prior to reserve adjustments versus the prior year and the timing of those sales  which occurred later in the fourth quarter of fiscal than in the prior year 
we expect to collect a substantial portion of these amounts in the three months ended june  reserves for sales returns  pricing allowances and doubtful accounts increased from million as of march  to million as of march  both the sales return and price protection reserves increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of trailing six month net revenue and remained relatively flat as a percentage of trailing nine month net revenue as of march  we believe these reserves are adequate based on historical experience and our current estimate of potential returns and allowances 
inventories inventories increased to million as of march  from million as of march  primarily due to overall growth in europe 
we typically have a higher inventory balance  as a percentage of net revenue  on hand in europe than in north america  due to the need to provide multiple language versions of each title in that region 
no single title represented more than million of inventory as of march  other current assets other current assets increased to million as of march   from million as of march   primarily due to the amortization of certain prepaid amounts and collections of advertising credits owed to us by our suppliers offset by higher prepaid royalties as we continue to invest in our product development

we anticipate our accrued and other liabilities balance will decline following our bonus payments during the three months ended june  financial condition we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  marketable equity securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months  including working capital requirements  capital expenditures  potential future acquisitions or strategic investments  and funding of our stock repurchase program 
we may choose at any time to raise additional capital to strengthen our financial position  facilitate expansion  pursue strategic investments or to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise 
there can be no guarantee that such additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all  or that it will not result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders

we believe the estimated fair values of both properties under these operating leases are in excess of their respective guaranteed residual values as of march  for the two lease agreements with keybank national association  as described above  the lease rates are based upon the commercial paper rate and require us to maintain certain financial covenants as shown below  all of which we were in compliance with as of march  actual as of financial covenants requirement march  consolidated net worth in millions fixed charge coverage ratio total consolidated debt to capital quick ratio q q n a q q as our two lease agreements with keybank national association are scheduled to expire in june and july  we currently are evaluating whether to extend the leases  purchase the properties under lease  or identify a third party buyer for the properties when the leases expire 
we have not yet determined the course of action that we will take 
see the liquidity and capital resources section above for additional information 
in july  we entered into a lease agreement with an independent third party the landlord for a studio facility in los angeles  california  which commenced in october and expires in september with two five year options to extend the lease term 
additionally  we have options to purchase the property after five and ten years based on the fair market value of the property at the date of sale  a right of first offer to purchase the property upon terms offered by the landlord  and a right to share in the profits from a sale of the property

litigation on july   a class action lawsuit  kirschenbaum v 
electronic arts inc  was filed against us in superior court in san mateo  california 
the complaint alleges that we improperly classified image production employees in california as exempt employees and seeks injunctive relief  unspecified monetary damages  interest and attorneys fees 
the complaint was first amended on or about november  to add two former employees as named plaintiffs  and amended again on or about january  to add another former employee as a named plaintiff 
the allegations in the complaint were not materially changed by the amendments 
on february   a second employment related class action lawsuit  hasty v 
electronic arts inc  was filed against us in superior court in san mateo  california 
the complaint alleges that we improperly classified engineers in california as exempt employees and seeks injunctive relief  unspecified monetary damages  interest and attorneys fees 
on or about march   we received a first amended complaint  which contains the same material allegations as the original complaint 
we answered the first amended complaint on april  on march   a purported class action lawsuit was filed against us and certain of our officers and directors 
the complaint  which asserts claims under section b and a of the securities exchange act of based on allegedly false and misleading statements  was filed in the united states district court  northern district of california  by an individual purporting to represent a class of purchasers of ea common stock 
additional purported class action lawsuits have been filed in the same court by other individuals asserting the same claims against us 
we have not yet responded to any of the complaints 
in addition  on april   a shareholder derivative action was filed against certain of our officers and directors 
this suit asserts claims based on substantially the same factual allegations set forth in the federal class action lawsuits 
the complaint was filed in san mateo superior court 
on april   a second shareholder derivative action was filed in san mateo superior court based on the same claims as the first complaint 
on may   a shareholder derivative action based on substantially the same allegations was filed in the united states district court  northern district of california 
we have not responded to the shareholder derivative complaints 
in addition  we are subject to other claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
our management considers that any liability from any reasonably foreseeable disposition of such other claims and litigation  individually or in the aggregate  would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
director indemnity agreements we have entered into indemnification agreement with the members of our board of directors to indemnify them to the extent permitted by law against any and all liabilities  costs  expenses  amounts paid in settlement 
table of contents and damages incurred by the directors as a result of any lawsuit  or any judicial  administrative or investigative proceeding in which the directors are sued as a result of their service as members of our board of directors 
inflation we believe the impact of inflation on our results of operations has not been significant for each of the past three fiscal years 
risk factors our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties  which may affect our future financial performance 
if any of the events or circumstances described below occurs  our business and financial performance could be harmed  our actual results could differ materially from our expectations and the market value of our securities could decline 
the risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face 
there may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material that may harm our business and financial performance 
our business is highly dependent on the success and timely release of new video game platforms  on the continued availability of existing video game platforms  as well as our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms 
we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products for play on video game platforms manufactured by third parties  such as sony s playstation and microsoft s xbox 
the success of our business is driven in large part by the availability of an adequate supply of current generation video game platforms  the timely release and success of new video game hardware systems  our ability to accurately predict which platforms will be most successful in the marketplace  and our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms 
we must make product development decisions and commit significant resources well in advance of the anticipated introduction of a new platform 
a new platform for which we are developing products may be delayed  may not succeed or may have a shorter life cycle than anticipated 
if the platforms for which we are developing products are not released when anticipated  are not available in adequate amounts to meet consumer demand  or do not attain wide market acceptance  our revenue will suffer  we may be unable to fully recover the resources we have committed  and our financial performance will be harmed 
our industry is cyclical and has entered a transition period heading into the next cycle 
during the transition  we expect our costs to increase  we may experience a decline in sales as consumers anticipate and adopt next generation products and our operating results may suffer and become more difficult to predict 
video game platforms have historically had a life cycle of four to six years  which causes the video game software market to be cyclical as well 
sony s playstation was introduced in and microsoft s xbox and the nintendo gamecube were introduced in over the course of the next eighteen months  we expect sony  microsoft and nintendo to introduce new video game platforms into the market so called next generation platforms 
as a result  we believe that the interactive entertainment industry has entered into a transition stage leading into the next cycle 
during this transition  we intend to continue developing new titles for the current generation of video game platforms while we also make significant investments preparing to introduce products upon the launch of the next generation platforms 
we have and expect to continue to incur increased costs during the transition to next generation platforms  which are not likely to be offset in the near future 
we also expect development costs for next generation video games to be greater on a per title basis than development costs for current generation video games 
further  we expect that  as the current generation of platforms reaches the end of its cycle and next generation platforms are introduced into the market  sales of video games for current generation consoles may begin to decline 
consumers may defer game software purchases until the next generation platforms become available 
this decline may not be offset by increased sales of products for the new platforms 
for example  following the launch of sony s playstation platform  we experienced a significant decline in revenue from sales of products for sony s older playstation game console  which was not immediately offset by revenue generated from sales of products for the playstation 
table of contents platform 
if the increased costs we have incurred and expect to continue to incur are not offset during the transition  our operating results will suffer and our financial position will be harmed 
in addition  during this transition  we expect our operating results to be more volatile and difficult to predict  which could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly 
our platform licensors set the royalty rates and other fees that we must pay to publish games for their platforms  and therefore have significant influence on our costs 
if one or more of the platform licensors adopt a different fee structure for future game consoles or we are unable to obtain such licenses  our profitability will be materially impacted 
in the next eighteen months  we expect our platform licensors to introduce new video game platforms into the market 
for example  microsoft and sony have indicated that they plan to release next generation successors to the xbox and playstation  respectively  over the course of the next eighteen months 
in order to publish products for a new game machine  we must take a license from the platform licensor which gives the platform licensor the opportunity to set the fee structure that we must pay in order to publish games for that platform 
similarly  certain platform licensors have retained the flexibility to change their fee structures for online gameplay and features for their consoles 
the control that platform licensors have over the fee structures for their future platforms and online access makes it difficult for us to predict our costs and profitability in the medium to long term 
it is also possible that platform licensors will not renew our licenses 
because publishing products for video game consoles is the largest portion of our business  any increase in fee structures or failure to secure a license relationship would significantly harm our ability to generate revenues and or profits 
if we do not consistently meet our product development schedules  our operating results will be adversely affected 
our business is highly seasonal  with the highest levels of consumer demand  and a significant percentage of our revenue  occurring in the december quarter 
in addition  we seek to release many of our products in conjunction with specific events  such as the release of a related movie or the beginning of a sports season or major sporting event 
if we miss these key selling periods  due to product delays or delayed introduction of a new platform for which we have developed products  our sales will suffer disproportionately 
our ability to meet product development schedules is affected by a number of factors  including the creative processes involved  the coordination of large and sometimes geographically dispersed development teams required by the increasing complexity of our products  and the need to refine and tune our products prior to their release 
we have in the past experienced development delays for several of our products 
failure to meet anticipated production or go live schedules may cause a shortfall in our revenue and profitability and cause our operating results to be materially different from expectations 
if the average price of current generation titles continues to decline  our operating results will suffer 
as a result of a more value oriented consumer base caused by price reductions in current generation platforms by microsoft  sony and nintendo  a greater number of current generation titles being published  and significant pricing pressure from our competitors  we have experienced a decrease in the average price of our titles for current generation platforms 
although we believe that a few of the most popular current generation titles will continue to be launched at premium price points  as the interactive entertainment industry transitions to next generation video game platforms  we expect there to be fewer current generation titles able to command premium price points  and we expect that even these titles will be subject to price reductions at an earlier point in their sales cycle than we have seen in prior years 
we expect the average price of current generation titles to continue to decline  which will have a negative effect on our margins and operating results 
technology changes rapidly in our business  and if we fail to anticipate or successfully implement new technologies  the quality  timeliness and competitiveness of our products and services will suffer 
rapid technology changes in our industry require us to anticipate  sometimes years in advance  which technologies we must implement and take advantage of in order to make our products and services competitive in the market 
therefore  we usually start our product development with a range of technical 
table of contents development goals that we hope to be able to achieve 
we may not be able to achieve these goals  or our competition may be able to achieve them more quickly than we can 
in either case  our products and services may be technologically inferior to our competitors  less appealing to consumers  or both 
if we cannot achieve our technology goals within the original development schedule of our products and services  then we may delay their release until these technology goals can be achieved  which may delay or reduce revenue and increase our development expenses 
alternatively  we may increase the resources employed in research and development in an attempt to accelerate our development of new technologies  either to preserve our product or service launch schedule or to keep up with our competition  which would increase our development expenses 
our business is intensely competitive and hit driven 
if we do not continue to deliver hit products or if consumers prefer our competitors products over our own  our operating results could suffer 
competition in our industry is intense and we expect new competitors to continue to emerge 
while many new products are regularly introduced only a relatively small number of hit titles accounts for a significant portion of net revenue 
hit products published by our competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than we anticipate  which could cause our product sales to fall below our expectations 
if our competitors develop more successful products  offer competitive products at lower price points  or if we do not continue to develop consistently high quality and well received products  our revenue  margins  and profitability will decline 
if we are unable to maintain or acquire licenses to intellectual property  we will publish fewer hit titles and our revenue  profitability and cash flows will decline 
competition for these licenses may make them more expensive  and increase our costs 
many of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others 
for example  our ea sports products include rights licensed from major sports leagues and players associations 
similarly  many of our hit ea games tm franchises  such as bond  harry potter and lord of the rings  are based on key film and literary licenses 
competition for these licenses is intense 
if we are unable to maintain these licenses and obtain additional licenses with significant commercial value  our revenues and profitability will decline significantly 
competition for these licenses may also drive up the advances  guarantees and royalties that we must pay to the licensor  which could significantly increase our costs 
if patent claims continue to be asserted against us  we may be unable to sustain our current business models or profits 
many patents have been issued that may apply to widely used game technologies 
additionally  infringement claims under many recently issued patents are now being asserted against internet implementations of existing games 
several such claims have been asserted against us 
such claims can harm our business 
we incur substantial expenses in evaluating and defending against such claims  regardless of the merits of the claims 
in the event that there is a determination that we have infringed a third party patent  we could incur significant monetary liability and be prevented from using the rights in the future  which could negatively impact our operating results 
other intellectual property claims may increase our product costs or require us to cease selling affected products 
many of our products include extremely realistic graphical images  and we expect that as technology continues to advance  images will become even more realistic 
some of the images and other content are based on real world examples that may inadvertently infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others 
although we believe that we make reasonable efforts to ensure that our products do not violate the intellectual property rights of others  it is possible that third parties still may claim infringement 
from time to time  we receive communications from third parties regarding such claims 
existing or future infringement claims against us  whether valid or not  may be time consuming and expensive to defend 
such claims or litigations could require us to stop selling the affected products  redesign those products to avoid infringement  or obtain a license  all of which would be costly and harm our business 

table of contents from time to time we may become involved in other litigation which could adversely affect us 
we are currently  and from time to time in the future may become  subject to other claims and litigation  which could be expensive  lengthy  and disruptive to normal business operations 
in addition  the outcome of any claims or litigation may be difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  or financial condition 
for further information regarding certain claims and litigation in which we are currently involved  see part i item legal proceedings above 
our business  our products and our distribution are subject to increasing regulation of content  consumer privacy and online delivery in the key territories in which we conduct business 
if we do not successfully respond to these regulations  our business may suffer 
legislation is continually being introduced that may affect both the content of our products and their distribution 
for example  privacy laws in the united states and europe impose various restrictions on our web sites 
those rules vary by territory although the internet recognizes no geographical boundaries 
other countries  such as germany  have adopted laws regulating content both in packaged goods and those transmitted over the internet that are stricter than current united states laws 
in the united states  the federal and several state governments are considering content restrictions on products such as ours  as well as restrictions on distribution of such products 
any one or more of these factors could harm our business by limiting the products we are able to offer to our customers and by requiring additional differentiation between products for different territories to address varying regulations 
this additional product differentiation would be costly 
if we do not continue to attract and retain key personnel  we will be unable to effectively conduct our business 
in addition  compensation related changes in accounting requirements  in addition to evolving legal and operational factors  could have a significant impact on our expenses and operating results 
the market for technical  creative  marketing and other personnel essential to the development and marketing of our products and management of our businesses is extremely competitive 
our leading position within the interactive entertainment industry makes us a prime target for recruiting of executives and key creative talent 
if we cannot successfully recruit and retain the employees we need  or replace key employees following their departure  our ability to develop and manage our businesses will be impaired 
we annually review and evaluate with the compensation committee of our board of directors the compensation and benefits that we offer our employees to ensure that we are able to attract and retain our talent 
within our regular review  we have considered recent changes in the accounting treatment of stock options  the competitive market for technical  creative  marketing and other personnel  and the evolving nature of job functions within our studios  marketing organizations and other areas of the business 
any changes we make to our compensation programs could result in increased expenses and have a significant impact on our operating results 
our platform licensors are our chief competitors and frequently control the manufacturing of and or access to our video game products 
if they do not approve our products  we will be unable to ship to our customers 
our agreements with hardware licensors such as sony for the playstation  microsoft for the xbox and nintendo for the nintendo gamecube typically give significant control to the licensor over the approval and manufacturing of our products  which could  in certain circumstances  leave us unable to get our products approved  manufactured and shipped to customers 
these hardware licensors are also our chief competitors 
in most events  control of the approval and manufacturing process by the platform licensors increases both our manufacturing lead times and costs as compared to those we can achieve independently 
while we believe that our relationships with our hardware licensors are currently good  the potential for these licensors to delay or refuse to approve or manufacture our products exists 
such occurrences would harm our business and our financial performance 
we also require compatibility code and the consent of microsoft and sony in order to include online capabilities in our products for their respective platforms 
as online capabilities for video game platforms 
table of contents become more significant  microsoft and sony could restrict our ability to provide online capabilities for our console platform products 
if microsoft or sony refused to approve our products with online capabilities or significantly impacted the financial terms on which these services are offered to our customers  our business could be harmed 
our international net revenue is subject to currency fluctuations 
for the fiscal year ended march   international net revenue comprised percent of our total net revenue 
we expect foreign sales to continue to account for a significant portion of our total net revenue 
such sales are subject to unexpected regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers 
additionally  foreign sales are primarily made in local currencies  which may fluctuate against the us dollar 
while we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate some foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities primarily certain intercompany receivables and payables and from time to time  foreign currency option contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted transactions primarily related to a portion of the revenue generated by our operational subsidiaries  our results of operations  including our reported net revenue and net income  and financial condition would be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations  particularly the euro and pound sterling 
changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and  in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we are also required to estimate what our taxes will be in the future 
although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable  the estimate process is inherently uncertain  and our estimates are not binding on tax authorities 
our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in our business  including the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates  changes in the elections we make  changes in applicable tax laws as well as other factors 
further  our tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision 
should our ultimate tax liability exceed our estimates  our income tax provision and net income could be materially affected 
we are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes  such as payroll  sales  use  value added  net worth  property and goods and services taxes  in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
we are regularly under examination by tax authorities with respect to these non income taxes 
there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations  changes in our business or changes in applicable tax rules will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
changes in our worldwide operating structure could have adverse tax consequences 
we are in the process of examining our worldwide operating structure in light of changing tax laws  our current and anticipated business operations  and the pending expiration of an offshore advance pricing agreements with a foreign tax authority in december under which our current business operates 
certain changes that we are considering  or a failure to make certain other changes  to our operating structure would increase our tax expense 
in addition  while our current intention is to invest indefinitely our undistributed foreign earnings offshore  we are in the process of evaluating whether we will change our intentions regarding a portion of our foreign earnings and take advantage of the repatriation provision of the jobs act  and if so  the amount that we would intend to repatriate 
we may decide not to take advantage of the new law at all 
in addition to not having made a decision to repatriate any foreign earnings  we are not yet in a position to determine the impact of a qualifying repatriation  should we choose to make one  on our income tax expense for fiscal 
table of contents our reported financial results could be adversely affected by changes in financial accounting standards or by the application of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it evolves 
as a result of the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act and the review of accounting policies by the sec and national and international accounting standards bodies  the frequency of accounting policy changes may accelerate 
for example  the fasb has issued a new standard that will require us to adopt a different method of determining and accounting for the compensation expense of our employee stock options 
this and other possible changes to accounting standards  could adversely affect our reported results of operations although not necessarily our cash flows 
further  accounting policies affecting software revenue recognition have been the subject of frequent interpretations  which could significantly affect the way we account for revenue related to our products 
as we enhance  expand and diversify our business and product offerings  the application of existing or future financial accounting standards  particularly those relating to the way we account for revenue  could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows 
the majority of our sales are made to a relatively small number of key customers 
if these customers reduce their purchases of our products or become unable to pay for them  our business could be harmed 
in the us  in fiscal  over percent of our us sales were made to six key customers  two of which have recently announced plans to merge 
in europe  our top ten customers accounted for over percent of our sales in that territory in fiscal worldwide  we had direct sales to one customer  wal mart stores  inc  which represented percent of total net revenue in fiscal though our products are available to consumers through a variety of retailers  the concentration of our sales in one  or a few  large customers could lead to a short term disruption in our sales if one or more of these customers significantly reduced their purchases or ceased to carry our products  and could make us more vulnerable to collection risk if one or more of these large customers became unable to pay for our products 
additionally  our receivables from these large customers increase significantly in the december quarter as they stock up for the holiday selling season 
also  having such a large portion of our total net revenue concentrated in a few customers reduces our negotiating leverage with these customers 
acquisitions  investments and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties  dilution to our investors and other negative consequences 
we have evaluated  and expect to continue to evaluate  a wide array of potential strategic transactions  including acquisitions of companies  businesses  intellectual properties  and other assets  and investments in new interactive entertainment businesses for example  online and mobile games 
any of these strategic transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations 
although we regularly search for opportunities to engage in strategic transactions  we may not be successful in identifying suitable opportunities 
we may not be able to consummate potential acquisitions or investments or an acquisition or investment may not enhance our business or may decrease rather than increase our earnings 
in addition  the process of integrating an acquired company or business  or successfully exploiting acquired intellectual property or other assets  could divert a significant amount of our management s time and focus and may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures 
additional risks we face include the need to implement or remediate controls  procedures and policies appropriate for a public company in an acquired company that  prior to the acquisition  lacked these controls  procedures and policies  cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from an acquired company or business into our organization  retaining key employees from the businesses we acquire  the need to integrate an acquired company s accounting  management information  human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management  and to the extent that we engage in strategic transactions outside of the united states  we face additional risks  including risks related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages  currency risks and the particular economic  political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries 

table of contents future acquisitions and investments could involve the issuance of our equity securities  potentially diluting our existing stockholders  the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities or amortization expenses  or write offs of goodwill  any of which could harm our financial condition 
our stockholders may not have the opportunity to review  vote on or evaluate future acquisitions or investments 
our products are subject to the threat of piracy by a variety of organizations and individuals 
if we are not successful in combating and preventing piracy  our sales and profitability could be harmed significantly 
in many countries around the world  more pirated copies of our products are sold than legitimate copies 
though piracy has not had a material impact on our operating results to date  highly organized pirate operations have been expanding globally 
in addition  the proliferation of technology designed to circumvent the protection measures we use in our products  the availability of broadband access to the internet  the ability to download pirated copies of our games from various internet sites  and the widespread proliferation of internet cafes using pirated copies of our products  all have contributed to ongoing and expanding piracy 
though we take steps to make the unauthorized copying and distribution of our products more difficult  as do the manufacturers of consoles on which our games are played  neither our efforts nor those of the console manufacturers may be successful in controlling the piracy of our products 
this could have a negative effect on our growth and profitability in the future 
our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly 
the market price of our common stock historically has been  and we expect will continue to be  subject to significant fluctuations 
these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us including those discussed in the risk factors above as well as others not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material  to changes in securities analysts earnings estimates  to our results falling below the expectations of analysts and investors  to factors affecting the computer  software  internet  entertainment  media or electronics industries  or to national or international economic conditions 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and market prices 
market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and market prices 
foreign currency option and foreign exchange forward contracts are used to either hedge anticipated exposures or mitigate some existing exposures subject to market risk 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk is the potential loss arising from changes in interest rates and credit ratings 
we do not consider our cash and cash equivalents to be exposed to significant interest rate risk because our portfolio consists of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less see note to the consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency exchange rate risk from time to time  we hedge some of our foreign currency risk related to anticipated foreign currency denominated sales transactions by purchasing option contracts that generally have maturities of months or less 
these transactions are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges 
the derivative assets associated with our hedging activities are recorded at fair value in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of any tax effects  in stockholders equity and subsequently reclassified into net revenue in the period when the forecasted transaction actually occurs 
the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value is reported in interest and other income  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
our hedging programs reduce  but do not entirely 
table of contents eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements 
the fair value of our foreign currency option contracts purchased and included in other current assets was million as of both march  and we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  primarily intercompany receivables and payables 
the forward contracts generally have a contractual term of less than one month and are transacted near month end 
therefore  the fair value of the forward contracts generally is not significant at each month end 
our foreign exchange forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no 
and are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts are reported as other current assets or other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets  and gains and losses from changes in fair value are reported in interest and other income  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
the gains and losses on these forward contracts generally offset the gains and losses on the underlying foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
as of march  we had foreign exchange contracts to purchase and sell approximately million of foreign currencies 
of this amount  million represents contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars  million to sell foreign currencies in exchange for british pounds  and million to purchase foreign currency in exchange for us dollars 
as of march  we had foreign exchange contracts to purchase and sell approximately million of foreign currencies 
of this amount  million represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars and million to sell foreign currency for british pounds 
the fair value of our forward contracts was approximately and million as of march  and  respectively 
the counterparties to these forward and option contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks 
the risks of counterparty nonperformance associated with these contracts are not considered to be material 
notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risks  there can be no assurances that our mitigating activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
for example  a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of percent or percent would not result in a material loss in fair value of our option contracts under either scenario as of march  or a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of percent or percent would result in potential losses on our forward contracts of million and million  respectively  as of march   and million and million  respectively  as of march  this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel adverse shift in foreign currency exchange rates  which do not always move in the same direction 
actual results may differ materially 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short average maturities 
additionally  the contractual terms of the securities do not permit the issuer to call  prepay or otherwise settle the securities at prices less that the stated par value of the securities 
we also do not use derivative financial instruments in our short term investment portfolio 
as of march  and  our short term investments were classified as available for sale and  consequently  recorded at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of any tax effects  
table of contents in stockholders equity 
our portfolio of short term investments consists of the following investment categories  summarized by fair value as of march  and in millions as of march  us government agencies us government bonds corporate bonds asset backed securities total short term investments notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks  there can be no assurances that we will be adequately protected against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
at any time  a sharp rise in interest rates could have a significant adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value in our short term investment portfolio as of march   arising from selected potential changes in interest rates

therefore  we have changed our quantitative disclosures of interest rate risk from the tabular presentation used in prior years to the sensitivity analysis  presented above  as we believe this methodology better illustrates the effects on our portfolio caused by our primary risk of changes in interest rates 
we have not presented a similar sensitivity analysis for fiscal because of the relatively insignificant amount of short term investments in fiscal versus fiscal market price risk the values of our equity investments in publicly traded companies are subject to market price volatility 
as of march   our marketable equity securities were classified as available for sale and  consequently  were recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of any tax effects  in stockholders equity 
the fair value of our marketable equity securities was million and million as of march  and  respectively 

table of contents at any time  a sharp decrease in market prices in our investments in marketable equity securities could have a significant adverse impact on the fair value of our investments

hypothetical changes in market prices of the same magnitude would not have resulted in material changes in fair value of our marketable equity securities as of march  and  accordingly  are not presented
