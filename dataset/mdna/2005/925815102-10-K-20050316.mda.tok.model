the products power systems are incorporated into virtually all electronic products  such as computers and telecommunications equipment  to convert electric power from a primary source  for example a wall outlet or battery source  into the stable dc voltages required by electronic circuits 
because power systems are arranged in a myriad of application specific configurations  the company s basic strategy is to exploit the density and performance advantages of its technology by offering comprehensive families of economical  component level building blocks which can be used to configure a power system specific to a user s needs 
in addition to component level power converters  which serve as modular power system building blocks  the company also manufactures and sells complete configurable power systems  accessory products  and custom power solutions 
the company operates in one industry segment the development  manufacture and sale of power conversion components and systems 
the company s principal product lines include modular power converters the company currently offers four first generation families of component level dc dc power converters the vi  vi j  mi  and mi j families 
designed to be mounted directly on a printed circuit board assembly and soldered in place using contemporary manufacturing processes  each family comprises a comprehensive set of products which are offered in a wide range of input voltage  output voltage and power ratings 
this allows end users to select products appropriate to their individual applications 
the product families differ in maximum power ratings  performance characteristics  package size and  in certain cases  in target market 
since  the company has introduced four families of its second generation of high power density  component level dc dc converters 
in  the volt input family was introduced  which was designed for the telecommunications market as well as for distributed power systems 
the products consist of modules with the most popular output voltages in all three of the company s second generation standard packages the full size maxi  the half size mini and the quarter size micro 
output power levels from to watts are covered by these second generation products 
in  this was followed by two additional families a volt input for off line rectified or volt ac and distributed power applications  and a volt input specifically designed for use in power factor corrected systems 
this latter family increased the power available to watts 
in  a volt input family was added to the standard second generation product line to address additional telecommunications  industrial and defense market opportunities 
the vicor design assistance computer vdac was introduced for general use in and is a proprietary system which enables vicor s customers to specify on line  and verify in real time  the performance and attributes of second generation dc dc converters

the vcad system enables the design of a custom configured vipac product from all available combinations of inputs  outputs  chassis and optional features 
factorized power architecture in april  the company announced the introduction of a new power system architecture based on an array of proprietary power conversion technologies called factorized power architecture fpa 
the company believes fpa will provide power system designers with enhanced performance at a lower cost than attained with conventional distributed power architecture dpa 
factorized power maximizes the competitiveness of a power system with a high degree of systems flexibility  power density  conversion efficiency  transient responsiveness  noise performance and reliability 
fpa is enabled by power conversion components called v i chips or vics 
v i chips deliver up to watts of power in a surface mount smd ball grid array bga or j lead package occupying less than cubic inch of space  with power densities of  watts per cubic inch  which represents a seven to eight times improvement over the company s second generation products 
in may  the company introduced the first family of products based on this new technology  volt to volt bus converter modules bcm for conventional intermediate bus architecture applications 
in july  the company introduced its first v i chip tm voltage transformation module vtm 
vtms are designed to meet the demands of advanced digital signal processors dsp  field programmable gate arrays fpga  application specific integrated circuits asic  processor cores and microprocessor applications at the point of load pol while providing isolation from input to output 
they may be paralleled to deliver hundreds of amperes 
in january  the company announced the availability of the first members of its volt intermediate bus converter modules ibcs 
offered in standard brick format and operating from a volt dc input  the ibc family consists of ten fixed ratio standard models with nominal outputs from to volt dc delivering up to amperes or watts 

table of contents additional vtm and bcm products were introduced throughout at electronica  a major electronics show and exposition held every other year in munich  germany  the company introduced a new v i chip based product called the vicbrick 
this consists of a new class of vic  the pre regulator module prm  coupled with a vtm and mounted on an industry standard brick format printed circuit board 
the prm provides the regulation function and  when combined with the vtm  enables tight control of the voltage delivered to the load 
the vicbrick replicates the functionality of standard brick dc dc converters while offering the benefits of fpa in a familiar and widely adopted package 
accessory power system components accessory power system components  used with the company s component level power converters  integrate other important functions of the power system  facilitating the design of complete power systems by interconnecting several modules 
in general  accessory products are used to condition the inputs and outputs of the company s modular power components 
vi hams harmonic attenuator modules are universal ac input  power factor correcting front ends for use with compatible power converters 
vi aims ac input modules provide input filtering  transient protection and rectification of the ac line 
vi iams input attenuator modules provide the dc input filtering and transient protection required in industrial and telecommunications markets 
vi rams ripple attenuator modules condition converter module outputs for extremely low noise systems

customer specific products since its inception  the company has accepted a certain amount of custom power supply business 
in most cases  the customer was unable to obtain a conventional solution that could achieve the desired level of performance in the available space 
by utilizing its component level power products as core elements in developing most of these products  the company was able to meet the customer s needs with a reliable  high power density  total solution 
however  in keeping with the company s strategy of focusing on sales of standard families of component level power building blocks  custom product sales have not been directly pursued 
the company has traditionally pursued these custom opportunities through value added resellers vars and a network of vias see part i  item business the company 
most of the vias are majority owned by the company  while vars are independent businesses 
both vias and vars are distributed geographically and are in close proximity to many of their customers

incoming components  assemblies and other parts are subjected to several levels of inspection procedures 

table of contents compliance by the company with applicable environmental laws has not had a material effect on the financial condition or operations of the company 
second generation automated manufacturing line revenues of second generation products increased by in over  unit production increased  and orders increased 
both first and second generation products are sold to similar customers 
gross margins on second generation products continue to be significantly lower than those of first generation products  principally due to high depreciation expense associated with second generation manufacturing equipment 
the company made progress in with the process of converting second generation products to a new fastrak platform 
this involved the installation of new automated manufacturing equipment  which has been completed  and the qualification of all products converted over to the new platform  which is still in process 
while the conversion of the pre defined matrix of second generation products is substantially complete  the conversion of customer defined products is ongoing 
the company believes that this conversion will ultimately result in lower unit costs and improved manufacturing yields 
while there was modest improvement in second generation gross margins in  gross margins during will continue to be negatively impacted unless and until the company is able to achieve higher production volumes and attain higher yield levels and component cost reductions on second generation products 
the company continues to actively work towards improving yields and reducing the cost of components on second generation products 
there can be no assurance that such volumes  yields or cost reductions can be attained 
competition the power conversion industry is highly competitive 
many power supply manufacturers target markets similar to those of the company

the claims in the reissue patent cover non coincident active clamp technology in a broadly defined class of single ended forward converters and enable design of power converters which are smaller and more energy efficient than conventional power supplies 
the claims cover  but are not limited to  so called zero voltage switching technology 
the company believes that its rights under the reset patent and the reissue patent have been infringed 
the company intends to vigorously protect its rights under its patents see part i  item legal proceedings 

table of contents the company has been issued patents in the united states which expire between and  in europe which expire between and  and in japan which expire between and 
the company also has a number of patent applications pending in the united states  europe and the far east 
although the company believes that patents are an effective way of protecting its technology  there can be no assurances that the company s patents will prove to be enforceable see  eg  part i  item legal proceedings 
while some of the company s patents are deemed materially important to the company s operations  the company believes that no one patent is essential to the success of the company 
licensing in addition to generating revenue from product sales  licensing is an element of the company s strategy for building worldwide product and technology acceptance and market share 
in granting licenses  the company generally retains the right to use its patented technologies  and manufacture and sell its products  in all licensed geographic areas and fields of use 
licenses are granted and administered through the company s wholly owned subsidiary  vlt  inc  which owns the company s patents 
revenues from licensing arrangements have not exceeded of the company s consolidated revenues in any of the last three fiscal years

actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of  among other factors  the risk factors set forth below 

table of contents our future success depends upon our ability to develop and market leading edge  cost effective products 
the power supply industry and the industries in which many of our customers operate are characterized by intense competition  rapid technological change  product obsolescence and price erosion for mature products  each of which could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the failure of the company to continue to develop and commercialize leading edge technologies and products that are cost effective and maintain high standards of quality could have a material adverse affect on the company s competitive position and results of operations 
specifically  the company may not be successful in leveraging the v i chips in standard products to promote market acceptance of factorized power 
our future operating results are dependent on the growth in our customers businesses 
the company manufactures modular power components and power systems that are incorporated into its customers electronic products 
the company s growth is therefore dependent on the growth in the sales of its customers products as well as the development by its customers of new products 
the failure of the company to anticipate changes in our customers businesses and their changing product needs could negatively impact our financial position 
our conversion of second generation products to the fastrak platform may not progress as planned 
the company made progress in with the process of converting second generation products to a new fastrak platform 
this involved the installation of new automated manufacturing equipment  which has been completed  and the qualification of all products converted over to the new platform  which is still in process 
while the conversion of the pre defined matrix of second generation products is substantially complete  the conversion of customer defined products is ongoing 
the company believes that this conversion will ultimately result in lower unit costs and improved manufacturing yields  while supporting the worldwide restriction of hazardous substances rohs initiative 
there can be no assurance that the qualification of remaining products will be completed as scheduled or that the expected results of the conversion of second generation products to the fastrak platform will be achieved 
in addition  the process of conversion could result in excess supplies of raw materials that are no longer needed for the converted products 
additional inventory reserves could be required for potentially slow moving or obsolete inventory which could negatively impact the company s future operating results 
also  once the conversion is completed  certain second generation automated manufacturing equipment may have little or no future use 
this may result in the impairment of any remaining net book value of those assets 
during the second and third quarters of  the useful lives of certain equipment in connection with the conversion were shortened  which resulted in higher depreciation expense on this equipment in our revenues may not increase enough to offset the expense of additional capacity 
the company has made significant additions to its manufacturing equipment and capacity over the past several years  including equipment for the new fastrak platform 
if revenue levels do not increase enough to offset the increased fixed costs or if there is deterioration in the company s business  the company s future operating results could be adversely affected 
in addition  asset values could be impaired if the additional capacity is underutilized for an extended period of time 
we rely on third party suppliers and subcontractors for components and assemblies and  therefore  cannot control their availability or quality 
the company depends on third party suppliers and subcontractors to provide components and assemblies used in our products 
if suppliers or subcontractors cannot provide their products or services on time or to our specifications  the company may not be able to meet the demand for its products  or it may negatively affect delivery times 
in addition  the company cannot directly control the quality of the products and services provided by third parties 
in order to grow  the company may need to find new or 
table of contents change existing suppliers and subcontractors 
this could cause disruptions in production  delays in the shipping of product or increases in prices paid to third parties 
we are exposed to economic  political and other risks through our foreign sales and distributors 
international sales have been and are expected to be a significant component of total sales 
dependence on foreign third parties for sales and distribution is subject to special risks  such as foreign economic and political instability  foreign currency controls and market fluctuations  trade barriers and tariffs  foreign regulations and exchange rates 
sudden or unexpected changes in the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
our ability to successfully implement our business strategy may be limited if we do not retain our key personnel 
the company s success depends on our ability to retain the services of our executive officers 
the loss of one or more members of senior management could materially adversely affect the company s business and financial results 
in particular  the company is dependent on the services of dr 
patrizio vinciarelli  its founder  chairman  president and chief executive officer 
the loss of the services of dr 
vinciarelli could have a material adverse effect on the company s development of new products and on its results of operations 
in addition  the company depends on highly skilled engineers and other personnel with technical skills that are in high demand and are difficult to replace 
the company s continued operations and growth depends on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees in a very competitive employment market 
we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights  which may limit our ability to compete effectively 
the company operates in an industry in which the ability to compete depends on the development or acquisition of proprietary technologies which must be protected to preserve the exclusive use of such technologies 
the company devotes substantial resources to establish and protect our patents and proprietary rights  and the company relies on patent and intellectual property law to protect such rights 
this protection  however  may not prevent competitors from independently developing products similar or superior to the company s products 
the company may be unable to protect or enforce current patents  may rely on unpatented technology that competitors could restrict  or may be unable to acquire patents in the future  and this may have a material adverse affect on the company s competitive position 
in addition  the intellectual property laws of foreign countries may not protect the company s rights to the same extent as those of the united states 
the company has been and may need to continue to defend or challenge patents 
the company has incurred and expects to incur significant costs in and devote significant resources to these efforts which  if unsuccessful  may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial position 
our revenues and operating results have been negatively impacted by the general business slowdown  and our outlook going forward remains highly uncertain 
the company is exposed to general economic conditions which could have a material adverse impact on its business  operating results and financial condition 
as a result of the continued general economic slowdown in the major electronics markets  particularly in the communications markets  the company s net revenues in  while up approximately and as compared to and  respectively  are still significantly less than revenues in the company remains uncertain whether there will be any significant improvement in general economic conditions in  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in managing our expenses in light of customer demand 

table of contents compliance with the european union restriction of hazardous substances rohs may not proceed as planned 
the company has elected to comply with the european union s eu directive on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment  referred to as rohs or as the lead free directive 
the company has established a formal plan to make vicor products compliant with this directive ahead of the designated july  deadline 
compliance will involve working with certain suppliers and customers  may potentially require the redesign of certain products and may require the modification of certain manufacturing processes 
as a result  the following situations could negatively impact our results of operations suppliers cannot meet the new requirements or meet the specified deadlines  and the company may not be able to meet the demand for its products  or it may negatively affect delivery times 
customers mandate that their suppliers comply with the rohs directive at an earlier date than july   and the company may not be able to meet their requirements 
customers mandate that they will not accept rohs directive compliant product  and such requirements could significantly increase the cost of maintaining business with these customers 
the redesign of products may not proceed as planned  or may be determined to not be feasible for certain products 
the modification of manufacturing processes may require the additional investment in equipment  which will increase operating expenses 
the conversion over to compliant materials could result in excess supplies of raw materials that are no longer needed for non compliant products 
additional inventory reserves could be required for such excess materials

the lawsuit against lucent was filed in may and the lawsuits against the other defendants were filed in february and march in january  the district court issued a pre trial decision in each of these patent infringement lawsuits and a patent infringement lawsuit that was pending against power one  inc  
table of contents relating to claim construction of the reset patent 
the district court s decisions rejected assertions that the reset patent claims are invalid for indefiniteness  and affirmed vicor s interpretation of several terms used in the reset patent claims 
however  the district court adopted interpretations of certain terms of the reset patent claims that are contrary to vicor s position 
on may   the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmed the decisions issued in january by the district court 
vicor believes that the district court s decisions  and the affirmation of these decisions by the federal circuit  strengthens its position regarding validity of the patent  but reduces the cumulative amount of infringing power supplies and the corresponding amount of potential damages 
the federal circuit has referred the proceedings back to the district court for trials on validity of the reset patent and infringement and damages by the defendants 
the district court has not yet set dates for these trials 
there can be no assurance that vicor and vlt will ultimately prevail with respect to any of these claims or  if they prevail  as to the amount of damages that would be awarded

this table and the subsequent discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements of the company contained elsewhere in this report 
year ended december  net revenues gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses loss before income taxes critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgements  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  impairment of long lived assets  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgements on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following accounting policies involve its more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts vicor maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments  based on assessments of customers credit risk profiles and payment histories 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents inventories the company estimates allowances for its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory based upon its known backlog and historical usage  and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
while we have used our best efforts and believe we have used the best available information to estimate future demand  due to uncertainty in the economy and our business and the inherent difficulty in predicting future demand  it is possible that actual demand for our products will differ from our estimates 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves for existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods 
long lived assets management evaluates the recoverability of the company s identifiable intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas  which generally requires that the recoverability of these assets be assessed when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
the company periodically assesses the remaining use of fixed assets based upon operating results and cash flows from operations 
equipment has been written down as a result of these assessments as necessary 
goodwill is tested for potential impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level 
deterioration or changes in the company s business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods 
warranty the company generally warrants its products for a period of two years 
vicor maintains allowances for estimated product returns under warranty based upon a review of known or potential product failures in the field and upon historical patterns of product returns 
if unforeseen product issues arise or product returns increase above expected rates  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes fas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
fas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company has assessed the need for a valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance for a portion of the deferred tax assets is warranted at december  in reaching this conclusion  the company evaluated all relevant criteria including the existence of significant temporary differences reversing in the carryforward period  primarily depreciation 
the valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets may require adjustment in the future based on changes in the mix of temporary differences  changes in tax laws  and operating performance 
in addition  the assessment of the valuation allowance requires the company to make estimates of future taxable income and to estimate reversals of temporary differences 
changes in the assumptions or other circumstances may require additional valuation allowances if actual reversals of temporary differences differ from those estimates 
the company operates in numerous taxing jurisdictions and is  therefore  subject to a variety of income and related taxes 
the company has provided for potential tax liabilities due in various jurisdictions which it judges to be probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for contingencies 
judgment is required in determining the income tax expense and related tax liabilities 
in the ordinary course of business  there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
the company believes it has 
table of contents reasonably estimated its accrued taxes for all jurisdictions for all open tax periods 
the company periodically assesses the adequacy of its tax and related accruals on a quarterly basis and adjusts appropriately as events warrant and open tax periods close 
it is possible that the final tax outcome of these matters will be different from management s estimate reflected in the income tax provisions and accrued taxes 
such differences could have a material impact on the company s income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made
