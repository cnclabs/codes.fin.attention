item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction mutualfirst financial  inc  a maryland corporation  is a savings and loan holding company  which has as its wholly owned subsidiary  mutual federal savings bank  muncie  indiana 
mfs financial  inc was formed in september to become the holding company of mutual federal in connection with mutual federal s conversion from the mutual to stock form of organization on december  in april  mfs financial  inc formally changed its corporate name to mutualfirst financial  inc mutualfirst 
the words we  our and us refer to mutualfirst and mutual federal on a consolidated basis  except that references to us prior to december  refer only to mutual federal 
on march   mutual federal announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to purchase assets and assume liabilities representing the operations of fidelity federal savings bank of marion  indiana 
mutual federal will pay million in cash for these net assets  subject to adjustment 
fidelity federal savings bank is a subsidiary of first financial bancorp 
the acquisition  which is subject to regulatory approval  is expected to close during the third quarter of our principal business consists of attracting retail deposits from the general public and investing those funds primarily in permanent loans secured by first mortgages on owner occupied  one to four family residences  a variety of consumer loans  loans secured by commercial and multi family real estate and commercial business loans 
we are headquartered in muncie  indiana with retail offices primarily serving delaware  randolph  kosciusko  and grant counties in indiana 
we also originate mortgage loans in contiguous counties  and we originate indirect consumer loans throughout indiana 
the following discussion is intended to assist your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements 
our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  which principally consist of loans and mortgage backed and investment securities  and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  which principally consist of deposits and borrowings 
our results of operations also are affected by the level of our non interest income and expenses and income tax expense 

next page management strategy our strategy is to operate as an independent  retail oriented financial institution dedicated to serving customers in our market areas 
our commitment is to provide a broad range of products and services to meet the needs of our customers 
as part of this commitment  we are looking to increase our emphasis on commercial business products and services 
we also operate a fully interactive transactional website 
in addition  we are continually looking at cost effective ways to expand our market area 
financial highlights of our strategy include continuing as a diversified lender 
we have been successful in diversifying our loan portfolio to reduce our reliance on any one type of loan 
from through approximately of our loan portfolio consisted of loans other than one to four family real estate loans 
since that time to the end of  that percentage has increased to continuing as a leading one to four family lender 
we are one of the largest originators of one to four family residential loans in our four county market area 
during  we originated million of one to four family residential loans 
continuing to focus on asset quality 
non performing assets to total assets was 
at december   in line with our regional peer group 
we are confident that our underwriting standards will continue to provide for a quality loan portfolio 
continuing our strong capital position 
as a result of our consistent profitability  we have historically maintained a strong capital position 
at december   our ratio of stockholders equity to total assets was 
financial condition at december  compared to december  general 
our total assets increased million during  ending the year at million compared to million at december   primarily due to increases in loans and investments 
liabilities increased million due to increased deposits and borrowings 
stockholders equity decreased to million as stock repurchases and dividends totaling million were partially offset by net income of million 
loans 
our net loan portfolio increased million from million at december   to million at december  consumer loans increased million or from million at december  to million at december  most of the consumer loan growth came from home equity and home improvements loans  which increased million or from million to million and auto loans  which increased million or from million to million 

next page commercial business loans increased million or from million to million at december  it has been our strategy to increase non real estate mortgage loans as a percentage of our loan portfolio in order to mitigate interest rate risk and enhance the portfolio yield 
accordingly  we sold million of our fixed rate one to four family mortgage loans in as a result  real estate mortgage loans decreased million or 
from million to million at december  mortgage loans held for sale increased  allowance for loan loss 
the allowance for loan loss increased to million at december  from million at december   an increase of  or 
net charge offs were million during  as compared to net charge offs of  for this  along with a million loan loss provision during  resulted in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans remaining stable at 
at december  when comparing to december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non performing loans was and at december  and december   respectively 
non performing loans were million or 
of total loans at december  compared to million or 
at december  the increase in the allowance for loan losses was due to continued poor economic conditions in some of our markets  the increase in the portfolio risk due to the increased percentage of consumer and commercial loans in the portfolio and the increases in loan balances 
see critical accounting policies 
securities 
investment securities amounted to million at december  compared to million at december   a increase 
this increase was primarily due to the lack of anticipated loan growth and the resultant excess liquidity 
liabilities 
our total liabilities increased million or to million at december  from million at december  this increase was due primarily to an increase in deposits of million  and an increase in borrowed funds of million to provide funding for stock repurchases and to fund loan and investment growth 
stockholders equity 
stockholders equity decreased million from million at december  to million at december  the decrease was due primarily to the repurchase of  shares of mutualfirst common stock at a cost of million and dividend payments of million 
these decreases were partially offset by net income of million  employee stock ownership plan esop shares earned of  rrp shares earned including tax benefits of  and stock options exercised for  also  the unrealized gain on the market value of securities available for sale compared to their book value decreased  from a gain of  at december  to a loss of  at december  average balances  net interest income  yields earned and rates paid the following table presents for the periods indicated the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest earning assets and the resultant yields  as well as the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  expressed both in dollars and rates

next page net interest income 
interest income decreased million  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  interest expense decreased million  or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a result  net interest income decreased  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to a lower net interest margin and a lower volume of net earning assets 
the net interest margin decreased from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  as yields on interest earning assets decreased at a more rapid rate than the decrease in the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
interest income 
the decrease in interest income during the year ended december  was due to a reduction in the average yield on our earning assets from in to in as a result of lower market interest rates and payoffs of older higher rate loans 
this decrease was partially offset by a million increase in average earning assets from million during to million during the majority of this increase was in average loans receivable  which increased million from in to million in the average yield on these loans decreased basis points from in to in interest expense 
the decrease in interest expense was due to a basis point reduction in the cost of our average interest bearing liabilities from in to in as a result of lower market interest rates

we continue to experience poor  while improving  economic conditions in some of our markets and continue to change our portfolio mix to more non mortgage related loans 
however  the overriding reasons for the increase in the provision for loan losses in compared to were an increase in non performing loans and larger than anticipated charge offs during the year 
other income 
other income for the year ended december  increased slightly to million from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a  increase in service fee and commission income due to new checking account overdraft services and an addition to the non traditional financial services sales force 
also  the limited partnerships experienced a gain of  in compared to a  loss in due to increased occupancy rates 
these changes were partially offset by a decrease in loan sale gains of  due to fewer mortgage originations in when compared to the refinance activity in also  there was a smaller increase in cash surrender value of life insurance of  in when compared to due the collection of life insurance proceeds upon the death of a former director in  with no similar event occurring in 
next page other expense 
total operating expenses increased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for salaries and employee benefits were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the period  an increase of million or 
the primary reason for the increase was the one time million expense associated with the separation agreement announced in november 
also adding to operating expenses for was a more aggressive marketing effort to promote loans and short term core deposits and the opening of our eighteenth branch office in warsaw 
the costs associated with the separation agreement mentioned above and compliance issues related to the sarbanes oxley legislation increased professional fees  or in when compared to atm expenses were up  or due primarily to new card issuances that take place approximately every other year and the addition of an atm at the new branch location 
other expenses increased  due to increased postage  telephone  and other expenses primarily related to the new branch opening and regulatory compliance costs 
income tax expense 
for the year ended december   income tax expense decreased million compared to the decrease was due primarily to decreased taxable income

net interest income 
interest income decreased million  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  interest expense decreased million  or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a result  net interest income for the year ended december  was flat at million when compared to the previous year 
the average interest rate spread decreased slightly from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  interest income 
the decrease in interest income during the year ended december  was due to a reduction in the average yield on our earning assets from in to in as a result of lower market interest rates

other income 
other income for the year ended december  increased  from million the year ended december  to million for the year end december  this increase was due primarily to a decrease in our equity in losses on limited partnerships  which own various low income housing projects that provide federal income tax credits to its equity owners 
our share of the losses was  for the year ended december  compared to  the previous year 
another factor affecting the change in other income was a  increase in service fee income 
also  cash surrender values of life insurance improved  in compared to these changes were partially offset by a decrease in net servicing fees of  including a  third quarter valuation reserve for mortgage servicing rights

liquidity and commitments mutual federal is required to maintain adequate levels of investments that qualify as liquid assets under office of thrift supervision regulations to ensure the institution s safe and sound operations 
liquidity may increase or decrease depending upon the availability of funds and comparative yields on investments in relation 
next page to the return on loans 
historically  we have maintained liquid assets at levels above the minimum requirements imposed by office of thrift supervision regulations and above levels believed to be adequate to meet the requirements of normal operations  including potential deposit outflows 
cash flow projections are regularly reviewed and updated to ensure that adequate liquidity is maintained 
at december   our liquidity ratio  which is our liquid assets as a percentage of net withdrawable savings deposits and current borrowings  was 
our liquidity  represented by cash and cash equivalents and investment securities  is a product of our operating  investing and financing activities 
our primary sources of funds are deposits  amortization  prepayments and maturities of outstanding loans and mortgage backed securities  maturities of investment securities and other short term investments and funds provided from operations 
while scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and mortgage backed securities and maturing investment securities and short term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
in addition  we invest excess funds in short term interest earning assets  which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements 
we also generate cash through borrowings 
we utilize federal home loan bank advances to leverage our capital base and provide funds for our lending and investment activities  and to enhance out interest rate risk management 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
excess liquidity is generally invested in short term investments such as overnight deposits or us agency securities 
we use our sources of funds primarily to meet our ongoing commitments  to pay maturing certificates of deposit and savings withdrawals  to fund loan commitments and to maintain our portfolio of mortgage backed securities and investment securities 
at december   the total approved loan origination commitments outstanding amounted to million 
at the same date  the unadvanced portion of construction loans was million 
at december   unused lines of credit totaled million and outstanding letters of credit totaled million 
as of december   certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less totaled million  and investment and mortgage backed securities scheduled to mature in one year or less totaled million 
based on historical experience  management believes that a significant portion of maturing deposits will remain with us 
we anticipate that we will continue to have sufficient funds  through deposits and borrowings  to meet our current commitments

recent accounting pronouncements on december   the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position no 
 accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer sop 
sop requires acquired loans with poor credit quality to be recorded at fair value and prohibits carrying over or creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting for the loans 
sop also limits the yield that may be accreted to income 
sop applies to the purchase of an individual loan  a pool of loans  a group of loans  and loans acquired in a business combination 
sop is effective for loans acquired in fiscal years beginning after december  sop is not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
in march  the emerging issues task force eitf finalized and issued eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf 
eitf provides recognition and measurement guidance regarding when impairments of equity and debt securities are considered other than temporary requiring a charge to earnings  and also requires additional annual disclosures for investments in unrealized loss positions 
the additional annual disclosure requirements were previously issued by the eitf in november and were effective for the company for the year ended december  in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp eitf  which delays the recognition and measurement provisions of eitf pending the issuance of further implementation guidance 
we are currently evaluating the effect of the recognition and measurement provisions of eitf while our analysis is pending the fasb s revisions to eitf  we currently believe the adoption of eitf will not result in a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
in december   the fasb issued an amendment to sfas sfas r which eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
sfas r will be effective for the company beginning july  sfasr applies to all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after that date 
the cumulative effect of initially applying this statement  if any  is recognized as of the required effective date 

next page as of the required effective date  the company will apply sfas r using a modified version of prospective application 
under that transition method  compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under sfas for either recognition or pro forma disclosures 
for periods before the required effective date  a company may elect to apply a modified version of retrospective application under which financial statements for prior periods are adjusted on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods by sfas the company will first report compensation cost under sfas r in the third quarter of the company will initially measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award based on its current fair value  the fair value will be remeasured subsequently at each reporting date through the settlement date  and changes in fair value will be recognized as compensation cost 
we are currently evaluating the effect of the recognition and measurement provisions of sfas r but we currently believe the adoption of sfas r will not result in a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
critical accounting policies the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k contain a summary of mutualfirst s significant accounting policies 
certain of these policies are important to the portrayal of mutualfirst s financial condition  since they require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments  some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
management believes that its critical accounting policies include determining the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of foreclosed assets  mortgage servicing rights and real estate held for development and the valuation of intangible assets 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant changes in the economic environment and market conditions 
a worsening or protracted economic decline would increase the likelihood of additional losses due to credit and market risk and could create the need for additional loss reserves 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a significant estimate that can and does change based on management s assumptions about specific borrowers and current general economic and business conditions  among other factors 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on at least a quarterly basis 
the evaluation by management includes consideration of past loss experience  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  the current condition and amount of loans outstanding  identified problem loans and the probability of collecting all amounts due 

next page foreclosed assets foreclosed assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated selling costs 
management estimates the fair value of the properties based on current appraisal information 
fair value estimates are particularly susceptible to significant changes in the economic environment  market conditions  and real estate market 
a worsening or protracted economic decline would increase the likelihood of a decline in property values and could create the need to write down the properties through current operations 
mortgage servicing rights mortgage servicing rights msrs associated with loans originated and sold  where servicing is retained  are capitalized and included in other intangible assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
the value of the capitalized servicing rights represents the present value of the future servicing fees arising from the right to service loans in the portfolio 
critical accounting policies for msrs relate to the initial valuation and subsequent impairment tests 
the methodology used to determine the valuation of msrs requires the development and use of a number of estimates  including anticipated principal amortization and prepayments of that principal balance 
events that may significantly affect the estimates used are changes in interest rates  mortgage loan prepayment speeds and the payment performance of the underlying loans 
the carrying value of the msrs is periodically reviewed for impairment based on a determination of fair value 
for purposes of measuring impairment  the servicing rights are compared to a valuation prepared based on a discounted cash flow methodology  utilizing current prepayment speeds and discount rates 
impairment  if any  is recognized through a valuation allowance and is recorded as amortization of intangible assets 
intangible assets mutualfirst periodically assesses the impairment of its goodwill and the recoverability of its core deposit intangible 
impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
if actual external conditions and future operating results differ from mutualfirst s judgments  impairment and or increased amortization charges may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of these assets to the appropriate value 
impact of inflation our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the principles require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
our primary assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates affect our performance more than general levels of inflation 
interest rates  however  do not necessarily move in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the price of goods and services  since such prices are affected by inflation 
in a 
next page period of rapidly rising interest rates  the liquidity and maturity structure of our assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptance performance levels 
the principal effect of inflation  as distinct from levels of interest rates  on earnings is in the area of non interest expense 
expense items such as employee compensation  employee benefits and occupancy and equipment cost may increase because of inflation 
inflation also may increase the dollar value of the collateral securing loans that we have made 
we are unable to determine the extent to which properties securing our loans have appreciated in dollar value due to inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset and liability management and market risk our risk when interest rates change 
the rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally is established contractually for a period of time 
market interest rates change over time 
accordingly  our results of operations  like those of other financial institutions  are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities 
the risk associated with changes in interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is our most significant market risk 
how we measure our risk of interest rate changes 
as part of our attempt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and comply with applicable regulations  we monitor our interest rate risk 
in monitoring interest rate risk  we continually analyze and manage assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates  the timing of their maturities  and their sensitivity to actual or potential changes in market interest rates 
in order to minimize the potential for adverse effects of material and prolonged changes in interest rates on our results of operations  we adopted asset and liability management policies to better match the maturities and repricing terms of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
mutual federal s board of directors sets and recommends asset and liability policies  which are implemented by the asset and liability management committee 
the asset and liability management committee is chaired by the chief financial officer and is comprised of members of our senior management 
the purpose of the asset and liability management committee is to communicate  coordinate and control asset liability management issues consistent with our business plan and board approved policies 
this committee establishes and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources taking into account relative costs and spreads  interest rate sensitivity and liquidity needs 
the objectives are to manage assets and funding sources consistent with liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk and profitability goals 
the asset and liability management committee generally meets monthly to review  among other things  economic conditions and interest rate outlook  current and projected liquidity needs and capital position  anticipated changes in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities and interest rate risk exposure limits versus current projections pursuant to a net present value of portfolio equity analysis and income simulations 
at each meeting  the asset and liability management committee recommends appropriate strategy changes based on this review 
the chief financial officer is responsible for reviewing and reporting on the effects of the policy implementations and strategies to the board of directors  at least quarterly 

next page in order to manage our assets and liabilities and achieve the desired liquidity  credit quality  interest rate risk  profitability and capital targets  we have sought to originate and purchase adjustable rate mortgage loans and commercial business loans  originate shorter term consumer loans  manage our deposits to establish stable deposit relationships  acquire longer term borrowings at fixed rates  when appropriate  to offset the negative impact of longer term fixed rate loans in our loan portfolio  and limit the percentage of long term fixed rate loans in our portfolio 
depending on the level of general interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  the asset and liability management committee may increase our interest rate risk position somewhat in order to maintain our net interest margin 
we intend to increase our emphasis on the origination of relatively short term and or adjustable rate loans 
in addition  in an effort to avoid an increase in the percentage of long term fixed rate loans in our portfolio  in  we sold million of fixed rate  one to four family mortgage loans with a term to maturity of over years in the secondary market 
the asset and liability management committee regularly reviews interest rate risk by forecasting the impact of alternative interest rate environments on net interest income and market value of portfolio equity  which is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments  and evaluating such impacts against the maximum potential changes in net interest income and market value of portfolio equity that are authorized by our board of directors 
mutual federal employs a financial model that provides the following tables 
the tables present the change in our net portfolio value at december  and that would occur upon an immediate and sustained change in market interest rates of to basis points as required by the office of thrift supervision  and do not give any effect to actions that management might take to counteract that change 
the changes in net portfolio value under all rate changes shown were within board of director approved guidelines

certain assumptions are input to the financial model in assessing the interest rate risk of savings banks 
these assumptions relate to interest rates  loan prepayment rates  deposit decay rates  and the market value of certain assets under differing interest rate scenarios  among others 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing tables 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  if interest rates change  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the tables
