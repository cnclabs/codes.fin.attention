identical store sales  which excludes sales for remodels with expansions of square footage greater than and relocations  increased approximately  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
sales from relocations and remodels with expansions of square footage greater than are excluded from identical store sales data to reduce the impact of square footage growth on the comparison

stores closed for eight or more days due to unusual events such as fires  snowstorms or hurricanes are excluded from the comparable and identical store base in the first fiscal week of closure until re opened for a full fiscal week 
we believe our comparable store sales growth and the ability to open successful stores in diverse markets are due to the broad appeal of our stores  natural and organic products entering the mainstream consciousness  improvements in overall store execution and the growing awareness of our brand

our pricing strategy continues to be market driven in grocery and whole body nutritional supplements  vitamins  and body care  in which we aim to be competitively priced on the same or similar items 
our perishables may be priced at a premium to reflect the higher quality of product available in our stores 
in all years  gross profit margins were also positively affected by margin improvements as stores mature

critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions and factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the continued appropriateness of our accounting policies and resulting estimates to make adjustments we consider appropriate under the facts and circumstances 
we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position  and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
insurance and self insurance liabilities the company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance plans to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation  general liability  property insurance  director and officers liability insurance  vehicle liability and employee health care benefits 
liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the company are estimated  in part  by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 

table of contents inventory valuation we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
cost was determined using the last in  first out lifo method for approximately and of inventories in fiscal years and  respectively 
under the lifo method  the cost assigned to items sold is based on the cost of the most recent items purchased 
as a result  the costs of the first items purchased remain in inventory and are used to value ending inventory 
the excess of estimated current costs over lifo carrying value  or lifo reserve  was approximately million and million at september  and september   respectively 
costs for remaining inventories are determined by the first in  first out fifo method 
cost was determined using the retail method for approximately and of inventories in fiscal years and  respectively 
under the retail method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a cost to retail ratio for various groupings of similar items to the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the retail inventory method calculations are certain management judgments and estimates  including shrinkage  which could impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
cost was determined using the item cost method for approximately and of inventories in fiscal years and  respectively 
this method involves counting each item in inventory  assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances of each item and recording the actual cost of items sold 
the item cost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory and purchasing levels when compared to the retail method of accounting 
goodwill and intangible assets we review goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit level annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
we allocate goodwill to one reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing 
we determine fair value utilizing both a market value method and discounted projected future cash flows compared to our carrying value for the purpose of identifying impairment 
our evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates 
application of alternative assumptions and definitions  such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different organizational level  could produce significantly different results 
income taxes we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities by applying statutory tax rates in effect at the balance sheet date to differences between the book basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted to reflect changes in tax laws or rates in the period that includes the enactment date 
significant accounting judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals  deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of business  there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
in addition  we are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the irs and other state and local taxing authorities 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates
