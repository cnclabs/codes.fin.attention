 earnings per share 
for a discussion of the company s critical accounting policies and estimates  see page overview the company develops  manufactures and markets value adding technologies based on surface and materials science for a wide spectrum of served markets 
the company also provides its technology segments  their customers and others with precious and base metals and related services 
the company s businesses are organized into four reportable segments that are discussed individually below 
additional detailed descriptive material is included in item business and note  business segment and geographic area data 
one of the strengths of the company is that its segments serve diverse markets  which is important for assessing the variability of future cash flows 
the following economic comments also provide a useful context for evaluating the company s performance worldwide auto builds continue to be relatively flat  albeit at fairly high levels industry growth for auto emission catalysts will benefit from tougher environmental regulation throughout the world over the next years as well as developing economies  especially new asian production  more stringent diesel emission regulations are being phased in  affording the company additional opportunities for catalyst solutions  worldwide petroleum refineries are operating close to capacity generating demand for the extra yields provided by engelhard s advanced fluid cracking catalysts and performance additives  markets for effect pigments  colors and active ingredients in cosmetics  personal care  auto finishes and coatings have remained positive during the recent economic downturns and tend to be less cyclical  although there are signs of recovery  there has been little change in chemical industry customers continued ability to delay large replacement catalyst orders and the related demand for platinum group metal refining services  the coated  free sheet paper market is strengthening  but pricing and related market share loss continue to negatively impact the company  and margins related to the supply of metal to industrial customers are lower because of changes in pricing and supply arrangements 
results of operations net earnings in included a restructuring charge of million related to the consolidation of certain manufacturing facilities and a net tax provision benefit of million resulting from an agreement reached with the internal revenue service with respect to the company s tax returns for through net earnings in include a royalty settlement gain of million  a charge of million for the fair value of the remaining lease costs of certain minerals storage facilities that the company ceased to use and restructuring charges of million 
in addition  a transition charge of million was recorded on january  as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
net earnings in include an impairment charge of million associated with the engelhard clal joint venture  an impairment charge of million associated with an investment in fuel cell developer plug power inc  a charge of million related to a manufacturing consolidation plan and a million insurance settlement gain 
the information in the discussion of each segment s results discussed below is derived directly from the internal financial reporting system used for management purposes 
items allocated to each segment s results include the majority of corporate operating charges 
unallocated items include interest expense  interest income  royalty income  sale of precious metals accounted for under the last in  first out lifo method  certain special charges and credits  income taxes  certain information technology development costs and other miscellaneous corporate items 
environmental technologies the majority of this segment s sales is derived from technologies to control pollution from mobile sources  including gasoline and diesel powered passenger cars  sport utility vehicles  trucks  buses and motorcycles 
this segment s customers generally are driven by increasingly stringent environmental regulations  for which the company provides sophisticated emission control technologies 
the remainder of this segment s sales is derived from products sold into a variety of industrial markets  including aerospace  power generation  process industries and utility engines 
the company supplies these industrial markets with sophisticated emission control technologies  high value material products made primarily from platinum group metals and thermal spray and coating technologies 
performance results of operations in millions change to change to sales operating earnings before special items special charge credit operating earnings discussion results from this segment were strong  as operating earnings improved from mobile source markets and from industrial products markets 
sales to mobile source markets increased in compared with approximately half this increase related to higher substrate costs 
these substrates are manufactured by third party suppliers who often set prices directly with the company s customers 
these costs do not impact the company s profits  but  as substrate costs rise  the company s operating margins decrease due to dollar for dollar increases in selling prices 
substrate costs rose in due to an increase in demand for emission control systems for diesel engines 
translation of sales of the company s foreign operations accounted for of the sales increase to mobile source markets in compared with the company serves a wide customer base  and changes in the mix of sales to these markets are common 
notably in compared with  increased sales to diesel engine oems were largely offset by decreased sales to the diesel retrofit market  which  in  included low margin sales from a canning facility the company closed in operating earnings from mobile source markets increased in compared with the largest reason for this increase was absence of a million restructuring charge recorded in favorable impacts from foreign currency translation of million and reversal of warranty reserves of million were mostly offset by higher information technology expenses of million and higher diesel r d expense of million 
the company serves a wide base of customers within these markets 
as changes in the mix of customers and vehicles occur  operating earnings may be affected 
for example  catalytic technologies vary depending on vehicle  engine type and engine size 
profitability is impacted by the mix of vehicle platforms and by the sales of particular vehicles for which the company provides catalyst 
in  profits from mobile source diesel markets increased while profits from other mobile source markets decreased compared with the diesel oem market remains one of this segment s primary growth areas  and represents the first year sales to this market significantly contributed to earnings 
these improvements were partially offset by a decline in earnings from diesel retrofit markets 
in  the company experienced strong profitability from a diesel retrofit project in hong kong  which was completed early in operating earnings from traditional light duty vehicle markets declined in although light duty automobile builds in north america and europe were flat in compared with  operating earnings declined due to the mix of vehicle platforms for which the company provided catalyst 
it is important to note the company currently serves the large asian markets of japan and korea through joint ventures accounted for under the equity method 
accordingly  results of those operations are not included in the operating earnings of this segment 
automobile builds in asia were higher in than  and the company s asian joint ventures experienced increased profits see section titled equity earnings 
sales to industrial product markets decreased as a decline in sales to power generation customers more than offset improved sales to the aerospace  temperature sensing and refining markets 
the decline in demand from the power generation market was expected  and costs were reduced accordingly 
earnings from industrial product markets improved significantly in compared with primarily due to productivity initiatives 
earnings from the aerospace market improved versus the prior year  but have not returned to levels experienced prior to the temperature sensing market  while relatively small  represents a niche growth area in which the company increased investment in through acquisition and research and development 
profits were flat in versus as the company expanded into this market globally 
while cash flows from other served markets remain sufficient to support existing assets  certain operations are being evaluated from a strategic standpoint 
it is possible that some of these assets may be sold or shut down 
long lived assets associated with these operations  which are currently recoverable  are approximately million  and the majority of the employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that contains severance provisions 
outlook near term demand for the company s products sold to mobile source markets is expected to remain at or near current levels 
worldwide automobile builds for are forecast to be flat to modestly higher than in as more stringent emission regulations phase in for model year gasoline automobiles  it will have a positive effect on the us market 
demand for diesel emission technologies is expected to increase as more of these vehicles are sold and regulations become more stringent 
heavy duty diesel emission standards worldwide are forecast to tighten  with step changes occurring in and demand for the company s technology to these markets is subject to changes in mix  the level of worldwide auto builds and competitive pressures resulting from current excess capacity in the industry 
the company maintains a strong technology position in these markets and continues to invest significantly in research and development 
in stationary source markets  demand is expected to remain soft for technologies related to peak power generation due to the current lack of funding for these projects 
the overall power generation industry has experienced difficulty in recent years due to deregulation and financial instability associated with high levels of capital spending 
the company has right sized this business and has maintained the technical ability and capacity to serve this market when demand returns 
the company s thermal spray operation  which serves the power generation and aerospace markets  has seen a modest improvement in demand 
the company expects this trend to continue  but does not expect these markets to return to pre levels 
in response  this operation has been expanding applications of its technology to previously unserved components within the aerospace market  and it is experiencing some initial commercial success 
other industrial markets served include temperature sensing and industrial products 
a recent foreign acquisition positions the company globally to participate in the projected worldwide growth of the temperature sensing market 
certain industrial products operations are not considered core to the company  and it is possible that some of these may be sold or shut down 
this segment continues to work to reduce its reliance on traditional mobile source markets by developing technologies for an array of applications  including motorcycles  small engines  such as lawn and garden power equipment  charbroilers  mining and construction  heavy duty diesel engines  and ozone management 
compared with sales increased primarily from the addition of higher pass through substrate costs and the favorable impact of foreign exchange  which collectively accounted for approximately two thirds of the sales increase 
sales were also favorably impacted from increased volumes to the mobile source markets 
these sales increases were partially offset by million decreased sales to the power generation market and by million decreased sales of thermal spray applications to the aerospace and power generation markets 
operating earnings were higher from increased volumes to the mobile source markets 
operating earnings were also favorably impacted by absence of costs in the year ago period related to rework for power generation applications of million  the favorable impact of foreign exchange of million  and a manufacturing consolidation charge of million recorded in the increase was partially offset by lower volumes of emission control systems to the power generation markets and lower volumes of thermal spray applications 
earnings were also decreased by a management consolidation and productivity initiative that resulted in a charge of million recorded in  the reversal of a warranty accrual of million in  the recognition of expenses of million due to customer related financial issues  higher depreciation costs of million and higher energy costs of million 
process technologies the process technologies segment enables customers to make their processes more productive  efficient  environmentally sound and safer through the supply of advanced chemical process catalysts  additives and sorbents 
performance results of operations in millions change to change to sales operating earnings before special items special charge operating earnings discussion this segment experienced a difficult year  as improved earnings from the petroleum refining markets were more than offset by decreased earnings from chemical process markets 
sales of catalyst and additives to the petroleum refining market increased in compared with the increase was driven by strong demand for products derived from the company s distributed matrix structure dms technology platform  which sold at premium prices 
dms technology allows refiners to increase yields 
higher volumes of petroleum refining additives also positively impacted sales 
these improvements were modestly offset by decreased demand for older product offerings displaced by dms technology 
operating earnings from products sold to petroleum refining markets increased in compared with profits from increased demand for dms technologies and other additives were partially offset by higher information technology costs of approximately million  higher raw material costs of approximately million and the impact of a particularly severe hurricane season 
during  strong demand for dms technology began to exceed existing capacity at the operating facility that produces these products 
as a result  other assets were utilized to meet the additional demand  resulting in higher transportation  production scheduling and asset utilization costs 
in  the company launched a series of projects designed to increase both capacity and the productivity of assets that serve this market 
operating earnings for also were negatively impacted by million compared with due to the timing of customer orders for certain older technologies 
sales of catalysts to the chemical process markets increased modestly in compared with the increase resulted from a currency exchange impact of approximately million and a change in product mix  which was partially offset by million of price reductions in older custom catalyst technologies 
sales to chemical process customers continued to be depressed  as customer capacity remained at levels that did not require catalyst change outs 
volumes of lynx polypropylene catalysts increased in compared with as market acceptance continued and expanded capacity at the company s facility in tarragona  spain came on line 
operating earnings from products sold to chemical process markets decreased significantly  driven primarily by the above mentioned price reduction of million  higher raw material costs of approximately million  a change in product mix and higher information technology costs of approximately million 
these factors were partially offset by a favorable impact from currency exchange of approximately million and absence of restructuring expenses included in the special charge referenced in the table above 
outlook the outlook for operations serving the petroleum refining markets is strong for and beyond 
demand for premium priced catalysts and additives is expected to remain high due to external factors  including high crude oil prices  absence of additional worldwide refining capacity  increased demand for gasoline and environmental fuel compliance 
the company also expects to realize price increases on certain products in early the company s cost position is expected to improve in compared with as debottlenecking and other productivity initiatives launched in begin to produce favorable results 
the company continues to invest in research and development to maintain the competitive advantage derived from its unique dms technology platform 
the outlook for operations serving chemical process markets is mixed for sales to polypropylene customers are expected to improve as market acceptance of lynx products continues 
the company is expanding into the polyethylene catalyst market 
although the company expects to sell these catalysts at a faster growth rate than the market itself  it does not anticipate these sales to contribute significantly to earnings 
the outlook for operations serving other chemical process markets is not expected to change in as catalyst customers continue to delay large  replacement orders 
although industry consolidation has created global customers who are attempting to leverage their buying power  the company does expect to implement price increases 
the company continues to invest in development of proprietary technologies that can command premium prices 
these technologies include catalysts for gas to liquid  custom zeolite and dehydrogenation applications 
compared with sales grew primarily from increased demand for new technologies offered to the petroleum refining dms technology platform products and chemical process markets lynx platform and gas to liquids  which aggregated million  and the favorable impact of foreign exchange of million 
sales were reduced by million due to lower precious metal prices  which are passed through to chemical process catalyst customers in europe and lower sales to certain chemical process markets 
operating earnings rose primarily due to increased demand for new technologies offered to the petroleum refining and chemical process markets  lower raw material costs of million excluding nickel  the favorable impact of foreign exchange of million  and benefits from productivity programs 
these increases were partially offset by a productivity initiative that resulted in a charge of million recorded in the first quarter of  higher energy costs of million and higher nickel costs of million 
appearance and performance technologies the appearance and performance technologies segment provides pigments  effect materials  personal care active ingredients and performance additives that enable its customers to market enhanced image and functionality in their products 
this segment serves a broad array of end markets  including cosmetics  personal care  coatings  plastics  automotive  construction and paper 
the segment s products help customers improve the look  functionality  performance and overall cost of their products 
in addition  the segment is the internal supply source of precursors for most of the company s advanced petroleum refining catalysts 
performance results of operations in millions change to change to sales operating earnings before special items special charge operating earnings discussion results from this segment were mixed  as decreased earnings from sales to the paper market were partially offset by improved earnings from other markets 
sales of kaolin and attapulgite based products decreased in compared with as decreased volumes to the paper market were mostly offset by significant sales growth of non paper kaolin applications 
worldwide demand for coated paper increased in  but not to levels sufficient to impact current overcapacity in the kaolin industry 
that overcapacity is a result of brazilian kaolin producers having brought more than million tons of annual capacity on line since and not in kind competition from calcium carbonate 
in late  the company attempted to maintain pricing and implement an energy surcharge 
certain paper customers responded by contracting with other kaolin providers  and the company s market share decreased in during  the company rationalized certain products for the paper market and aggressively pursued other specialty  kaolin based applications 
sales of kaolin based products to markets other than paper increased significantly in compared with these markets include plastics  construction  automotive  agriculture and coatings 
operating earnings from kaolin and attapulgite based products decreased in compared with included in the results is a restructuring charge of million related to consolidation of certain manufacturing facilities that included asset impairment charges of million and severance charges of million 
results for include a charge of million for the fair value of remaining lease costs of certain minerals storage facilities the company ceased to use 
these businesses incurred higher information technology costs of approximately million in compared with decreased earnings from mineral based products to the paper market were partially offset by earnings from mineral based products to other markets as discussed above 
natural gas costs remained at historically high levels in  and the company had little success implementing gas surcharges to paper customers 
cash flows from kaolin based operations remain substantial  and the assets have been reviewed with respect to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
currently  these assets are not impaired 
sales of effect materials  colors and personal care actives increased in compared with in july of  the company strengthened its position in the personal care market by acquiring the collaborative group  ltd  including its wholly owned subsidiary collaborative laboratories  inc this accounted for approximately of the increase in sales of effect materials  colors and personal care actives 
sales of effect materials and colors were strong to other served markets including cosmetics  automotive  coatings  plastics and construction 
operating earnings from effect materials  colors and personal care actives increased approximately in compared with  due primarily to the above mentioned acquisition  which was accretive to earnings 
the impact of higher volumes mentioned above was offset by increased information technology costs of approximately million and higher costs associated with product development and commercialization 
outlook earnings from the sale of kaolin and attapulgite based products are expected to improve in in spite of the expectation of continued weak sales to the paper market 
this growth is expected to come from productivity improvements  price increases and sales increases to non paper markets 
late in  the company implemented a plan to consolidate certain manufacturing facilities in georgia 
this plan is expected to reduce costs and improve productivity 
the company has hedged more than half its expected natural gas consumption at rates approximately one dollar higher per mmbtu than experienced in the company expects these operations to remain profitable  but changes in volumes  pricing or energy costs could cause this situation to change 
earnings from effect materials  colors and personal care actives are expected to grow at modest levels for the foreseeable future 
recent investment in assets serving the personal care market are expected to improve earnings  as the company continues to further develop its position in this market 
the company recently announced an offer that translates into a purchase price of million to acquire of coletica  sa  a french publicly traded company serving the personal care markets 
this segment is investing in information technology to support its overall efforts to improve productivity  reduce operating costs and improve customer service 
competition  notably from asian producers  continues to pressure certain markets served by these operations 
the company expects to mitigate this impact by leveraging its technology to expand its portfolio of applications and served markets 
compared with sales increased slightly in as sales increases to the coatings  cosmetics and automotive markets  and the net favorable impact of foreign exchange of million were partially offset by lower volumes of kaolin based products to the paper and industrial end markets 
lower volumes of kaolin based products were attributed to continued weak demand in the paper market and the loss of some volume to competition due to pricing 
operating earnings were lower primarily from a charge of million recorded in for the fair value of the remaining lease costs of certain minerals storage facilities that the company ceased to use  lower volumes to the paper market  higher energy costs of million and higher costs related to the start up of a new manufacturing plant in china 
this decrease was partially offset by continued strong growth in the colorant and effect pigment markets 
materials services the materials services segment serves the company s technology segments  their customers and others with precious and base metals and related services 
this is a distribution and materials services business that purchases and sells precious metals  base metals  other commodities and related products and services 
it does so under a variety of pricing and delivery arrangements structured to meet the logistical  financial and price risk management requirements of the company  its customers and suppliers 
additionally  it offers the related services of precious metal refining and storage  and produces precious metal salts and solutions 
performance results of operations in millions change to change to sales operating earnings before special items special credit operating earnings discussion sales for this segment include substantially all the company s sales of metals to industrial customers of all segments 
sales also include fees invoiced for services rendered eg  refining and handling charges 
because of the logistical and hedging nature of much of this business and the significant precious metal values included in both sales and cost of sales  gross margins tend to be low in relation to the company s technology segments  as does capital employed 
this effect also dampens the gross margin percentages of the company as a whole  but improves the return on investment 
while many customers for the company s platinum group metal catalysts purchase the metal from materials services  some choose to deliver metal from other sources prior to manufacture 
in such cases  precious metal values are not included in sales 
the mix of such arrangements and extent of market price fluctuations can significantly affect the reported level of sales and cost of sales 
consequently  there is no necessary direct correlation between year to year changes in reported sales and operating earnings 
sales in increased due to higher platinum group metal pgm prices 
operating earnings in include million of legal provisions related to pending litigation 
operating earnings in benefited from a contract settlement of million and reversal of a million accrual that is no longer necessary 
earnings from metal sourcing operations improved in compared with refining and related service operations also improved in compared with as the company s us refinery resolved certain performance difficulties 
these refining operations  which are strategically important to the operations of the company s environmental technologies and process technologies segments  returned to profitability 
outlook the results of this segment are likely to approximate operating earnings levels between million and million rather than the modestly higher levels of continued overall weakness projected in the chemical markets should continue to adversely impact the recycling and refining of platinum group metals 
in addition  the results of this segment continue to reflect ongoing changes in these markets  which involve different pricing formulas that have reduced historical margins on the sourcing and distribution of platinum group metals 
compared with operating earnings were lower primarily from the timing of certain items discussed below  changes in pricing formulas that reduce margins and lower results from the recycling refining of platinum group metals of million 
recycling earnings were down primarily from higher costs associated with performance issues at a domestic refinery and a less favorable mix of metals 
operating earnings in benefited from a contract settlement of million and the reversal of an accrual that is no longer necessary of million 
in  operating earnings were favorably affected by million of income related to platinum group metal transactions realized previously but deferred pending the resolution of certain contractual provisions  an insurance settlement gain of million included as a special credit  million of income related to a previously unrecognized contractual benefit and million of income related to cash received from the settlement of litigation 
sales decreased from lower platinum group metal prices and lower volumes

margins in the environmental technologies and appearance and performance technologies segments were flat see management s discussion and analysis section on environmental technologies  process technologies  and appearance and performance technologies for further discussion 
the overall decrease in compared to was primarily due to lower margins earned in the materials services segment and in the environmental technologies segment see management s discussion and analysis section on environmental technologies and materials services for further discussion 
as described earlier  the lower margins on materials services sales are driven by the inclusion of the value of precious metals in both sales and cost of sales 
gross profit as a percentage of sales is expected to be comparable in lower margins in the environmental technologies segment are primarily due to higher pass through substrate costs and will be offset by higher margins in the process technologies and appearance and performance technologies segments primarily due to the completion of productivity initiatives taken in and price increases 
selling  administrative and other expenses selling  administrative and other expenses were million in compared with million in and million in the increase in was primarily due to increased benefit and pension expenses of million  increased research and development expenses of million  incremental sarbanes oxley compliance related expenses of approximately million  million in incremental operating expenses from the collaborative acquisition  increased freight  shipping  and railcar related expenses of million  increased legal fees of million and the impact of foreign currency translation on selling  administrative and other expenses of approximately million partially offset by higher royalty income of million and lower bad debt expense of million 
the increase in was primarily due to increased professional and legal fees of million  increased research and development expenses of million and increased information technology expenses of million 
the company expects selling  administrative and other expenses to increase in comparable with prior year increases 
key drivers will be new sfas no 
r requirements regarding stock option expense  information technology expenses  employee medical and pension expenses  lower royalty income  full year operating expenses from the collaborative acquisition and other expenses 
equity earnings equity in earnings of affiliates was million in compared to million in  and million in the company currently owns hdz  a owned former subsidiary of engelhard clal 
the company recognized earnings from this joint venture and related holdings of million in and million in these earnings resulted primarily from the sale of platinum inventories at favorable prices  realized gains on the sale of an inactive facility  and the strengthening of the euro versus the us dollar 
as the company has substantially liquidated this joint venture and related holdings  earnings will greatly decrease in the company recognized earnings from its asian joint ventures ne chemcat and heesung engelhard of million in  million in and million in the company participates in these joint ventures primarily to serve the japanese and korean mobile source environmental markets 
the strong improvements from through are primarily due to improved sales to these mobile source markets 
the company maintains active alliances with these joint ventures to improve its overall position in these markets 
in march  the company acquired an additional ownership of ne chemcat in exchange for a interest in the company s chinese operation serving the mobile source environmental markets 
the company expects equity earnings from these joint ventures to remain at or above their current high levels  due to anticipated growth in the asian mobile source markets 
loss on investment in and  the company recorded a loss on its plug power investment of million and million  respectively see note  investments  for further detail 
interest interest expense was million in  compared with million in and million in interest expense in decreased due to the company s use of interest rate swap agreements that effectively change fixed rate debt obligations to floating rate debt obligations  partially offset by higher foreign short term interest rates 
interest expense in decreased as a result of decreased borrowings and lower short term interest rates 
interest income was million in  million in and million in the company capitalized interest of million in and million in and in  the company opportunistically issued yen denominated debt with a coupon rate of 
this issuance lowered the average borrowing rate 
the percentage of variable rate debt to total debt was at december  compared to at december  the company expects interest expense to increase in  due to higher interest rates 
as discussed above  of the company s borrowings is exposed to changes in short term interest rates  and a significant increase in short term rates would negatively impact the company s interest expense 
the company could also experience increased borrowing levels due to acquisitions or other investment activity 
taxes the worldwide income tax expense was million in  compared with million in and million in the effective tax rate was in  in and in excluding the equity investment impairment charge of million 
the decrease in the overall effective tax rate in compared to was primarily due to the conclusion of an irs audit of the company s tax returns in the second quarter  which resulted in an million tax benefit 
the company believes that its effective tax rate on recurring business operations will be in the range through with a potential increase of one percentage point in years after due to the impact of the enactment of the american jobs creation act of in connection with the recent tax law changes  the company is assessing the new tax rules relating to the repatriation of offshore earnings from its foreign subsidiaries and it will take appropriate measures in in this regard  it is too early to reasonably predict what steps the company will take and the corresponding impact to the company s financial statements in liquidity and capital resources liquidity working capital was million at december   compared with million at december  the current ratio was and at december  and  respectively 
the working capital of the company s technology segments environmental technologies  process technologies and appearance and performance technologies is not subject to significant fluctuations from period to period 
while these businesses experience some modest seasonality  it is not enough to have a significant impact on their overall working capital requirements 
the working capital of the materials services segment may vary due to the timing of metal contracts  but is monitored closely by senior management 
while long term working capital requirements cannot be readily predicted  it is expected that they will grow proportionally with the revenues and earnings of the technology segments 
cash balances were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the majority of this cash is held by foreign subsidiaries 
where economically feasible  the company finances its foreign subsidiaries locally 
the company maintains cash pooling systems among certain foreign operations  most notably in europe  that allow for effective inter subsidiary financing 
it is not economically practical to pay down the company s debt due to its long term nature  therefore the company currently maintains a relatively high cash balance 
as of december   the company had two committed revolving credit facilities  a short term million  day facility  expiring may   and a long term million  five year committed credit facility expiring in may on march   the company replaced the above mentioned committed credit facilities with a new million  five year committed credit facility 
this facility is to be used for general corporate purposes  including  without limitation  to provide liquidity support for the issuance of commercial paper and acquisition financing 
the company s total debt increased to million at december  from million at december  the percentage of total debt to total capitalization increased to at december  from at december  the increase in debt levels is primarily due to the issuance of japanese yen billion notes bearing a coupon of in the private placement market 
in addition to the low coupon rate  these notes serve as an effective net investment hedge of a portion of the company s yen denominated investments 
through a public debt offering in may  the company issued million of year notes 
these notes mature on may  and bear an interest rate of 
as discussed in note  derivative instruments and hedging  these notes were effectively changed from a fixed rate debt obligation to a floating rate debt obligation through the use of interest rate swap agreements 
in  the company increased its existing million shelf registration to million in order to increase the company s ability to raise cash for general corporate purposes 
the company maintains investment grade credit ratings that it considers important for cost effective and ready access to the capital markets 
should the company s rating drop below investment grade  the company would experience higher capital costs and may incur difficulty in procuring metals 
the company s available cash and unused committed credit lines represent a measure of the company s short term liquidity position 
the company believes that its short term liquidity position is sufficient to meet the cash requirements of the company 
in addition to the short term liquidity  the company s investment grade rating  million shelf registration and access to debt and equity markets are sufficient to meet the long term liquidity requirements of the company 
capital resources the company s technology segments represent the most significant internal capital resource of the company 
the company s technology segments contain businesses that currently generate cash approximating earnings 
this is evidenced by the comparison of depreciation and amortization to capital spending for these segments 
cash flows from the materials services segment tend to fluctuate from period to period due to the timing of metal contracts 
in  this segment was a user of cash  while in  this segment was a provider of cash 
the all other category includes certain small manufacturing operations  the strategic technologies group and other corporate functions  which collectively use cash 
the strategic technologies group develops technologies to commercial levels to generate future sources of cash 
the variance in cash flows from operating activities primarily occurred in the materials services segment and reflects changes in metal positions used to facilitate requirements of the company  its metal customers and suppliers see note  supplemental information  for materials services variances 
current levels of hedged metal obligations and committed metal positions are expected to prevail for at least the next year 
materials services routinely enters into a variety of arrangements for the sourcing of metals 
generally  transactions are hedged on a daily basis see note  summary of significant accounting policies  for further detail 
hedging is accomplished primarily through forward  future and option contracts 
however  in closely monitored situations for which exposure levels have been set by senior management  the company  from time to time  holds large unhedged industrial commodity positions that are subject to future market price fluctuations 
these positions are included in committed metal positions  along with hedged metal holdings 
the bulk of hedged metal obligations represent spot short positions 
other than in closely monitored situations  these positions are hedged through forward purchases 
unless a forward counterparty fails to perform  there is no price risk 
in addition  the aggregate fair value of derivatives in a loss position is reported in hedged metal obligations derivatives in a gain position are included in committed metal positions 
materials services works to ensure that the company and its customers have an uninterrupted source of metals  primarily platinum group metals  utilizing supply contracts and commodities markets around the world 
committed metal positions may include significant advances made for the purchase of precious metals that have been delivered to the company but for which the final purchase price has not yet been determined 
as of december   the aggregate market value of the metals purchased under a contract for which a provisional price had been paid was in excess of the amounts advanced by a total of million 
as a result  this amount was recorded in committed metal positions and accounts payable at december  the company s joint ventures operate independently of additional company financing 
these joint ventures returned million of cash to the company in this included a net million of liquidating proceeds from the former engelhard clal joint venture 
proceeds from this joint venture are not expected to be significant in proceeds from the asian joint ventures are expected to decrease to approximately million in the company also depends upon access to debt and equity markets  as discussed in the liquidity section  as a source of cash 
the company continues to invest currently to develop future sources of cash through self investment  alliances  licensing agreements and acquisition 
notably  in  the company invested million in research and development  million in capital projects and million in acquisitions 
key capital projects for include the expansion of an automotive catalyst facility in china  an expansion of polyolefin catalyst capacity in spain  a process improvement project for the petroleum refining catalyst business and a global information technology project 
capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately million to million 
acquisitions in included million for an operation that expanded the capacity and global customer base of the company s temperature sensing business and million for the acquisition of the collaborative group  ltd  including its wholly owned subsidiary collaborative laboratories  inc  which strengthens the company s position in the personal care market 
the company actively pursues investment opportunities that meet risk and return criteria set by senior management 
the company expects to find opportunities in the future and will act upon these opportunities accordingly 
the company has no significant investment commitments as of december   however  the company recently announced an offer that translates into a purchase price of million to acquire of coletica  sa  a french publicly traded company serving the personal care markets 
if sources of cash exceed opportunities for investment  the company will return value to the shareholders 
this is done through share buy back programs  dividends and debt repayment 
in the company purchased approximately million outstanding shares of common stock net of stock options exercised 
additionally  in early  the company s board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend from per share to per share 
the company expects to find future investment opportunities  and will be able to reduce the future amount of shares purchased when this occurs 
the following table is a representation of the company s contractual obligations as of december  the notes below provide further detail with regard to the company s contractual obligations payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in millions short term borrowings accounts payable other current liabilities hedged metal obligations long term debt  including interest payments a operating leases b purchase obligations metal supply contracts c other purchase obligations d other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet under gaap e total contractual obligations a future interest payments calculated using the december  libor rate and foreign exchange rates as of december  b in january  the company renewed its existing five year operating lease for machinery and equipment used in the process technologies segment that was to mature in the term of this lease is seven years 
lease payments of approximately million per year are not included in these amounts 
c these amounts reflect minimum purchase obligations for the purchase of platinum group metals assuming the december  prices for the various metals continue into the specified future periods 
however  these are not fixed price arrangements  the prices are based on future market prices 
as a result  the company will be able to hedge the purchases with sales at those future prices 
d amounts primarily relate to purchase orders for raw material purchases and warehousing and transportation related costs 
e amounts primarily relate to postretirement postemployment obligations see note  benefits  for further detail  with the remainder consisting of executive deferred compensation  sfas no 
asset retirement obligations see note  accounting for asset retirement obligations  for further detail and the long term portion of the environmental reserve see note  environmental costs  for further detail 
the more than years category includes million related to the company s minimum pension liability see note  benefits  as well as million of other noncurrent liabilities for which the timing of payment is not readily determinable 
in the normal course of business  the company incurs obligations with regard to contract completion  regulatory compliance and product performance 
under certain circumstances  these obligations are supported through the issuance of letters of credit 
at december   the aggregate outstanding amount of letters of credit supporting such obligations amounted to million  of which million will expire in less than one year  million will expire in two to three years and million will expire after five years 
in the opinion of management  such obligations will not significantly affect the company s financial position or results of operations as the company anticipates fulfilling its performance obligations 
the company has not engaged in any transaction within the past months  and has no agreement or other contractual arrangement  to which an entity unconsolidated with the company is a party that would constitute an off balance sheet arrangement  as such term is defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
credit risk the company believes that its financial instruments do not represent a concentration of credit risk because the company deals with a variety of major banks worldwide and its accounts receivable are spread among a number of major industries  customers and geographic areas 
a centralized credit committee reviews significant credit transactions and risk management issues before granting credit  and an appropriate level of reserves is maintained 
in addition  the company  through its credit committee and credit department  monitors the status of worldwide accounts receivable and the financial condition of its customers to help ensure collections and to minimize losses 
the company may enter into transactions in which it advances funds after receipt of metal as provisional payment for the metal which is to be finally priced under market based pricing formulae that will result in a determination of that price 
if the final price is less than the provisional price paid  the supplier will be obligated to return the difference to the company 
therefore  if the market price and the anticipated final price falls below the provisional price  the company is exposed to the potential credit risk associated with the possibility of non payment by the supplier  although no payment is due until after the final price is determined 
as of december   the aggregate market value of metals purchased under a contract for which a provisional price had been paid was in excess of the amounts advanced by a total of million 
as a result  this amount was recorded in committed metal positions and accounts payable at december   and no current credit risk exists

critical accounting policies and estimates certain key policies are explained below to assist in understanding the company s consolidated financial statements 
more detailed explanations may be found elsewhere in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a section and in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
sales a significant portion of consolidated net sales represent the sale of platinum group metals to industrial customers who buy the metals from materials services in connection with products manufactured by the environmental and process technologies segments 
accordingly  almost all of these sales are reported in the materials services segment  with a limited amount included in environmental and process technologies reported sales 
because metal price levels may vary widely  there is no consistent relationship between consolidated sales and gross profit 
because the timing of the purchase of spot metals often does not coincide with the timing of the subsequent sales to industrial users  materials services needs to hedge price risk  usually by selling forward ie  for future delivery to investment grade trading entities  industrial companies or on futures exchanges 
if a surplus of physical metal develops  materials services may also sell spot and buy forward to balance the risk position 
other than hedges entered into with industrial customers  sales related to these hedging transactions are not included in reported sales  as they are not meaningful in an industrial context 
customers of the environmental and process technologies segments who purchase products that improve efficiency and yields are often unable to precisely predict the dates that catalysts will be required 
accordingly  they may request that product that has already been ordered  manufactured and prepared for shipment at the agreed upon date be temporarily held by the company until that customer s manufacturing facility is prepared to accept the new charge of catalyst 
in cases where the customer requests the company to hold the goods  agrees to be invoiced and to pay the invoices on normal terms  as well as to accept title to the goods  the company will recognize the sale prior to shipment 
great care is exercised to make sure that these sales are only recognized in accordance with the applicable revenue recognition guidance 
mark to market materials services procures physical metal from third parties for resale and enters into forward contracts and other relatively straight forward hedging derivatives that are recorded as either assets or liabilities at their fair value 
by acting in its capacity as a distributor and materials service provider to the company s technology businesses and their customers and by taking closely monitored unhedged positions as described below  materials services takes on the attributes of a dealer in metals 
both spot metal and derivative instruments used in hedging ie  forwards  futures  swaps and options are stated at fair value 
the company values platinum  palladium  gold and silver based on the daily closing new york mercantile exchange nymex settlement prices 
there are no so called terminal markets for rhodium  so the company s own published industrial bullion eib prices are used 
however  these are compared to other reference prices published in metals week  an independent trade journal 
values for base metals come from the closing prices of the london metals exchange lme 
in closely monitored situations  for which exposure levels and transaction size limits have been set by senior management  the company holds unhedged metal positions that are subject to future market fluctuations 
such positions may include varying levels of derivative instruments 
at times  these positions can be significant 
all unhedged metal transactions are monitored and marked to market daily 
this metal that has not been hedged is therefore subject to price risk and is disclosed in note  committed metal positions and hedged metal obligations 
the fair values of materials services various spot and derivative positions are included in committed metal positions on the asset side of the consolidated balance sheet and hedged metal obligations on the liability side 
the credit performance risk associated with the fair value of derivatives in a gain position is greatly mitigated through the selection of investment grade counterparties 
precious metals most of the platinum group metals used by environmental and process technologies to manufacture products are provided in advance by the customers 
the customers often purchase these metals from materials services  but they may also be shipped in from other sources 
certain quantities of precious metals are carried at historical cost using the lifo method 
because most of the metal was acquired some time ago  the market value of this metal  while fluctuating from year to year  has generally been substantially above cost 
while this excess of market over cost is useful in evaluating the consolidated balance sheet from a credit perspective  the annual changes are not reflected in the income statement except to the extent that periodic liquidations of lifo layers produce book profits 
lifo liquidation profits are separately disclosed and not included in the operating earnings of the technology or materials services segments 
provision for environmental remediation as addressed in note  environmental costs  the company is currently preparing  has under review  or is implementing environmental investigations and cleanup plans at several currently or formerly owned and or operated sites 
in addition  sites have been identified at which the company believes liability as a potentially responsible party is probable for the cleanup of contamination and natural resource damages resulting from historic disposal of hazardous substances allegedly generated by the company  among others 
the company conducts studies  as well as site surveys  to determine the extent of environmental damage and to determine the necessary requirements to remediate this damage 
these studies incorporate the analysis of our internal environmental staff and consultation with legal counsel 
from these studies and surveys  a range of estimates of the costs involved is derived and a liability and related expenses for environmental remediation is recorded within this range 
the company s recorded liabilities for these issues represent its best estimates of remediation and restoration costs that may be required to comply with present laws and regulations 
these estimates are based on forecasts of future direct costs related to environmental remediation 
these estimates change periodically as additional or better information becomes available as to the extent of site remediation required  if any 
certain changes could occur that would materially affect the company s estimates and environmental remediation costs at known sites 
if the company discovers additional contamination  discovers previously unknown sites  or becomes subject to related personal or property damage  the company could incur material additional costs in connection with its environmental remediation 
the accrual for environmental cleanup related costs reported in the consolidated balance sheet at december  was million  including million for superfund sites 
these amounts represent those undiscounted costs that the company believes are probable and reasonably estimable 
for the year ended december   cash payments for environmental cleanup related matters were million 
based on currently available information and analysis  the company s accrual represents approximately of what it believes are the reasonably possible environmental cleanup related costs of a noncapital nature 
the estimate of reasonably possible costs is less certain than the probable estimate upon which the accrual is based 
if the highest estimate from the range based upon information presently available were recorded  the total estimated liability would have increased by million at december  based on existing information and currently enacted environmental laws and regulations  cash payments for environmental cleanup related matters are projected to be million for  which has already been accrued 
further  the company anticipates that the amounts of capitalized environmental projects and the expense of environmental compliance will approximate current levels 
goodwill as of december   the company had million of goodwill that  based on impairment testing in  is not impaired 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company completes an impairment test of goodwill annually  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of its reporting units below their carrying value 
the impairment test requires the company to estimate the fair values of its reporting units  which is done by using a discounted cash flow model 
significant estimates used in the company s discounted cash flow model include future cash flows and long term rates of growth of its reporting units and a discount rate based on the company s weighted average cost of capital 
assumptions used in determining future cash flows include current and expected market conditions and future sales forecasts 
approximately of the company s goodwill is attributable to reporting units with fair values that exceed the carrying values of the reporting units by a substantial margin 
the use of different estimates and assumptions  within the range of predictable possibilities  employed in the discounted cash flow model that measures the fair value of these reporting units  would not be expected to result in an impairment of goodwill 
the remaining of the goodwill resides in reporting units with fair values that modestly exceed the carrying values of the reporting units 
the use of different estimates and assumptions employed in the discounted cash flow model that measures the fair value of these reporting units could result in an impairment of goodwill 
however  the maximum value exposed to changes in estimates and assumptions  based upon the current range of predictable possibilities  is million 
included in this amount is million of goodwill acquired with the industrial products business within the environmental technologies segment and million of goodwill related to two acquisitions that provide minerals based products within the appearance and performance technologies segment 
certain long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company reviews its property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
impairment reviews require a comparison of the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the asset 
if the total of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the asset 
significant assumptions used in the company s undiscounted cash flow model include future cash flows attributed to the group of assets  the group of assets subject to the impairment and the time period for which the assets will be held and used 
assumptions used in determining future cash flows include current and expected market conditions and future sales forecasts 
the use of different estimates or assumptions within the company s undiscounted cash flow model could result in undiscounted cash flows lower than the current value of the company s assets  thereby requiring the need to compare the carrying values to their fair values 
the use of different estimates or assumptions when determining the fair value of the company s property  plant and equipment may result in different values for our property  plant and equipment  and any related impairment charges also  see environmental technologies md a outlook section on page and appearance and performance technologies md a outlook section on page 
in order to provide kaolin based products to the company s customers and the process technologies segment  the company engages in kaolin mining operations that are integrated into the manufacturing processes 
the company owns and leases land containing kaolin deposits on a long term basis 
the company does not own any mining reserves or conduct any mining operations with respect to platinum  palladium or other metals 
the kaolin mining process includes exploration  topsoil and overburden removal  extraction of kaolin and the subsequent reclamation of mined areas 
certain mining process costs are capitalized and expensed by the company over the life of the related estimated mineable reserves 
the quality and quantity of these mineable reserves are estimated by use of mapping  drilling  sampling and assaying that are standard evaluation methods generally accepted by the minerals industry 
other estimates considered in the evaluation of the estimated mineable reserves include long term demand forecasts and the impact of future regulatory changes 
a reduction in the estimated quantity of kaolin deposits of would result in an increase of annual amortization expense of less than million 
provision for income taxes as of december   net deferred tax assets are approximately million 
the company determines its current and deferred taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the tax effect of the reversal of tax differences is recorded at rates currently enacted for each jurisdiction in which it operates 
to the extent that temporary differences will result in future tax benefit  the company must estimate the timing of their reversal  and whether taxable operating income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any deferred tax assets of the company 
the future impact on earnings from using different assumptions and or estimates cannot be reasonably quantified due to the number of scenarios and variables that are present 
as of december   the company had approximately million of state net operating loss carryforwards that expire at various intervals between and the probability of not being able to utilize these operating loss carryforwards is low under a wide range of scenarios 
it is the company s policy to establish reserves for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of tax examinations 
the company establishes reserves for taxes based upon management s assessment of tax exposures under applicable accounting principles and pronouncements 
the tax reserves are analyzed on a quarterly basis and adjustments are recorded as events occur that warrant changes to individual exposure items and to the overall tax reserve balance 
the company is regularly audited by the internal revenue service irs and the various foreign and state tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which the company does business 
the irs has examined the company s tax returns through as of december   the company has recorded an appropriate reserve for exposures it has determined are probable 
pensions and other postretirement postemployment costs the company s employee pension and other postretirement postemployment benefit costs and obligations are dependent on its assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  salary growth  expected returns on plan assets  retirement rates  mortality rates and other factors 
the discount rate assumption reflects the rate that the liabilities could be settled on the measurement date of september th 
the company based this discount rate on investment yields available on aa rated corporate long term bond yields 
the duration of the aa bonds closely matches the duration of the company s pension liability 
the salary growth assumptions reflect the company s long term actual experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
the health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience 
mortality rates are based on published data 
actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense and recorded obligations in such future periods 
while the company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect pension and other postretirement postemployment benefit costs and obligations 
the company has determined that its net pension cost is projected to be approximately million in  compared to million in and million in based on a review of the current environment  the company has lowered its domestic and foreign long term rate of return assumptions used in determining net periodic pension expense from and  respectively  in to and  respectively  in and the company has further lowered the domestic return assumption to for a change in the long term rate of return assumption would increase or decrease net periodic pension expense by approximately million in the company lowered its domestic and foreign discount rates for determining net periodic pension expense from and  respectively  in to and  respectively  in further adjustments are being made in to lower the domestic rate to 
this adjustment reflects industry trends and the current interest rate environment 
a basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense by approximately million in and decrease the projected benefit obligation pbo by approximately million 
a basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately million in and increase the pbo by approximately million 
the company used september  as the measurement date for its assets and liabilities 
assets on this date were million 
the value of the assets increased to million at december  had december  assets been used to determine net periodic pension expense  pension expense would have decreased by approximately million 
the company expects its postretirement postemployment benefit costs to be million in forward looking statements this document contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements relate to analyses and other information that are based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable 
these statements also relate to future prospects  developments and business strategies 
these forward looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as anticipate  believe  could  estimate  expect  intend  may  plan  predict  project  will and similar terms and phrases  including references to assumptions 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  internal and external  that may cause the company s actual future activities and results of operations to be materially different from those suggested or described in this document 
internal risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially and negatively impact the company include the company s ability to achieve and execute internal business plans 
the company is currently engaged in formal productivity improvement plans in its appearance and performance technologies and environmental technologies segments that are expected to have a positive impact on earnings 
failure to achieve certain milestones would negatively impact the company 
the company is also engaged in growth initiatives in all technology segments  led by the strategic technologies group 
failure to commercialize proprietary and other technologies or to acquire businesses or licensing agreements to serve targeted markets would negatively impact the company 
future divestitures and restructurings 
the company may experience changes in market conditions that cause the company to consider divesting or restructuring operations  which could impact future earnings 
the success of research and development activities and the speed with which regulatory authorizations and product launches may be achieved 
the company s future cash flows depend upon the creation  acquisition and commercialization of new technologies 
manufacturing difficulties  property loss  or casualty loss 
although the company maintains business interruption insurance  the company is dependent upon the operating success of its manufacturing facilities  and does not maintain redundant capacity 
failure of these manufacturing facilities would cause short term profitability losses and could damage customer relations in the long term 
product quality deficiencies 
the company s products are generally sold based upon specifications agreed upon with our customers 
failure to meet these specifications could negatively impact the company 
the impact of physical inventory losses  particularly with regard to precious and base metals 
although the company maintains property and casualty insurance  the company holds large physical quantities of precious and base metals  often for the account of third parties 
these quantities are subject to loss by theft and manufacturing inefficiency 
litigation and legal claims 
the company is currently engaged in various legal disputes 
unfavorable resolution of these disputes would negatively impact the company 
still unidentified future legal claims could also negatively impact the company 
contingencies related to actual or alleged environmental contamination to which the company may be a party see note  environmental costs  as well as the section above 
exposure to product liability lawsuits 
external risks  uncertainties and changes in market conditions that could cause actual results to differ materially and negatively impact the company include competitive pricing or product development activities affecting demand for our products 
the company operates in a number of markets where overcapacity  low priced foreign competitors  and other factors create a situation where competitors compete for business by reducing their prices  notably the kaolin to paper market  some effect pigments markets  the colorant market  certain chemical process markets and certain components of the mobile source environmental markets 
overall demand for the company s products  which is dependent on the demand for our customers products 
as a supplier of materials to other manufacturers  the company is dependent upon the markets for its customers products 
additionally  technological advances by direct and not in kind competitors could render the company s current products obsolete 
changes in the solvency and liquidity of our customers 
although the company believes it has adequate credit policies  the creditworthiness of customers could change 
fluctuations in the supply and prices of precious and base metals and fluctuations in the relationships between forward prices to spot prices 
the company depends upon a reliable source of precious metals  used in the manufacture of its products  for itself and its customers 
these precious metals are sourced from a limited number of suppliers 
decrease in the availability of these precious metals could impact the profitability of the company 
a decrease in the availability or an increase in the cost of energy  notably natural gas 
the company consumes more than million mmbtus of natural gas annually 
compared to other sources of energy  natural gas is subject to volatility in availability and price  due to transportation  processing and storage requirements 
the availability and price of rare earth compounds 
the company uses certain rare earth compounds  produced in limited locations worldwide 
the availability and price of other raw materials 
the company s products contain a broad array of raw materials for which increases in price or decreases in availability could negatively impact the company 
the impact of increased employee benefit costs and or the resultant impact on employee relations and human resources 
the company employs over  employees worldwide and is subject to recent trends in benefit costs  notably medical benefits 
higher interest rates 
the majority of the company s debt is exposed to short term interest rate fluctuations 
an increase in long term debt rates would impact the company when the current long term debt instruments mature  or if the company requires additional long term debt 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company regularly enters into transactions denominated in foreign currencies  and accordingly is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s policy is to hedge the risks associated with monetary assets and liabilities resulting from these transactions 
additionally  the company has significant foreign currency investments and earnings  which are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates upon translation into us dollars 
geographic expansions not developing as anticipated 
the company expects markets in asia to fuel growth for many served markets 
china s expected growth exceeds that of most developed countries  and failure of that growth to materialize would negatively impact the company 
economic downturns and inflation 
the diversity of the company s markets has substantially insulated the company s profitability from economic downturns in recent years 
the company is exposed to overall economic condtions 
increased levels of worldwide political instability  as the company operates primarily in the united states  the european community  asia  the russian federation  south africa and brazil 
much of the company s identified growth prospects are foreign markets 
as such  the company expects continued foreign investment and  therefore  increased exposure to foreign political instability 
additionally  the worldwide threat of terrorism can directly and indirectly impact the company s foreign and domestic profitability 
the impact of the repeal of the us export sales tax incentive and the enactment of the american jobs creation act of the company is in the process of assessing the impact of these actions 
government legislation and or regulation particularly on environmental and taxation matters 
the company maintains manufacturing facilities and  as a result  is subject to environmental laws 
the company will be impacted by changes in these laws 
the company operates in tax jurisdictions throughout the world  and  as a result  is subject to changes in tax laws  notably in the united states  the united kingdom  germany  the netherlands  italy  switzerland  france  spain  south africa  brazil  mexico  china  korea  japan  india and thailand 
a slowdown in the expected rate of environmental requirements 
the company s environmental technologies segment s customers  and to a lesser extent  the process technologies segment s customers  are generally driven by increasingly stringent environmental regulations 
a slowdown or repeal of regulations could negatively impact the company 
investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon these forward looking statements  which speak only as of their dates 
the company disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive transactions the company is exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
in the normal course of business  the company uses a variety of techniques and instruments  including derivatives  as part of its overall risk management strategy 
the company enters into derivative agreements with a diverse group of major financial and other institutions with individually determined credit limits to reduce exposure to the risk of nonperformance by counterparties 
interest rate risk the company uses a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk of its debt related financial instruments and derivatives 
market risk is defined here as the potential change in the fair value of debt resulting from an adverse movement in interest rates 
the fair value of the company s total debt was million at december  and million at december   based on prevailing interest rates at those dates 
a basis point increase in interest rates could result in a reduction in the fair value of total debt of million at december   compared with million at december  the company also uses interest rate derivatives to help achieve its fixed and floating rate debt objectives 
the company currently has two interest rate swap agreements with a total notional value of million maturing in august  three interest rate swap agreements with a total notional value of million maturing in may and two interest rate swap agreements with a total notional value of million maturing in june these agreements effectively change fixed rate debt obligations into floating rate obligations 
the total notional values and maturity dates of these agreements are equal to the face values and the maturity dates of the related debt instruments 
in march  the company entered into an additional interest rate derivative contract 
this derivative  referred to as a forward rate agreement fra  economically hedged the company s interest rate exposure for the may  libor rate reset under a pre existing interest rate swap agreement 
this fra is marked to market with the gain loss being reflected in earnings 
in june  the company entered into two additional fra contracts  which economically hedged its interest rate exposure for the december  libor rate reset under a pre existing interest rate swap agreement 
this fra is marked to market with the gain loss being reflected in earnings 
in january  the company entered into two additional fra contracts  which economically hedged its interest rate exposure for the may  and the june  libor rate reset under two pre existing interest rate swap agreements 
these fras are marked to market with the gain loss being reflected in earnings 
approximately and of the company s borrowings had variable interest rates as of december  and  respectively 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company uses a variety of strategies  including foreign currency derivative contracts  to minimize or eliminate foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with its foreign currency transactions  including metal related transactions denominated in other than us dollars 
the company uses a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with its foreign currency transactions 
market risk is defined here as the potential change in fair value resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates 
a adverse movement in foreign currency rates could result in a net loss of million at december   compared with million at december   on the company s foreign currency derivative contracts 
however  since the company limits the use of foreign currency derivatives to the hedging of contractual and anticipated foreign currency payables and receivables  this loss in fair value for those instruments generally would be offset by a gain in the value of the underlying payable or receivable 
a adverse movement in foreign currency rates could result in an unrealized loss of million at december   compared with million at december   on the company s net investment in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates 
however  since the company views these investments as long term  the company would not expect such a gain or loss to be realized in the near term 
commodity price risk in closely monitored situations  for which exposure levels and transaction size limits have been set by senior management  the company  from time to time  holds large  unhedged industrial commodity positions that are subject to market price fluctuations 
such positions may include varying levels of derivative commodity instruments 
all unhedged industrial commodity transactions are monitored and marked to market daily 
all other industrial commodity transactions are hedged on a daily basis  using forward  future  option or swap contracts to substantially eliminate the exposure to price risk 
these positions are also marked to market daily 
the company performed a value at risk analysis on all of its metal related commodity assets and liabilities 
the value at risk calculation is a statistical model that uses historical price and volatility data to predict market risk on a one day interval with a confidence level 
while the value at risk models are relatively sophisticated  the quantitative information generated is limited by the historical information used in the calculation 
for example  the volatility in the platinum and palladium markets in and was much greater than historical norms 
therefore  the company uses this model only as a supplement to other risk management tools and not as a substitute for the experience and judgment of senior management and dealers who have extensive knowledge of the markets and adjust positions and revise strategies as the markets change 
based on the value at risk analysis in the context of a confidence level  the maximum potential one day loss in fair value was approximately million at december   compared with million as of december  the actual one day changes in fair value of the company s metal related commodity assets and liabilities never exceeded the average of the value at risk amounts as of the yearly open and close for each of the company s and fiscal years 
the company is also exposed to commodity price risk on the unhedged portion of its natural gas purchases related to its purchase of natural gas that is used in the manufacture of its products 
as of december   the company has hedged approximately of its expected natural gas purchases for at december   a uniform one dollar increase in the price of natural gas would result in a decrease in operating earnings of approximately million for the year ending december  based upon the company s unhedged portion of its expected natural gas purchases for
