item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes under item of this report 
overview the company is a multi bank holding company for two community oriented financial institutions  citizens first savings bank in port huron  michigan and metrobank in farmington hills  michigan 
metrobank was acquired by citizens first bancorp in january of as an opportunity to leverage capital provided from shareholders in and to gain access to wayne  oakland and northern macomb counties 
the banks offer a wide range of deposit and loan products to their customers 
in recent years  the company s strategy has been one of controlled balance sheet growth and broader diversification of its loan products and loan portfolio 
in recent years  the company has emphasized originating residential mortgage loans  commercial and multi family real estate loans  construction loans  commercial loans  automobile loans  home equity loans and lines of credit and a variety of consumer loans 
it has also emphasized increasing sources of noninterest income 
critical accounting policies management has established various accounting policies that govern how accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america are used to prepare the company s financial statements 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under item of this report 
certain accounting policies 
table of contents require management to make estimates and assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and as to which different estimates and assumptions would have a material impact on the carrying value of certain of the company s assets and liabilities  on the company s net income and on the company s overall financial condition and results of operations 
the estimates and assumptions management uses are based on historical experience and other factors  which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly as a result of these estimates and assumptions  and different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on the carrying value of certain of the company s assets and liabilities  on the company s net income and on the company s overall financial condition and results of operations for future reporting periods 
management believes that the company s critical accounting policies relate to the company s allowance for loan losses  its valuation of its mortgage servicing rights and goodwill and intangibles 
these policies are described in more detail below 
allowance for loan losses 
the company recognizes that losses will be experienced from originating loans and that the risk of loss will vary with  among other factors  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan  general economic conditions and  in the case of a secured loan  the quality of the security for the loan 
to reflect the perceived risk associated with the company s loan portfolio  the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb potential losses from loans in its loan portfolio 
as losses are estimated to have occurred  management establishes a provision for loan losses  which is charged directly against earnings 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is assured 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable losses based on information as of the date of the financial statements 
management evaluates whether the company s loan loss allowance is adequate at least quarterly by assessing the expected losses inherent in its loan portfolio 
management first reviews perceived higher risk loans  such as commercial and multi family real estate loans and loans with significant balances  and establishes an allowance for those loans 
second  management reviews loans that have deteriorated below certain levels of credit risk  including impaired  or likely uncollectible loans  and loans that have been classified as watch list loans  and attributes a specified loan loss allowance to these reviewed loans 
for additional information regarding how management determines whether a loan is impaired  or likely uncollectible  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
third  an appropriate level of loan loss is then determined for the remaining balance of the loan portfolio by applying varying loan loss factors 
management then analyzes whether the combined loan loss allowance is adequate by considering other factors that may have an impact on the performance of the loan portfolio  such as trends in real estate and collateral values  and adjusts the overall loan loss allowance 
no assurances can be given that the company s level of allowance for loan losses will be sufficient to cover future loan losses incurred by the company or that future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses will be unnecessary if economic and other conditions differ substantially from the economic and other conditions used by management to determine the current level of the allowance for loan losses or if historical trends change 
nevertheless  management believes that  based on information currently available  the company s allowance for loan losses is sufficient to cover losses inherent in its loan portfolio at this time 
in addition  it is uncertain whether various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process and in reviewing the company s loan portfolio  will request that the company increase its allowance for loan losses 
the company believes  however  that it has established its existing loan loss allowance in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
these agencies could  nevertheless  require the company to provide additions to the allowance for loan losses based upon judgments of the agencies that are different from the judgments of management 
in the last few years  the percentage of the loan loss allowance to total loans has decreased 
the company reviews the allowance for loan losses on a monthly basis and establishes a provision based on actual and estimated losses inherent in the portfolio 
because the estimates and assumptions underlying the company s allowance for loan losses are inherently uncertain  different estimates and assumptions could require a material increase in the allowance for loan losses 
any material increase in the allowance in the allowance for loan losses could have a material adverse effect on the company s net income and results of operations 
valuation of mortgage servicing rights 
the company routinely sells its originated residential mortgage loans to investors  mainly freddie mac 
although the company sells the mortgage loans  it frequently retains the servicing rights  or the rights to collect payments and otherwise service these loans  for an administrative or servicing fee 
the mortgage loans that the company services for others are not included as assets in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
loans serviced for others were approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the company s mortgage servicing rights relating to loans serviced for others represent an asset of the company 
this asset is initially capitalized and included in other assets on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the mortgage servicing rights are then amortized against noninterest income in proportion to  and over the period of  the estimated future net servicing income of the 
table of contents underlying mortgage servicing rights 
there are a number of factors  however  that can affect the ultimate value of the mortgage servicing rights to the company  including the estimated prepayment speed of the loan and the discount rate used to present value the loan 
for example  if the mortgage loan is prepaid  the company will receive fewer servicing fees  meaning that the present value of the mortgage servicing rights is less than the carrying value of those rights on the company s balance sheet 
therefore  in an attempt to reflect an accurate expected value to the company of the mortgage servicing rights  the company receives a valuation of its mortgage servicing rights from an independent third party 
the independent third party s valuation of the mortgage servicing rights is based on relevant characteristics of the company s loan servicing portfolio  such as loan terms  interest rates and recent prepayment experience  as well as current market interest rate levels  market forecasts and other economic conditions 
based upon the independent third party s valuation of the company s mortgage servicing rights  management then establishes a valuation allowance  if necessary  to quantify the likely impairment of the value of the mortgage servicing rights to the company 
the estimates of prepayment speeds and discount rates are inherently uncertain  and different estimates could have a material impact on the company s net income and results of operations 
the valuation allowance is evaluated and adjusted quarterly by management to reflect changes in the fair value of the underlying mortgage servicing rights based on market conditions 
the balances of the company s capitalized mortgage servicing rights  net of valuation allowance  included in the company s other assets at december  and december  were million and million  respectively 
the fair value of the company s mortgage servicing rights exceeds the carrying value at these dates 
the fair values of the company s mortgage servicing rights were determined using annual constant prepayment speeds of and and discount rates of and at december  and december   respectively 
constant prepayment speeds are a statistical measure of the historical or expected prepayment of principal on a mortgage 
different estimates of the prepayment speeds and discount rates or different assumptions could have a material impact on the value of the mortgage servicing rights and  therefore  on the company s valuation allowance 
for further discussion of the company s valuation allowance and valuation of mortgage servicing rights  including a table setting forth the valuation allowances established by management with regard to the company s mortgage servicing rights for the previous three periods  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
as can be seen in that table  prepayments have decreased and discount rates have increased over the past twelve months 
as a result of the combined effect of these conditions  the estimated fair value of the company s mortgage servicing rights has increased 
goodwill and intangibles 
goodwill and intangibles arising from business acquisitions represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired 
the fair value of goodwill and intangibles is dependent upon many factors  including the company s ability to provide quality  cost effective services in the face of competition from other financial institutions 
a decline in earnings as a result of business or market conditions  a lack of growth or the company s inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill and intangibles which could adversely impact earnings in future periods 
the company s goodwill and intangibles relate to the acquisition premium recorded when purchasing banking businesses 
goodwill and intangibles are reviewed periodically for impairment by comparing the fair value of the company to the book value of the company 
if the book value is in excess of the fair value  impairment is indicated and the goodwill and or intangibles must be written down to its fair value 
the annual test of goodwill and intangibles impairment was and will be performed during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year beginning in  in accordance with sfas no 
for a further discussion of the company s goodwill and intangibles  refer to note to the company s consolidated financial statements under item of this report 
comparison of financial condition at december  and total assets 
total assets increased million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december   primarily due to the acquisition in january of metrobank  a bank in farmington hills  michigan with assets of million that are included in the growth discussed below by category 
a million  or  increase in loans  which is explained in more detail below  an million  or  increase in securities available for sale consisting primarily of o a million increase in mortgage backed securities due to the acquisition of metrobank o a million increase in obligations of state and political subdivisions o a million increase in us treasury securities and obligations of us government corporations and agencies offset by o a million decrease in corporate debt securities 
the increase in obligations of state and political subdivisions and us treasury securities and obligations of us government corporations and agencies and the overall decrease in corporate debt securities was due to managements desire to align the portfolio to higher yielding state  local and us government securities and lower the overall risk inherent in the portfolio by selling many  of its corporate debt securities during the year 

table of contents additional changes in total assets consisted of a million  or  increase in premises and equipment  due to the purchase of land for future branch expansion in the company s market area  the remodeling of the company s main office and additional capital improvements as a result of remodeling of our other branches  a million  or  increase in federal home loan bank stock  due to increased borrowings from the federal home loan bank of indianapolis fhlb  which  in turn  required an increased investment in fhlb stock  and a million  or  increase in accrued interest and other assets 
the increases in assets described above were partially offset by the following decreases in assets at december   as compared to assets at december  a million  or  decrease in loans held for sale  due to differences in timing of loan sales  a million  or  decrease in cash and cash equivalents primarily due to a million decrease in interest bearing deposits in other depository institutions  a million decrease in cash and due from other depository institutions  and a million decrease in federal funds sold 
the increase in securities available for sale was primarily due to the purchase of metrobank which provided approximately million in securities available for sale offset by the sale of securities to fund loan growth 
similarly  the decrease in interest bearing deposits in other depository institutions was mainly to fund loan growth 
the company s net loans to assets ratio at december  was compared to at december   as a result of the million increase in loans referred to above 
the increase in loans was a result of the company s purchase of metrobank which provided million in gross loans and the company s operating strategy of controlled balance sheet growth and consisted primarily of a million  or  increase in one to four family mortgage loans to million  a million  or  increase in commercial real estate loans to million  a million  or  increase in commercial loans to million  a million  or  increase in construction loans to million  a million  or  increase in home equity loans and lines of credit to million  a million  or  increase in automobile loans to million  and a million  or a  increase in other consumer loans to million 
the increase in commercial and commercial real estate loans was primarily due to the acquisition of metrobank along with the development of new business relationships and growth of existing clients 
the increase in consumer loans was a result of ongoing efforts to emphasize growth in shorter term commercial and consumer loan products 
total liabilities 
total liabilities increased million  or  from million at december  to billion at december  the increase was primarily due to the following a million  or  increase in deposits from million at december  to million at december   a million  or  increase in borrowed funds to fund loan growth consisted of o a million  or  increase in federal home loan bank advances from million at december  to million at december  o a million line of credit advance from our correspondent bank  and o a million  or increase in federal funds purchased and a million increase in accrued interest payable and other liabilities 
the overall increase in deposits were primarily invested in loans 
the increases in deposits were a result of the company s acquisition of metrobank  which provided million in deposits and its operating strategy of controlled balance sheet growth along with a greater emphasis on building relationships with new and existing customers 
the million increase in deposits at december  compared to december  was comprised of the following components an increase in noninterest bearing deposits of million  or  an increase in now checking accounts of million  or  an increase in certificates of deposit of million  or  and 
table of contents an increase in passbook and savings deposits of million  or 
the increases in the certificates of deposit accounts were primarily due to lower overall rates in short term accounts 
the growth in noninterest bearing deposits was partially due to growth in business deposit accounts as part of our ongoing effort to attract and retain deposit relationships with businesses throughout our market area 
the increase in deposits at december   as compared to at december   was partially offset by a decrease in money market deposit accounts of million  or due to lower market rates and to customers transferring deposits to higher earning certificates of deposit 
quality of assets 
nonperforming loans were of total assets at december   compared to at december  nonperforming loans increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this increase in nonperforming loans was partially due to the acquisition of metrobank which provided approximately million of the million increase in nonperforming commercial loans  a million increase in nonperforming real estate loans and a million increase in nonperforming consumer loans as a result of an extended period of poor general economic conditions and a statewide unemployment rate that is higher than the national average 
additionally  the increase in nonperforming real estate and consumer loans was partially attributable to a change in policy in regards to the criteria necessary to classify a loan as performing or nonperforming 
see the loans section of note to the company s consolidated financial statements under item of this report for more information 
nonperforming assets  which includes not only nonperforming loans  but also real estate owned by the company after foreclosure  increased million  or  to million  or of total assets  at december   as compared to million  or  of total assets at december  this increase in nonperforming assets was due to the increase in nonperforming loans described above along with a nominal  increase in other real estate owned 
the allowance for loan losses was million at december  and million at december   or of total loans and of nonperforming loans at december   as compared to of total loans and of nonperforming loans at december  the company s allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain 
use of a different amount for the allowance could have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
for more information on how the amount of this allowance is determined  please see the caption critical accounting policies in this section management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
stockholders equity 
stockholders equity increased million from million at december  to million  as a result of the addition of net income of million  a million increase in unearned compensation for esop and a  increase in deferred compensation which represents deferred fees owed to members of the board of directors 
these increases were partially offset by a million increase in treasury shares and a million  or  decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income from the unrealized gains or losses on securities 
average balances  interest and average yields cost the following table presents certain information for the years indicated regarding average balances of assets and liabilities  as well as the total dollar amounts of interest income from average interest earning assets and interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities and the resulting average yields and costs 
the yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balances of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the years presented 
average balances were derived from monthly balances

table of contents comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and net income 
the decrease in net income for the year was primarily due to a million  or increase in interest expense  a million  or decrease in noninterest income combined with a million  or increase in noninterest expenses  which was primarily due to a million  or increase in compensation and employee benefits  a million  or increase in occupancy expenses and a million  or  increase in professional fees  a  or  increase in stationery  printing and supplies  a  increase in data processing  a  charge for core deposit intangible amortization  a  or  increase in advertising and a million  or  increase in other noninterest expenses 
contributing to the decrease in noninterest income was a million  or  decrease in income from mortgage banking activities due to the dropoff of refinancing of residential mortgage loans and a  or decrease in other noninterest income offset by a million  or  increase in service charges and other fees  a  or  increase in gains on securities available for sale  a  increase in loan servicing fees and a  or  increase in trust fee income 
these increases and decreases are explained in more detail below 
net interest income 
net interest income  before provision for loan loss  increased by million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase consisted primarily of a million  or  increase in total interest income to million for the year ended december   from million for the twelve months ended december   which is explained in detail below  offset by  a million  or  increase in total interest expense to million for the year ended december   from million for the twelve months ended december   which is explained in detail below 
the million increase in total interest income for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   was comprised primarily of a million  or  increase in interest income on loans  primarily due to the addition of million of loans from metrobank that provided million in interest income offset by a basis point reduction in average yields on loans  and a  or  increase in interest income on tax exempt securities  primarily due to a basis point reduction in the average yield on securities offset by a million increase in the average balance of securities  offset by a  or  decrease in income from taxable securities due to lower average balances  and a  decrease in income from federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits  primarily due to lower average balances 
average interest earning assets increased million primarily due to the acquisition of metrobank and loan growth at citizens first resulting in a million  or  increase in the average balance of loans  which we funded by deposit growth and increased borrowings 
the million increase in total interest expense for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   was comprised primarily of a  or  aggregate increase in interest expense on savings  now and money market deposit accounts  and  a million  or  increase in interest expense on federal home loan bank advances and other borrowings to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily due to a million increase in the average balance of federal home loan bank advances and other borrowings  which was partially offset by a basis point decrease in average interest rates on those advances 
earning asset yields have declined by approximately basis points over the last year 
net interest margin continues to compress as existing loans refinance and new loans  mainly commercial and consumer  that are indexed to prime are added to the portfolio 
we believe that this compression could continue until such time as these indexes begin to rise 
the possibility exists and has shown some indication in the first two months of that rates on deposits could rise sooner than rates on loans further compressing net interest margin 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses increased  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increased provision for loan losses is the result of a million increase in nonperforming loans due to a change in policy see note and the  or  increase in net charge offs for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as a result of the increase in nonperforming loans and net charge offs  
table of contents management felt an increased provision was warranted 
despite the increased provision  the loan loss allowance as a percentage of total loans decreased from at december  to at december   and the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans decreased from at december  to at december   in each case primarily as a result of the significant increase in the size of the company s loan portfolio 
noninterest income 
noninterest income decreased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  metrobank provided a total of  or of the total in noninterest income 
the overall decrease was primarily due to the following changes between the year ended december  and the year ended december  a million  or  increase in service charges and other fees  a  or  increase in the gain on sales of securities available for sale used to fund loan growth  a  or increase in loan servicing fees  and a  increase in trust fee income 
these increases were offset by a million  or  decrease in mortgage banking activities  due to decreased sales of fixed rate one to four family loans and a one time charge of approximately  in the first quarter to the custodial account for the servicing of loans sold to freddie mac 
as discussed in the form k for the year ended december  and as expected by management  the volume of refinancing of mortgage loans significantly decreased due to the economic conditions experienced during mortgage banking activities were effected due to the prime rate increase of basis points from december  to december  while noninterest income showed significant decreases during the period  much of the decrease was due to the large reduction of refinancings and subsequent sales of long term  fixed rate one to four family residential mortgage loans 
we do not expect this downward trend to continue and cannot speculate as to whether the number of refinancings or possible loan sales would provide additional income in noninterest expense 
noninterest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   of which metrobank contributed million  or of total noninterest expense 
the increase in noninterest expense primarily due to the following an increase of million  or  in compensation  payroll taxes and employee benefit expenses  due primarily to million additional expenses for staff acquired in the metrobank transaction offset by decreased compensation expenses at citizens  a million  or  increase in occupancy and equipment expense due partially to additional branches and million in additional expenses for metrobank  a  or  increase in advertising and business promotion expense  due to increased advertising efforts by the company  a  or  increase in stationery  printing and supplies   of which related to metrobank  a  or  increase due to a full year of using fiserv for data processing  a  charge for core deposit intangible amortization for the deposits acquired in the metrobank transaction  a million  or  increase in professional fees  due to the increased costs associated with being a public company  including compliance costs associated with the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act of including charges for compliance with section and  a million  or  increase in other noninterest expenses  of which approximately  related to metrobank and other general increases in noninterest expense 
these increases were offset by a  or  decrease in deposit statement preparation due to  and a  decrease in appraisal fees due to the reduced number of one to four family residential mortgage loan closings 

table of contents we are continuing to renovate the interiors of a few of the branch offices and we have renovated three floors of the main office to make them more conducive to sales and service 
this investment  along with other ongoing investments in training and the conversion of metrobank to the fiserv iti data processing system is expected to increase office occupancy and other expenses in the near term 
income taxes 
federal income taxes for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from million for the year ended december  the effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
included in federal income taxes at december  is a reserve for the realization of a portion of the company s contribution carry forward for tax purposes  which expires in fiscal realization of this contribution carry forward is based on the generation of sufficient taxable income prior to the carry forwards expiration 
during  management determined  based on projected taxable income levels through  that the entire amount of the carry forward is not expected to be used 
therefore  management recorded a  valuation allowance because it is more likely than not that the full contribution carry forward will not be utilized prior to its expiration 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and net income 
net income increased  or  for the year ended december  to million as compared to million for the twelve months ended december   resulting in net earnings of per basic share 
the increase in net income for the year was primarily due to a million  or  increase in net interest income discussed below and to a million  or increase in noninterest income  partially offset by a million  or  increase in noninterest expenses  which was primarily due to a million  or increase in compensation and employee benefits  a  or increase in occupancy expenses and a  or  increase in professional fees  a  or  increase in other noninterest expenses along with a  or  increase in advertising 
contributing to the increase in noninterest income were a million  or  increase in income from mortgage banking activities  a  or  increase in loan servicing fees and a  or  increase in other noninterest income 
these increases are explained in more detail below 
net interest income 
net interest income  before provision for loan loss  increased by million to million for the year ended december   from million for the twelve months ended december  the increase in net interest income  before provision for loan loss  consisted primarily of a million  or  decrease in total interest income to million for the twelve ended december   from million for the twelve months ended december   which is explained in detail below  offset by  a million  or  decrease in total interest expense to million for the year ended december   from million for the twelve months ended december   which is explained in detail below 
the million decrease in total interest income for the year ended december   compared to the twelve months ended december   was comprised primarily of a million  or  decrease in interest income on taxable securities  primarily due to a basis point reduction in the average yield on securities offset by a million increase in the average balance 
average interest earning assets increased million primarily due to a million  or  increase in the average balance of loans  which occurred as a result of the growth in deposits and the decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
the million decrease in total interest expense for the year ended december   compared to the twelve months ended december   was comprised primarily of a million  or  aggregate decrease in interest expense on savings  now  money market deposit accounts and certificate of deposit accounts 
earning asset yields have declined by approximately basis points over the last twelve months 
net interest margin continues to compress as existing loans refinance and new loans  mainly commercial and consumer  that are indexed to prime are added to the portfolio 
we believe that this compression could continue until such time as these indexes begin to rise 
the possibility exists that rates on deposits could rise sooner than rates on loans further compressing net interest margin 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses increased  or  from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increased provision for loan losses is the result of a million increase in non performing loans 
as a result of the increase in non performing loans and net charge offs  management felt an increased provision was warranted 
despite the increased provision  the loan loss allowance as a percentage of total loans decreased from at december  to at december   and the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non performing loans decreased from at december  to at december   in each case primarily as a result of the significant increase in the size of the company s loan portfolio 

table of contents noninterest income 
noninterest income increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the following a million  or  increase in mortgage banking activities  due to increased sales of fixed rate one to four family loans  which occurred as a result of an increased volume of refinancings 
the rights to service these loans and the income associated with those rights were retained by the company 
the following factors contributed to the increased sale of loans during the year ended december  during the year ended december   the company originated million of one to four family residential mortgage loans  an increase of million  or  from million of one to four family residential mortgage loans originated by the company for the year ended december  at december   the company had million of one to four family residential mortgage loans held for sale  an increase of  or  from million of one to four family residential mortgage loans held for sale by the company at december   a  or  increase in loan servicing fees due to the increase in loans sold with servicing retained  and a  or  increase in other noninterest income  partially offset by  a  or  decrease in service charges and other fees  and a  or  decrease in gain on sale of securities 
as indicated above  much of the increase was due to the large number of refinancings and subsequent sales of long term  fixed rate one to four family residential mortgage loans 
generally  many of the customers that could have refinanced their loan during the period have done so 
we do not expect the number of refinancings and gains on sale that are included in line item mortgage banking activities subsequent to those refinancings to repeat to the same extent in this possible reduction in noninterest income could have a significant impact on earnings in future quarterly periods and in the year ended december  noninterest expense 
noninterest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the twelve months ended december   primarily due to the following an increase of million  or  in compensation  payroll taxes and employee benefit expenses  due to an increase in commissions to lending personnel as a result of increased loan production volumes  increased benefit costs and a increase in the number of employees  a  or  increase in occupancy and equipment expense due partially to additional branches and the disposal of abandoned assets  a  or  increase in advertising and business promotion expense  due to increased advertising efforts by the company  and a  or  increase in other noninterest expenses 
these increases were offset by a  or  decrease in stationery  printing and supplies 
we continue to renovate the interiors of many of the branch offices and we have begun to renovate the main office to make them more conducive to sales and service 
this investment  along with other ongoing investments in training  is expected to increase office occupancy and other expenses in the near term 
income taxes 
federal income taxes for the year ended december  were million  an increase of  or  from million for the twelve months ended december  the effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources general 
based on the following  the company considers its liquidity and capital resources sufficient to meet its outstanding short term and long term needs 

table of contents liquidity is the company s ability to meet its current and future needs for cash 
the company further defines liquidity as the ability to have funds available  without incurring excessive cost  to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers and to satisfy its financial commitments  as well as maintaining the flexibility to take advantage of investment opportunities 
many factors affect a company s ability to meet its liquidity needs  including variation in the markets served  the company s asset liability mix  its reputation and credit standing in the market and general economic conditions 
the company s primary sources of funds consist of deposits  loan repayments  payments of interest on loans  proceeds from the sale of loans originated for sale  maturities and sales of investment securities and borrowings from the fhlb or correspondent banks  cash on hand and cash on deposit 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows  loan prepayments  and mortgage loan originations and sales are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition

under the terms of the agreement  the company is required to be categorized as well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
if the company falls below this category  the line of credit would be terminated and become immediately due

the company is considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements under item of this report 
new accounting standards 
there were several new accounting standards which were issued or became effective in  in addition to some which have later effective dates 
those that are applicable to the company are listed and discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements under item of this report 
effect of inflation and changing prices 
the company s consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations and in increased loan amounts and in increased interest rates which must include a real rate of return and an additional amount to reflect expected inflation over the term of the loan 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of interest rate risk and market risk analysis qualitative aspects of market risk 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
sudden fluctuations in market interest rates are inherently uncertain and could have a negative impact on the earnings of the company to the extent that the interest rates on assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent or on the same basis 
for example  the company s assets include a large number of fixed rate mortgage loans 
as a result  during periods of rising interest rates  there is a risk that the company s interest expense will increase faster than its interest income 
the company s principal objectives regarding interest rate risk management are to evaluate regularly the interest rate risk inherent in certain balance sheet accounts  to determine the level of risk appropriate given the company s financial condition and outlook  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives and to manage interest rate risk consistent with the company s board of directors approved guidelines 
the company has an asset liability management committee that is responsible for accomplishing the principal objectives of interest rate risk management 
the committee regularly reviews the company s guidelines and strategies affecting the company s asset liability management related activities to determine if they are adequate based on estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits set by the company s board and overall market interest rate levels and trends 
the committee is composed of members of management and the company s board of directors and regularly meets to review the company s asset liability mix 
it also reports trends  interest rate risk position and results of current interest rate risk management strategies and recommends any changes to strategies to the board of directors quarterly 
in recent years  the company has used the following strategies to manage interest rate risk emphasizing the origination of adjustable rate loans and the sale of longer term  fixed rate loans  emphasizing shorter term consumer loans  maintaining a high quality portfolio of short to intermediate term securities  maintaining high levels of liquidity  and using fhlb advances and other borrowings to better structure the maturities of its interest rate sensitive liabilities 
adverse market interest rate changes between the time that a customer receives a rate lock commitment on a mortgage and when the fully funded mortgage loan is sold to an investor can erode the value of that mortgage 
the company enters into forward sales contracts in order to mitigate this particular interest rate risk 
the company accepts credit risk in forward sales contracts should the other party default  in which case the company would be compelled to sell the mortgages to another party at the current market price 
therefore  if market interest rates increased from the date of the forward sales contract and the other party defaulted  the company would most likely have to sell the mortgage to another party at a lower price  which would reduce earnings or create losses on this mortgage 
more recently  the company has used some of its excess liquidity to increase its loan and securities portfolios 
as liquidity is reduced  the company s sensitivity to interest rate movements is expected to increase 
the notional and estimated fair value of the company s forward sales contracts used to manage risk positions associated with residential mortgage loans were as follows quantitative aspects of market risk 
the company uses a simulation model based on discounted cash flows to measure the potential impact on its net interest income of hypothetical changes in market interest rates 
the model forecasts the company s net interest income for the next year assuming that there are no changes in interest rates or the mix of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet from the end of the prior period 
after this initial forecast  the model subjects the balance sheet to instantaneous and sustained rate changes of and basis points to the treasury yield curve 
in order to determine the possible effect of the rate changes  the model uses various assumptions 
among others  these assumptions relate to the following the shape of the yield curve  the pricing characteristics of and pricing decisions regarding loans based on previous rates charged by the company  changes in deposits and borrowings based on previous rates charged by the company and other competitive conditions  reinvestments of cash flows from assets and liabilities based on current market interest rates  
table of contents the lack of any changes in the mix of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet  the degree to which certain assets and liabilities with similar maturities or periods to repricing react to changes in market interest rates based on particular characteristics of those assets and liabilities  expected prepayment rates on loans and investments based on industry standards and the current interest rate environment  certificates of deposit and other deposit flows based on expected maturity dates  and expected growth based on the company s projections 
the table below sets forth  as of december   estimated net interest income and the estimated changes in the company s net interest income for the next twelve month period that could occur as a result of instantaneous changes in market interest rates of and basis points estimated change in annual net interest income increase decrease in market interest at december  dollars in thousands rates in basis points rate shock amount change change static the above table indicates that in the event of a sudden and sustained decline in prevailing market interest rates  the company s net interest income would be expected to decrease 
as noted above  computation of the prospective effect of hypothetical interest rate changes is based on a number of assumptions 
the calculation of the interest rate sensitivity of the company could vary significantly if different assumptions were used  or if the company s response to changes in interest rates included changes in the mix of assets and liabilities in its balance sheet 
other shortcomings also exist in the table 
these shortcomings include the following  among others although certain assets may have similar maturities or repricing characteristics  they may react in different degrees to changes in interest rates 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
certain assets  such as adjustable rate  residential mortgage loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of repayments on loans and early withdrawals from time deposits could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
if interest rates increased  it is also possible that the increased mortgage payments required of certain borrowers could result in an increase in delinquencies and defaults 
changes in interest rates could also affect the volume and profitability of the company s lending operations 
as a result of these and other shortcomings in the model determining the prospective effects of interest rate changes  the computations in the table should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results in the event of changes in market interest rates 
further  the computations do not reflect any actions that management may undertake to respond to changes in interest rates 
forward sales contracts as of december  have settlement dates of less than days 
the weighted average settlement interest rate for these contracts was
