overview we provide a wide range of environmental services and solutions to a diversified customer base in the united states  puerto rico  mexico and canada 
we seek to be recognized by customers as the premier supplier of a broad range of value added environmental services based upon quality  responsiveness  customer service  information technologies  breadth of product offerings and cost effectiveness 
in february  we initiated the acquisition of the csd assets  which was completed effective september  that acquisition broadened our disposal capabilities  geographic reach and significantly expanded our network of hazardous waste disposal facilities 
following the acquisition  we became one of the largest providers of environmental services and the largest operator of hazardous waste treatment and disposal facilities in north america 
we believe that the acquisition of hazardous waste facilities in new geographic areas has allowed and will continue to allow us to expand our service area and has resulted and will continue to result in significant cost savings by allowing us to treat and dispose of hazardous waste internally for which we previously paid third parties and eliminate redundant selling  general and administrative expenses and inefficient transportation costs 
we believe that significant synergies can be achieved by further integrating the former csd operations into our business 
since the effective date of the acquisition  we have reduced and plan to continue to reduce expenses by use of common information management systems to minimize disposal costs outside the integrated network of facilities by sending waste to the disposal facilities that we now own 
we also have eliminated and plan to continue to eliminate duplicate costs relating to overlapping operations on a geographic basis 
although much of the integration of operations and reduction of the combined entities operating costs has been completed  this process is still ongoing 
in addition  as part of the acquisition  we assumed certain environmental liabilities valued in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap and a plan to settle obligations that was established at the time of the acquisition and adjusted to reflect information gathered under the plan through the first anniversary of the acquisition relating to the nature and extent of environmental liabilities that existed as of the acquisition date of approximately million 
we now anticipate such liabilities will be payable over many years and that cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to fund the payment of such liabilities when required 
however  events not now anticipated such as future changes in environmental laws and regulations could require that such payments be made earlier or in greater amounts than now anticipated 
acquisition effective september   we purchased from safety kleen services  inc the seller and certain of the seller s domestic subsidiaries substantially all of the assets of the chemical services division the csd of safety kleen corp 
safety kleen 
the csd acquisition is included in our results of operations since the acquisition date 
the sale included the operating assets of certain of the seller s subsidiaries in the united states and the stock of five of the seller s subsidiaries in canada 
the assets of the csd including the assets of the csd canadian subsidiaries which we acquired consist primarily of hazardous waste treatment and disposal facilities including  among others  transportation  storage or disposal facilities six of which have since been closed by us  six wastewater treatment facilities one of which has since been closed by us  nine commercial landfills and four incineration facilities 
such facilities are located in states  puerto rico  six canadian provinces and mexico 
the most significant of such facilities include landfills in buttonwillow  california with approximately million cubic yards of remaining capacity  in lambton  ontario with approximately million cubic yards of remaining capacity  which is the largest of the total of three hazardous waste landfills in canada  and in waynoka  oklahoma with approximately million cubic yards of remaining capacity  and incinerators in deer park  texas which is the largest hazardous waste incineration facility in the united states  and in aragonite  utah 
additional significant facilities are the incinerators in mercier  quebec and lambton  ontario 
the acquired assets do not include safety kleen s pinewood landfill in south carolina  which safety kleen had previously operated as part of the csd 
the primary reasons for the acquisition of the csd assets were to broaden our disposal capabilities and geographic reach  particularly in the west coast and southwest regions of the united states  in canada and in mexico  and to significantly expand our network of hazardous waste disposal facilities 
in addition  we believed that the acquisition of the csd s hazardous waste facilities in new geographic areas would allow us to expand its site and industrial services which in turn could increase the utilization and profitability of the facilities 
finally  we believed that the acquisition would result in significant cost savings by allowing us to treat hazardous waste internally  for which we previously paid third parties to dispose of hazardous waste because we lacked the facilities required to dispose of the waste internally 
in accordance with the acquisition agreement between the seller and us dated february   as amended through september   we purchased the assets of the csd for million in net cash  and incurred direct costs related to the transaction of million for a total purchase price of million 
in addition  we assumed with the transaction certain environmental liabilities valued at million 
we have allocated the total purchase price for the csd assets based upon the estimated fair value of each asset acquired and each liability assumed 
the following table shows the final allocation of the purchase price and direct costs incurred among the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and liabilities accrued relating to the csd assets acquired in thousands acquired assets and liabilities as revised december  current assets  property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  deferred taxes  other assets  current closure  post closure and remedial liabilities  other current liabilities  closure  post closure and remedial liabilities  long term  other long term liabilities  cost of csd assets acquired  cash purchase price  estimated transaction costs  cost of csd assets acquired  we engaged an independent appraisal firm to assist in determining the fair values of the property  plant  equipment and intangible assets  which were acquired as part of the assets of the csd 
intangible assets recorded at million consist of million of permits and million of customer profile databases 
the valuation for intangible assets was based on discounted cash flows from operations of the acquired facilities to which those permits and customer profile databases relate 
we concluded that the intangible assets acquired have finite lives and will amortize these assets over their estimated useful lives 
as the fair value of the assets acquired from the csd is higher than the purchase price paid  we reduced the recorded value of the fixed assets and intangible assets as of the acquisition date by million in order to record the assets at cost as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states after adjusting for changes in estimates 
we allocated million of the purchase price to properties held for sale as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
in connection with the acquisition of the csd assets  we recorded integration liabilities of million after giving effect to subsequent net changes in estimates which consisted primarily of lease costs  severance  environmental closure and other exit costs to close duplicative facilities and functions 
groups of employees severed and to be severed consist primarily of duplicative selling  general and administrative personnel and personnel at offices which were closed

the following are the areas that we believe require the greatest amount of judgments or estimates in the preparation of the financial statements revenue allowance  deferred revenue  allowance for doubtful accounts  accounting for landfills  testing assets for impairment  environmental liabilities  insurance expense  legal matters  and provision for income taxes 
prior to the completion and filing of this annual report on form k  the audit committee of our board of directors reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and discussed them with our management 
revenue allowance 
we respond to emergencies that pose an immediate threat to public health or the environment and must take action in the field as events unfold 
historically  once the emergency is contained  customers may withhold payment and attempt to renegotiate amounts invoiced 
credits issued in subsequent periods can differ materially from the revenue allowance provided 
we establish a revenue allowance to cover the estimated amounts of revenue that may need to be credited to customers accounts in future periods 
the allowance is established based on experience and  when available  based on specific information relating to jobs performed 
deferred revenue 
in accordance with customary practice in the environmental services industry  we normally submit a bill for services shortly after waste is collected from a customer location and prior to completion of the waste disposal process 
we recognize revenue for waste disposal services only when the waste is placed into a landfill  incinerated  treated in a wastewater treatment facility or shipped to a third party for disposal 
the amount of deferred revenue stated on our balance sheet as of december  was million 
because a large quantity of waste is on hand and in transit at the end of any month  waste from various sources is mixed subsequent to receipt  waste is received in various size containers  and the amount of waste per container can vary significantly  the calculation of deferred revenue requires the use of significant estimates such as of the average revenue charged for a type of waste and of the average waste volume contained within various size containers 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to cover accounts receivable that may not be collectible 
in establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze the collectibility of accounts that are large or past due 
in addition  we consider historical bad debts and current economic trends in evaluating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable written off in subsequent periods can differ materially from the allowance for doubtful accounts provided 
accounting for landfills 
we utilize the life cycle method of accounting for landfill costs and the units of consumption method to amortize landfill construction and asset retirement costs and record closure and post closure obligations over the estimated remaining useful life of a landfill 
under this method  we include future estimated construction and asset retirement costs  as well as costs incurred to date  in the amortization base 
additionally  we include probable expansion airspace that has yet to be permitted costs in the calculation of the total remaining useful life of the landfill 
this accounting method requires us to make estimates and assumptions  as described below 
any changes in our estimates will impact our income from operations prospectively from the date the changes are made 
landfill assets we assess the total cost to develop each landfill site to its capacity based on highly probable airspace 
this includes certain projected landfill costs that are uncertain because they are dependent on future events 
the total cost to develop a site to its final capacity includes amounts previously expended and capitalized  net of accumulated airspace amortization  and projections of future purchase and development costs and construction costs 
closure and post closure costs the costs for closure and post closure obligations at landfills we own or operate are estimated based on our interpretations of current requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory changes 
the estimates for landfill cell closure  final closure and post closure costs also consider when the costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates 
the possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forward looking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption uncertain 
available airspace our engineers and accountants determine the useful life of our landfills by estimating the available airspace 
this is done by using surveys and other methods to calculate  based on height restrictions and other factors  how much airspace is left to fill and how much waste can be disposed of at a landfill before it has reached its final capacity 
expansion airspace we apply a comprehensive set of criteria for evaluating the probability of obtaining a permit for future expansion airspace at existing sites  which provides management a sufficient basis to evaluate the likelihood of success of unpermitted expansions 
these criteria are as follows personnel are actively working to obtain the permit or permit modifications land use  state and federal necessary for expansion of an existing landfill  and progress is being made on the project 
we expect to submit the application within the next year and expect to receive all necessary approvals to accept waste within the next five years 
at the time the expansion is included in our estimate of the landfill s useful economic life  it is probable that the required approvals will be received within the normal application and processing time periods for approvals in the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located 
we expect to submit the application within the next year and expect to receive all necessary approvals to accept waste within the next five years 
the owner of the landfill or we have a legal right to use or obtain land associated with the expansion plan 
there are no significant known political  technical  legal  or business restrictions or issues that could impair the success of such expansion 
a financial feasibility analysis has been completed and the results demonstrate that the expansion has a positive financial and operational impact such that management is committed to pursuing the expansion 
additional airspace and related additional costs  including permitting  final closure and post closure costs  have been estimated based on the conceptual design of the proposed expansion 
these criteria are initially evaluated by our field based engineers  accountants  managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits 
however  our policy provides that  based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill  if these criteria are not met  inclusion of unpermitted airspace may still be allowed 
in these circumstances  inclusion must be approved through a landfill specific process that includes approval of our chief financial officer and a review by the audit committee of our board of directors 
when we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of available airspace  we also include the projected costs for final capping  and closure and post closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill 
it is possible that any of our estimates or assumptions could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from actual results 
in some cases we may be unsuccessful in obtaining an expansion permit or we may determine that an expansion permit that we previously thought was probable has become unlikely 
to the extent that such estimates  or the assumptions used to make those estimates  prove to be significantly different than actual results or our belief that we will receive an expansion permit changes adversely in a significant manner  the costs of the landfill  including the costs incurred in the pursuit of the expansion  may be subject to impairment testing  as described below  and lower prospective profitability may be experienced due to increased interest accretion and depreciation or asset impairments related to the removal of previously included expansion airspace 
testing assets for impairment 
testing assets for impairment requires projecting current earnings and cash flows into future periods based on expected trends 
in addition  testing assets for impairment requires that judgments be made regarding reporting units and asset groupings 
starting in  goodwill was tested for impairment based on estimated future discounted cash flows 
other assets are tested for impairment based on estimated undiscounted cash flows 
estimating future cash flows requires making projections that can differ materially from actual results 
environmental liabilities 
as more fully discussed under item  business  our waste management facilities are continuously regulated by federal  state  provincial and local laws enacted to regulate discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise protect the environment 
in addition  in connection with our acquisition of the assets of the csd in september  we agreed to assume certain environmental liabilities of the csd as part of the purchase price for the csd assets 
remedial liabilities are inherently difficult to estimate 
estimating remedial liabilities requires that the existing environmental contamination be understood 
there is a risk that the actual quantities of contaminates differ from the results of the site investigation  and there is a risk that contaminants exist that have not been identified by the site investigation 
in addition  the amount of remedial liabilities recorded is dependent on the remedial method selected 
there is a risk that funds will be expended on a remedial solution that is not successful  which could result in the additional incremental costs of an alternative solution 
such estimates  which are subject to change  are subsequently revised if and when additional information becomes available 
in addition  we must estimate the timing of payments for environmental liabilities years into the future 
because most of the our environmental liabilities are discounted to reflect the respective dates on which we expect to make environmental expenditures  significant acceleration in the timing of payments could result in material charges to earnings 
insurance expense 
it is our policy to retain a significant portion of certain expected losses related primarily to workers compensation  health insurance  comprehensive general and vehicle liability 
accruals are established for incurred losses based on information that is known at the time 
recording health insurance expense requires that estimates be made of the cost of health benefits to be provided in future periods 
actual expenditures required in future periods can differ materially from accruals established based on estimates 
as described in item  selected financial data  we have restated our financial statements for the years ended december  and  and financial information for the years ended december   and  in order to correct errors relating to the methodology we had established for estimating our workers compensation and motor vehicle liability claims 
legal matters 
as described in item  legal proceedings  we are subject to legal proceedings which relate to the acquisition of the csd assets or which have arisen in the ordinary course of business 
accruals are established for legal matters when  in our opinion  it is probable that a liability exists and the liability can be reasonably estimated 
as of december   we had reserves of million substantially all of which we had established as part of the purchase price for the csd assets relating to our potential liabilities in connection with such legal proceedings which were then pending 
estimates of the cost to settle disputes are adjusted as facts emerge 
actual expenses incurred in future periods can differ materially from accruals established 
provision for income taxes 
we are required to estimate the provision for income taxes  including the current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of assets and liabilities for tax and financial accounting purposes 
these differences together with net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits are recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities on the balance sheet 
an assessment must then be made of the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent that we determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred asset will not be utilized  a valuation allowance is established 
taxable income in future periods significantly above or below that now projected will cause adjustments to the valuation allowance that could materially decrease or increase future income tax expense 
we attempt to make realistic estimates in providing allowances for assets and recording liabilities 
because estimates are made in good faith  our experience has been that overestimates in one area are often offset by underestimates in other areas 
we believe that in the future it is probable that an unexpected event such as the sudden bankruptcy of a significant customer or supplier that was previously believed to be a large and stable company could materially affect the results of operations of a future period  however  due to our risk management programs  we believe that such an event would not be material to our financial condition 
results of operations our operations are managed as two segments technical services and site services 
technical services include treatment and disposal of industrial wastes via incineration  landfill or wastewater treatment  collection and transporting of all containerized and bulk waste  categorization  specialized repackaging  treatment and disposal of laboratory chemicals and household hazardous wastes  which are referred to as cleanpack services  and apollo onsite services  which customize environmental programs at customer sites 
this is accomplished through a network of service centers where a fleet of trucks  rail or other transport is dispatched to pick up customers waste either on a pre determined schedule or on demand  and then to deliver waste to a permitted facility 
from the service centers  chemists can also be dispatched to a customer location for the collection of chemical waste for disposal 
site services provide highly skilled experts utilizing specialty equipment and resources to perform services  such as industrial maintenance  surface remediation  groundwater restoration  site and facility decontamination  emergency response  site remediation  pcb disposal and oil disposal at the customer s site or another location 
these services are dispatched on a scheduled or emergency basis 
we also offer outsourcing services for customer environmental management programs and provide analytical testing services  information management and personnel training services 
the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain operating data associated with our results of operations
