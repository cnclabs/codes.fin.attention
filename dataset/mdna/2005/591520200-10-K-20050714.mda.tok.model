item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary statement certain statements in this report are forward looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties 
our business is highly dependent upon three large automotive customers and specific makes and models of automobiles 
therefore  our financial results will be subject to many of the same risks that apply to the automotive industry  such as general economic conditions  interest rates and consumer spending patterns 
a significant portion of the balance of our business relates to the computer and telecommunication industries which are subject to many of the same risks facing the automotive industry as well as fast moving technological change 
other factors which may result in materially different results for future periods include actual performance in our various markets  operating costs  currency exchange rates and devaluations  delays in development  production and marketing of new products  and other factors set forth from time to time in our reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
any of these factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements in this report are intended to be subject to the safe harbor protection provided under the securities laws 
overview we are a global manufacturer of component and subsystem devices with manufacturing  design and testing facilities in the united states  malta  mexico  united kingdom  germany  czech republic  and china 
we design  manufacture and market devices employing electrical  electronic  wireless  sensing and optical technologies 
our business is managed on a technology product basis  with those technology segments being electronic  optical and other 
the business units whose results are identified in the electronic segment principally employ electronic processes to control and convey signals 
the business units whose results are identified in the optical segment principally employ light to control and convey signals 
the other segment includes manufacturers of current carrying bus devices and high current flexible cabling systems  and independent laboratories that provide services for qualification testing and failure analysis 
our components are found in the primary end markets of the automotive  communications including information processing and storage  networking equipment  wireless and terrestrial voice data systems  aerospace  rail and other transportation industries  and the consumer and industrial equipment markets 
recent trends in the industries that we serve include increasing pressure by automobile manufacturers on automotive suppliers to reduce selling prices  growth of north american subsidiaries of foreign based automobile manufacturers  more automotive supplier funded design  engineering and tooling costs previously funded directly by the automobile manufacturers  continued customer migration to low cost eastern european and asian suppliers  and reduced production schedules for domestic automobile manufacturers 
in response to pricing pressures  we continue to transition to lean manufacturing processes and invest in  and implement techniques such as flexible automated manufacturing cells to lower our costs to maintain or improve margins 
we also have become more selective with regard to programs in which we participate in order to reduce our exposure to low profit programs 
our transition to lean manufacturing has helped us obtain our first contract to supply components to a north american plant of a major japanese automobile manufacturer  expected to launch in fiscal in an effort to better compete with low cost manufacturers and expand our business in the asian marketplace  we transferred production from our singapore facility to our shanghai  china plant in fiscal in march  we acquired the assets of cableco technologies corporation cableco  a designer and manufacturer of high current  flexible cabling systems for electronic and electrical applications 
the acquisition enhances our existing power distribution business  network bus products  by bringing a complimentary product portfolio and diverse customer base within the computer  telecommunication  medical and military markets and will 
table of contents enable us to provide a more complete product offering to our customers 
we plan to shift the majority of cableco s manufacturing operations to our facility in reynosa  mexico 
cableco s trailing twelve months revenues were approximately million 
business outlook sales in fiscal are expected to increase modestly compared to fiscal sales of sensor pads for passive occupant detection systems are expected to increase  as automakers are required to meet the federal requirement to provide passive occupant detection for front passenger airbag deployment on all vehicles for the model year and beyond 
we anticipate continued growth in power distribution products with additional increases coming from asia as well as the joint marketing capability gained from the cableco acquisition 
these increases will be significantly offset by negotiated price reductions and forecasted lower sales from methode s traditional north american automotive oems along with the company s continued transition away from less profitable programs 
additional expenses are anticipated as we establish power distribution manufacturing in shanghai  china 
in fiscal  methode will incur increased expense for the amortization of stock based compensation awards

the net effect of the increase in customer paid tooling  and foreign currency translation increased our net sales to the automotive industry by 
the balance of the increase is primarily due to strong sales growth of sensor pads for passenger occupancy detection systems pods as 
table of contents automakers ramp up to meet increasing federal safety requirements  and increased automotive switch sales in europe 
net sales of other products to north american automotive customers declined  the result of price reductions given to automakers on legacy products and lower vehicle build in fiscal net sales for the balance of the electronic segment were relatively flat compared to last year 
we had strong sales of our copper transceiver  which enables high speed gigabit data transfers over existing copper infrastructure  but the balance of the non automotive business units in the electronic segment experienced sales declines or only modest sales gains in fiscal  largely due to competitive pressures from low cost eastern european and asian manufacturers 
the closing of our manufacturing operation in ireland in the third quarter of fiscal also had a negative impact on year over year net sales comparisons see note to the consolidated financial statements 
optical segment net sales represented of consolidated net sales for fiscal compared to in fiscal net sales of the optical segment in fiscal  which reflect a million increase in sales due to the effects of foreign currency translation  increased to million compared to million in fiscal net sales at our domestic subsidiary that provides custom installation of fiber optic cable assemblies primarily to data centers increased for the year to million 
the sales increase at this business unit was attributable to general market improvement 
lost sales due to the closing of our fiber optic operation in the united kingdom at the end of fiscal were largely offset by sales of million related to a one time project by our czech republic operation 
other segment net sales represented of consolidated net sales in fiscal compared with last year 
net sales of the other segment increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the sales increase in this segment is due to new bus bar product shipments and an expanded customer base for these products 
net sales of cableco  which we acquired in march  contributed of the sales increase for the segment see note to the consolidated financial statements 
sales declines experienced by our test laboratories in more than offset the additional sales from the cableco acquisition 
other income 
other income consisted primarily of earnings from our automotive joint venture  license fees  royalties  and engineering design fees 
the decrease in other income was primarily due to a decrease in design fees earned in fiscal earnings from our automotive joint venture are also declining as the operation winds down towards its scheduled end of life in fiscal cost of products sold 
cost of products sold  as a percentage of net sales  was in fiscal compared with in fiscal the impact of customer paid tooling sales  which are intended to reimburse the company for the cost of customer owned tooling used by the company to manufacture product for the customer  increased the cost of sales percentage by in both fiscal and gross margins on product sales of the electronic segment increased to in fiscal from in fiscal strong sales gains of pods sensor pads  automotive switch sales in europe and our copper transceivers contributed to the margin gain during fiscal benefits from our lean manufacturing initiatives helped to reduce the negative margin impact of production volume declines and price reductions on sales to our traditional north american automotive customers in fiscal fiscal gross margins were unfavorably impacted by a disruption in production at our scotland automotive plant due to a fire  and costs due to challenges launching several new products that increased that facility s sales by in fiscal the closing of the cable assembly operation in ireland resulted in a million charge to cost of sales in and reduced the gross margin by percentage points 
gross margins of the optical segment increased to in fiscal from in fiscal in fiscal  our domestic subsidiary that provides custom installation of fiber optic cable assemblies began outsourcing the manufacturing of cable assemblies 
this outsourcing coupled with a increase in sales contributed significantly to the margin improvement 
the divestiture of our fiber optic operation in the uk also contributed to the margin improvement 
the uk fiber optic unit s operations and costs associated with the divestiture reduced margins by in fiscal gross margins of the other segment were flat at in fiscal and fiscal margin improvement on sales of power distribution products primarily due to increased sales volumes  was offset by margin declines at our test laboratories and integration costs associated with the acquisition of cableco

expanded sales presence at our fiber optic custom installation business  increased research and development costs and corporate governance initiatives also contributed to the increase in fiscal fiscal included million of expenses  primarily legal  financial advisory and other fees related to the elimination of the company s dual class common stock structure and the unsolicited tender offer for its class b shares 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles relates to intangible assets acquired by the company in connection with various business acquisitions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income  net 
interest income  net of interest expense  increased in fiscal compared with fiscal due to higher average investment balances and higher interest rates 
other  net 
in fiscal  other  net included million of income from life insurance proceeds from policies owned by the company in connection with an employee deferred compensation plan 
the balance of other  net consists primarily of currency exchange gains and losses at our foreign subsidiaries 
the functional currencies of these subsidiaries are the maltese lira  euro  singapore dollar  british pound  chinese yuan and czech koruna 
the foreign subsidiaries have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies  primarily sales in us dollars  creating exchange rate sensitivities 
currency exchange losses of million and million were experienced by the company s foreign subsidiaries in fiscal and  respectively  as the result of a weak us dollar 
income taxes 
the effective income tax rate in fiscal was compared with in fiscal the effective rate increased in primarily due to the change in mix of domestic and foreign taxable income and losses incurred in the uk and china for which no tax benefit could be recognized 
the effective rate in included a reduction for the tax exempt income from life insurance and the effective rates in both years reflect utilization of foreign investment tax credits and the effect of lower tax rates on income at our foreign operations

the net effect of the decline in customer paid tooling and foreign currency translation reduced automotive industry net sales by 
strong sales growth of pods seat sensors and increased automotive switch sales in europe were offset by the decline in unit sales experienced by our traditional north american automotive customers in fiscal the net decline in product sales to north american automotive customers in fiscal reflects both price reductions and reduced unit sales due to lost market share by these customers 
sales for the balance of the electronic segment in fiscal were down compared to last year  reflecting the continued weakness in the telecommunication market and increased competition from low cost eastern european and asian manufacturers 
price erosion and lost sales to lower cost eastern european and asian suppliers led to our decision to close our ireland copper cable assembly business in fiscal resulting in a million charge to earnings see note to the consolidated financial statements 
optical segment net sales represented of consolidated net sales for both fiscal years and net sales of the optical segment in fiscal  which reflect a million increase in sales due to the effects of foreign currency translation  remained flat at million compared to million in fiscal net sales at our domestic subsidiary that provides custom installation of fiber optic cable assemblies primarily to data centers  
table of contents increased for the year to million 
the sales increase at this business unit was attributable to general market improvement and the addition of a substantial new customer 
net sales for our united kingdom optical cable assembly operation fell more than in fiscal due to the continued weakness in the telecommunication market  price erosion and lost sales to lower cost eastern european and asian suppliers 
we determined that the united kingdom unit could not compete in this environment and at the end of fiscal  we closed this operation  transferring some production to our czech republic fiber optic facility and executing an agreement to sell the balance to local management for cash of million  resulting in a net charge to earnings of million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
other segment net sales represented of consolidated net sales in fiscal compared with last year 
net sales of the other segment increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the sales increase in this segment is primarily due to new power distribution product offerings and an expanded customer base for those products 
other income 
other income consisted primarily of earnings from our automotive joint venture  license fees  royalties  and in fiscal  engineering design fees 
the increase in other income was primarily due to the design fees earned in fiscal other income in fiscal was reduced because the automotive joint venture experienced lower income due to quality issues 
cost of products sold 
cost of products sold  as a percentage of net sales  was in fiscal compared with in fiscal gross margins on product sales of the electronic segment decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decline in gross margins was primarily due to the decline in unit sales experienced by the company s traditional north american automotive customers  price reductions given to these automotive customers that were not completely recovered by cost cutting programs  and increased costs for employee medical in fiscal our automotive facility in scotland also contributed to the decline in margins as it experienced a disruption in production due to a fire  and additional costs due to challenges launching several new products that increased its sales by in fiscal the closing of the cable assembly operation in ireland resulted in a million charge to cost of sales in and reduced the gross margin by percentage points 
margins improved in the fourth quarter of fiscal as our transition to lean manufacturing helped reduce our manufacturing costs in north america and our product mix improved 
gross margins of the optical segment decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decline in margins was due to a million charge to cost of sales for the divestiture of our fiber optic operation in the uk and higher costs for inventory obsolescence at our fiber optic cable custom installation operation 
gross margins of the other segment increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the margin improvement was primarily the result of the increased sales volume of power distribution products and our testing services  with lower incremental fixed costs

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial position and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  however  we do not believe that it is reasonably likely that changes will occur 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue on product sales when i persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  ii the price is fixed or determinable  iii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  and iv collection of the sales proceeds is reasonably assured 
revenue from the company s product sales not requiring installation  net of trade discounts and estimated sales allowances  is recognized when title passes  which is upon shipment 
the company does not have any additional obligations or customer acceptance provisions after shipment of such products 
the company handles returns by replacing  repairing or issuing credit for defective products when returned 
revenue from cabling infrastructure systems installations is recognized when the installation is completed  tested and accepted by the customer 
revenue from customer tooling sales is recognized when the tooling is completed  producing production parts to specification  and accepted by the customer 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
the amount of the allowance is based on the age of unpaid amounts  information about the creditworthiness of customers  and other relevant information 
estimates of uncollectible amounts are revised each period  and changes are recorded in the period they become known 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
in addition  our revenues and accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers or a deterioration in the economic environment or automotive industry  in general  could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results  including a reduction in future revenues and additional allowances for doubtful accounts 
allowance for excess and obsolete inventory 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value and have been reduced by allowances for excess and obsolete inventories 
the estimated allowances are based on management s review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales  using assumptions about future product life cycles  product demand and market conditions 
if actual product life cycles  product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
intangible assets 
we have significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether these assets are impaired involves significant judgment 
in assessing the recoverability of our intangibles  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on may  the company ceased amortizing goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an annual impairment review see note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
the process involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing tax 
table of contents planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
the tax laws of malta provide for investment tax credits of of certain qualified expenditures 
unused credits can be carried forward indefinitely 
we have accumulated investment tax credits in excess of amounts more likely than not to be realized based upon projections of taxable income to be generated within a reasonable time period 
valuation allowances have been provided for this excess 
contingencies 
the company is subject to various investigations  claims  legal and administrative proceedings covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of business activities 
a significant amount of judgment and use of estimates is required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters 
for those matters that management can estimate a range of loss  we have established reserves at levels within that range to provide for the most likely scenario based upon available information 
the valuation of reserves for contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assure that the company is properly reserved 
reserve balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional reserves for emerging issues 
while we believe that the current level of reserves is adequate  changes in the future could impact these determinations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk certain of our foreign subsidiaries enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency  primarily the us dollar and the euro 
a change in foreign currency exchange rates from balance sheet date levels could impact our income before income taxes by million and million at april  and april   respectively 
we also have foreign currency exposure arising from the translation of our net equity investment in our foreign subsidiaries to us dollars 
we generally view as long term our investments in foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us dollar 
the primary currencies to which we are exposed are the british pound  chinese yuan  czech koruna  euro  maltese lira  and singapore dollar 
a change in foreign currency exchange rates from balance sheet date levels could impact our net foreign investments by million and million at april  and april   respectively
