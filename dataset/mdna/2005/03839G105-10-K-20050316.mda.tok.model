overview we are a digital marketing services and technology company that helps marketers acquire  retain and grow customers across digital media 
we are organized into three lines of business digital marketing services  digital marketing technologies  and  digital performance media 
reclassifications beginning in  we moved revenue associated with a technology product for publishers  which was developed and managed by avenue a razorfish and had been included in digital marketing services results in the past  to the digital marketing technologies segment 
the results for and have been adjusted to reflect this change and to provide consistency with the presentation 
in addition  beginning in  we are now reporting all revenues derived from selling proprietary ad serving technologies through our digital marketing services line of business as part of revenue of atlas and the digital marketing technologies line of business 
the results for and have also been adjusted to reflect this change and provide consistency with the presentation 
acquisitions and comparability of operations our results of operations for the year ended december  include the results of several acquisitions including netconversions in february  mediabrokers  technologybrokers and sbi 
razorfish in july the results of these acquisitions must be factored into any comparison of our results to the results for or see note of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  for pro forma financial information as if these entities had been acquired on january  and digital marketing services effective january   avenue a razorfish s clients are directly liable for the cost of media purchases pursuant to those contractual agreements 
as a result  we began recording revenue generated under such contractual agreements on a net basis  which excludes the cost of media purchased for our clients 
in july  we completed the acquisition of interactive advertising agency  sbi 
razorfish  an internet marketing and consulting firm 
combined with interactive agency avenue a  the resulting brand identity for the company s agency business is now avenue a razorfish 
avenue avenue a razorfish offers advertisers a suite of digital marketing services to help clients use the internet as an integrated online business channel

table of contents due to the contributions made as a result of the acquisition of sbi 
razorfish  new media and search clients  increased spending from existing clients  and the impact of these and other industry trends  our digital marketing services line of business experienced significant growth during the year ended december  resulting in revenues of million  compared to million in net revenue  which management believes is a non gaap financial measure  and which excludes the cost of media purchased for our clients  during the years ended december  see results of operations below for a reconciliation of revenue and cost of revenue as reported to net revenue and cost of revenue 
contributions to revenue made as a result of the acquisition of sbi 
razorfish were million while the existing media and search business of avenue a contributed million to revenue during the year ended december  this represents a increase in revenue from our existing media and search business during the year ended december  with the acquisition of sbi 
razorfish  our web development business accounts for the majority of the clients added during the year ended december   however the media and search portion of the business also experienced growth in customer base 
as the integration of sbi 
razorfish progresses  we expect to see cross selling between the media  search and web development customer bases in the long term 
the digital marketing services line of business experienced a decrease in income from operations as a percentage of revenue  to million of income from operations  or of revenue  during the year ended december  compared to million  or of net revenue  during the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to the lower operating margins generated by the web development portion of this business since the acquisition of sbi 
razorfish in july for the web development business  both the addition of new clients and increased spending from existing clients requires a proportionately greater increase in client support expense in order to fulfill the client contracts than our media and search business 
whereas  in general  for our media and search business  increased spending from existing clients requires only modest increases in client support costs  while the addition of new clients results in a more significant increase in client support costs 
as such  we expect the margins generated by the web development portion of this business to be relatively lower than those of our existing media and search business 
however  we have implemented long term initiatives to improve the margins and profitability of the web development portion of this line of business and anticipate the income from operations to increase as a percentage of revenue near the level of industry standards of approximately in the future

critical accounting policies and judgments the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents revenue recognition for fixed price contracts avenue a razorfish follows sop accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts and recognizes revenue from fixed fee consulting contracts as services are rendered using the percentage of completion method with progress to complete measured using labor hour inputs and milestone outputs  as applicable 
cost estimates on percentage of completion contracts are reviewed periodically with adjustments recorded in the period in which the revisions are made 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as they are determinable 
billings on uncompleted contracts may be less than or greater than the revenues recognized and are recorded as either unbilled receivable an asset or deferred revenue a liability in the consolidated financial statements 
the complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting affect the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including labor rates  utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes 
revenue for all types of contracts is deferred in cases where we have not yet earned revenue but have billed the customer or received payment from the customer prior to providing the services 
revenue is recognized only when collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue also includes any reimbursements received from our clients related to expenses incurred by our employees in servicing our clients 
such expenses include airfare  mileage  meals and hotel stays 
accounting for acquisitions significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of purchased assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition  including estimating future cash flows from the acquired business  determining appropriate discount rates  asset lives and other assumptions 
our process to determine the fair value of the non compete agreements  customer relationships  developed technology and consulting service model includes the use of estimates including the potential impact on operating results if the non compete agreements were not in place  revenue estimates for customers acquired through the acquisition based on an assumed customer attrition rate  estimated costs willing to be incurred to purchase the capabilities gained through the developed technology and consulting service model  and appropriate discount rates based on the particular business s weighted average cost of capital 
our estimates of an entity s growth and costs are based on historical data  various internal estimates and a variety of external sources  and are developed as part of our routine long range planning process 
accounting for goodwill goodwill is initially recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we perform an annual review in the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist at the reporting unit level  to determine if the recorded goodwill is impaired 
a reporting unit level is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
this determination requires significant judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value  including the goodwill related to the reporting unit 
to determine the fair value  our review process uses the income method and is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses estimates including the following for the reporting units revenue based on assumed market segment growth rates  estimated costs  and appropriate discount rates based on the particular business s weighted average cost of capital 
our estimates of market segment growth and costs are based on historical data  various internal estimates and a variety of external sources 
in addition to being used in our goodwill impairment analysis  the same estimates are used in the planning for both our long term and short term business planning and forecasting 
we test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis by comparison to available and comparable market data 
changes in these 
table of contents estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment of each reporting unit 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed our most recent review which did not result in the recording of an impairment charge 
we will perform our next annual review during the fourth quarter of we may incur charges for the impairment of goodwill in the future if a reporting unit fails to achieve our assumed revenue growth rates or assumed operating margin results 
accounting for income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
the company performs periodic evaluations of recorded tax assets and liabilities and maintains a valuation allowance if deemed necessary 
the determination of taxes payable for the current year includes estimates 
in the event that actual results differ materially from management s expectations  the estimated taxes payable could materially change  directly impacting the company s financial position or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions related to financial statements the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those affecting revenues  the allowance for doubtful accounts  allowance for sales credits  intangible assets  goodwill  state  local and federal income taxes and general business contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
washington state tax authorities issued a ruling in that permits us to exclude amounts paid by us to purchase media for clients that is ultimately billed to and paid for by clients  from the measure of washington state business and occupation tax

the period under audit is january  through september  the audit has not been completed

net cash from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was  and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
our net cash provided by operating activities is primarily a 
table of contents result of our net income loss adjusted by non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization and changes in working capital components  which are influenced by the timing of cash collections from our clients and cash payments for purchases of media and other expenses 
the changes in working capital are significantly influenced by the increases in accounts receivable due to both the organic growth in the business and the new growth resulting from the recent acquisitions 
due to this growth  we have experienced changes in the composition of our accounts receivables and this change has increased the timing of cash collections from our clients 
the growth in the business is also contributing to the increases in amounts owed for media and other purchases 
in addition to the effect of organic growth and growth from recent acquisitions on working capital  we believe that beginning in  the change in the contractual terms with our clients influenced our cash flow from operating activities 
the timing of payments for media purchases is now directly influenced by the timing of payment received from our clients for such media purchases 
under our prior avenue a razorfish contract structure in  we were liable for media purchases for our clients and the payment of publisher invoices was not dependent on receipt of payment from our clients 
as such  during the year ended december   the cash generated from operating activities was influenced by the timing of payments received from clients
