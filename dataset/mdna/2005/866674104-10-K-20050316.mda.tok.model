item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto elsewhere herein 
the company is a fully integrated  self administered and self managed reit which owns  operates  develops and finances manufactured housing communities concentrated in the midwestern and southeastern united states 
as of december   the company owned and operated a portfolio of developed properties located in eighteen states  including manufactured housing communities  five recreational vehicle communities  and seven properties containing both manufactured housing and recreational vehicle sites 
the company completed a significant restructuring of its capital and operating debt during secured debt financings of million with average terms approximating years and weighted average interest rates of approximately were concluded  as well as the successful negotiation of a new million revolving line of credit at libor 
proceeds from the secured financings were used to retire existing debt  acquire communities  and repurchase the company s stock 
the company has also provided the required notice to retire million of ppop units during the first quarter of and is authorized to repurchase up to million additional shares of its stock 
during the company acquired nine manufactured housing communities comprising approximately developed and undeveloped sites 
the aggregate purchase price was million and included the assumption of approximately million in debt 
three of the communities are in northeast atlanta  four are located in michigan and the remaining properties are located in colorado and texas 
in recent years the operations of manufactured homebuilders  dealers  and the companies that finance the purchase of the homes have experienced severe losses and substantial volatility 
new home shipments have declined from approximately  in to approximately  in the decline was largely due to the turmoil in the financing side of the industry as lenders experienced substantial losses arising from defaults on poorly underwritten loans in the mid to late s and beyond 
as a result of the losses  the lenders experienced liquidity constraints and significantly tightened underwriting standards thus reducing the demand for new homes 
these trends appear to be abating as several large home manufacturers are reporting operating income and the volume of repossessed homes in the market place appears to be declining 
newly repossessed homes are also declining as the reinforcing effects of tightened underwriting standards and reduced new home financing volumes impact the industry 
the effect of these trends on the company has been to reduce occupancies in our portfolio as the demand of tenants for sites in our communities has declined for the above stated reasons 
the rate of leasing in our new community developments has likewise slowed 
despite these trends  the company s same property portfolio has consistently reflected growth in net operating income evidencing the revenue and operating stability long associated with the business of owning and operating manufactured housing communities 
while the problems which directly impacted the manufacturers  dealers  and lenders appear to be bottoming  the company does not expect a rapid or strong recovery in its operations 
the company expects a gradually improving leasing environment in its portfolio 
as a result of these industry conditions  a large quantity of homes repossessed by lenders have become available for purchase at discounts of up to and more from original cost or loan amount 
the company has made every effort to acquire these value priced homes especially as the alternative would likely be the removal of the homes from the community 
such removal would create total dependence on the sale of a new home to fill the site 
as new home shipments have declined by nearly two thirds from their peak in to current levels  such dependence would leave the company vulnerable to a recovery in new home shipments as its primary method to improve occupancy 
the company intends to sell these value priced homes to residents over time 
in the meantime it is most economical to rent the homes 
at december   the company had approximately  homes rented in its communities which comprise over  sites 
all renters are subject to underwriting criteria 
the company expects to continue to acquire homes from lenders as long as the pricing of the homes remains compelling 
the company is actively developing programs for its renters and others to acquire these homes 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgment of certain amounts included in the financial statements 
nevertheless  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following significant accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements impairment of long lived assets 
rental property is recorded at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
the company measures the recoverability of its assets in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
if such assets were deemed to be impaired as a result of this measurement  the impairment that would be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset as determined on a discounted net cash flow basis 
assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
circumstances that may prompt a test of recoverability may include a significant decrease in anticipated market price  an adverse change to the extent or manner in which an asset may be used or in its physical condition or other such events that may significantly change the value of the long lived asset 
notes receivable 
the company evaluates the recoverability of its notes receivable whenever events occur or there are changes in circumstances such that management believes it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the loan is then measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flow discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
depreciation 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
useful lives are years for land improvements and buildings and to years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
revenue recognition 
rental income attributable to leases is recorded on a straight line basis when earned from tenants 
leases entered into by tenants generally range from month to month to one year and are renewable by mutual agreement of the company and the resident or  in some cases  as provided by state statute 
revenue from the sale of manufactured homes is recognized upon transfer of title at the closing of the sales transaction 
the company offers  through its home buying made easy program  retail installment contracts at interest rates of to percent to qualified buyers of homes within its communities 
the company amortizes the interest discount from current market rates related to this program into income over the term of the note 
the company also bifurcates the discounted present value of the interest differential between the home sale and the anticipated rental revenue as required by emerging issues task force revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the differential allocated to the home sale is recognized as a reduction of revenue from the sale of the home and the differential allocated to future rental revenue is amortized as rental discount over the term of the loan 
capitalized costs 
the company capitalizes certain costs including interest and other costs incurred in connection with the development  redevelopment  capital enhancement and leasing of its properties 
management is required to use professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization 
the amounts are dependent on the volume and timing of such activities and the costs associated with such activities 
maintenance  repairs and minor improvements to properties are expensed when incurred 
renovations and improvements to properties are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and construction costs related to the development of new community or expansion sites are capitalized until the property is substantially complete 
certain expenditures to dealers and residents related to obtaining lessees in our communities are capitalized and amortized over a seven year period 
costs associated with implementing the company s computer systems are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the related software and hardware 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the company has entered into three interest rate swap agreements to offset interest rate risk 
the company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
the company adjusts its balance sheet on an ongoing quarterly basis to reflect current fair market value of its derivatives 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in earnings or comprehensive income  as appropriate 
the ineffective portion of the hedge is immediately recognized in earnings to the extent that the change in value of a derivative does not perfectly offset the change in value of the instrument being hedged 
the unrealized gains and losses held in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to earnings over time and occurs when the hedged items are also recognized in earnings 
the company uses standard market conventions to determine the fair values of derivative instruments  including the quoted market prices or quotes from brokers or dealers for the same or similar instruments 
all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value and such value may never actually be realized 
income taxes 
the company has elected to be taxed as a reit as defined under section c of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
in order for the company to qualify as a reit  at least ninety five percent of the company s gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources 
as a reit  the company generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level if it distributes at least ninety percent of its reit ordinary taxable income to its stockholders  which it fully intends to do 
if the company fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  the company will be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates 
the company remains subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property as well as federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed income

these increases were partially offset by million of income related primarily to the change in market value of an interest rate swap contract that does not qualify for hedge accounting 
the million impairment charge relates to a reduction in the book value of a new community development due to the impracticality of future phase construction 
equity income from affiliates of million represents the company s one third interest in the operations of origen for its initial operating period after a recapitalization in october  the remaining expense increase of million relates to the consolidation of sun home services which is discussed in detail below 
sun home services prior to january   the results of operations of sun home services were accounted for using the equity method and reported as a single line item called equity in income from affiliates 
as the company is the primary beneficiary of the results of operations of sun home services  it is appropriate to consolidate sun home services at december  this has no effect on previously reported net income 
in the table below  the year is presented as if shs was consolidated proforma as of december  for comparative purposes 
the following table summarizes certain financial and statistical data for sun home services for the years ended december  and increase decrease percent change pro forma new home sales revenues    cost of sales    gross profit    pre owned home sales revenues    cost of sales    gross profit  ancillary revenue  net   home sales volumes new homes pre owned homes new home sales declined by percent  while revenues and costs of sales declined by and percent  respectively

pre owned home unit sales increased by percent while revenues and cost of sales increased by percent and percent  respectively 
gross profit increased by percent as revenues grew more than cost of sales due to strong demand for the value in pre owned homes 
the increase in ancillary revenue  net  is primarily due to increased activity in the company s rental home program 
same property information the following table reflects property level financial information as of and for the years ended december  and the same property data represents information regarding the operation of communities owned as of january  and december  site  occupancy  and rent data for those communities is presented as of the last day of each period presented 
the total portfolio column differentiates from the same property column by including financial information for properties acquired after january  and new development communities 
same property total portfolio in thousands in thousands income from rental property     property operating expenses property operating and maintenance     real estate taxes     property operating expenses     property net operating income     number of properties developed sites     occupied sites     occupancy weighted average monthly rent per site sites available for development     sites planned for development in next year investors in and analysts following the real estate industry utilize net operating income noi as a supplemental performance measure 
noi is derived from revenues determined in accordance with gaap minus property operating expenses and real estate taxes determined in accordance with gaap 
noi does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered to be an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of the company s financial performance or to be an alternative to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available for the company s cash needs  including its ability to make cash distributions 
the company believes that net income is the most directly comparable gaap measurement to net operating income 
net income includes interest and depreciation and amortization which often have no effect on the market value of a property and therefore limit its use as a performance measure 
in addition  such expenses are often incurred at a parent company level and therefore are not necessarily linked to the performance of a real estate asset 
the company believes that net operating income is helpful to investors as a measure of operating performance because it is an indicator of the return on property investment  and provides a method of comparing property performance over time 
the company uses noi as a key management tool when evaluating performance and growth of particular properties and or groups of properties 
the principal limitation of noi is that it excludes depreciation  amortization and non property specific expenses such as general and administrative expenses  all of which are significant costs  and therefore  noi is a measure of the operating performance of the properties of the company rather than of the company overall 
occupancy and weighted average rent relates to manufactured housing sites  excluding recreational vehicle sites 
on a same property basis  property net operating income increased by million from million to million  or percent 
income from property increased by million from million to million  or percent  due primarily to increases in rents including water and property tax pass through 
property operating expenses increased by million from million to million  or percent  due to increases in real estate taxes million  utilities and other million 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal liquidity demands have historically been  and are expected to continue to be  distributions to the company s stockholders and the unitholders of the operating partnership  property acquisitions  development and expansion of properties  capital improvements of properties  the purchase of new and pre owned homes and debt repayment 
the company expects to meet its short term liquidity requirements through its working capital provided by operating activities and through its million line of credit 
the company considers these resources to be adequate to meet all operating requirements  including recurring capital improvements  routinely amortizing debt and other normally recurring expenditures of a capital nature  pay dividends to its stockholders to maintain qualification as a reit in accordance with the internal revenue code and make distributions to the operating partnership s unitholders 
the company plans to invest approximately to million in developments consisting of expansions to existing communities and the development of new communities during the company expects to finance these investments by using net cash flows provided by operating activities and by drawing upon its line of credit 
furthermore  the company may invest substantial amounts in the acquisition of properties during  depending upon a number of factors  including the availability of high quality properties that meet the company s criteria for acquisition 
the company will finance these investments using the proceeds from its secured financing transactions  the temporary use of its line of credit until permanent secured financing can be arranged and through the assumption of existing debt on the properties 
cash and cash equivalents increased by million to million at december  compared to million at december  net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the company s net cash flows provided by operating activities may be adversely impacted by  among other things a the market and economic conditions in the company s markets  b lower occupancy rates of the properties  c increased operating costs  including insurance premiums  real estate taxes and utilities  that cannot be passed on to the company s tenants  and d decreased sales or rentals of manufactured homes 
see factors that may affect future results 
as previously discussed  the company completed a significant restructuring of its capital and operating debt during the company securitized an additional of its properties providing significant proceeds for the repayment of existing higher rate debt  property acquisitions and stock repurchases 
during the company acquired nine manufactured housing communities with an aggregate purchase price of million 
the properties were purchased with cash provided from secured financing transactions and the assumption of approximately million in debt 
the company has a million unsecured line of credit facility  which bears interest at libor and matures in september  with a one year optional extension 
at december   million of availability was used to back standby letters of credit and million was available to be drawn under the facility 
the line of credit facility contains various leverage  debt service coverage  net worth maintenance and other customary covenants all of which the company was in compliance with at december  the company s primary long term liquidity needs are principal payments on outstanding indebtedness 
at december   the company s outstanding contractual obligations were as follows payments due by period in thousands contractual cash obligations total due year years years after years collateralized term loan   collateralized term loan fnma      collateralized term loan b of a     senior notes   mortgage notes  other      redeemable preferred op units    interest expense is a material cash requirement of the company 
the company s projected interest expense is million  million  million  million  and million for the years     and  respectively 
the company anticipates meeting its long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled debt maturities  large property acquisitions  and operating partnership unit redemptions through the collateralization of a significant portion of its properties 
from time to time  the company may also issue shares of its capital stock  issue equity units in the operating partnership or sell selected assets 
the ability of the company to finance its long term liquidity requirements in such manner will be affected by numerous economic factors affecting the manufactured housing community industry at the time  including the availability and cost of mortgage debt  the financial condition of the company  the operating history of the properties  the state of the debt and equity markets  and the general national  regional and local economic conditions 
see factors that may affect future results 
if the company is unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition will be adversely impacted 
at december   the company s debt to total market capitalization approximated percent assuming conversion of all common op units to shares of common stock 
the debt has a weighted average maturity of approximately years and a weighted average interest rate of percent 
capital expenditures for the years ended december  and included recurring capital expenditures of million excluding million related to a software conversion and million excluding million related to a main office relocation and million related to software conversion  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million in the prior year 
the difference is due to increased investment in rental properties of million  increased short term investments of million  decreased proceeds from property and land disposition of million  decreased repayments of notes receivables and officer s notes  net of million  offset by a reduction in investment in and advances to affiliate of million  and increased net proceeds from loans sold to and purchased from origen of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million in the prior year 
the difference is primarily due to changes in net proceeds from notes payable and other debt  inclusive of repayments on line of credit  of million  offset by increased distributions of million  changes in net proceeds from common stock issuance of million  increased payments of deferred financing costs of million  and treasury stock purchases of million 
ratio of earnings to fixed charges the company s ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the year ended december  was less than the earnings deficiency required to bring the ratio to is million 
the company s ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
inflation most of the leases allow for periodic rent increases which provide the company with the opportunity to achieve increases in rental income as each lease expires 
such types of leases generally minimize the risk of inflation to the company

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued share based payment statement no 
r  that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
under the fasb s statement  all forms of share based payments to employees  including employee stock options  must be treated the same as other forms of compensation by recognizing the related cost in the income statement 
the expense of the award would generally be measured at fair value at the grant date 
current accounting guidance requires that the expense relating to so called fixed plan employee stock options only be disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements 
the statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees for options granted after june  we will be required to apply sfas no 
r as of the first interim reporting period that begins after june   and we plan to adopt it using the modified prospective method  effective july  the company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its results of operations and financial position 
other funds from operations ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable operating property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo is a non gaap financial measure that management believes is a useful supplemental measure of the company s operating performance 
management generally considers ffo to be a useful measure for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because  by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates  ffo provides a performance measure that  when compared year over year  reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates and operating costs  providing perspective not readily apparent from net income 
management believes that the use of ffo has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and making comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful 
because ffo excludes significant economic components of net income including depreciation and amortization  ffo should be used as an adjunct to net income and not as an alternative to net income 
the principal limitation of ffo is that it does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap and is a supplemental measure of performance that does not replace net income as a measure of performance or net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
in addition  ffo is not intended as a measure of a reit s ability to meet debt principal repayments and other cash requirements  nor as a measure of working capital 
ffo only provides investors with an additional performance measure 
other reits may use different methods for calculating ffo and  accordingly  the company s ffo may not be comparable to other reits 
the following table reconciles net income to ffo and calculates ffo data for both basic and diluted purposes for the years ended december    in thousands sun communities  inc 
reconciliation of net income to fund from operations amounts in thousands  except for per share op unit amounts net income loss    adjustments depreciation and amortization    valuation adjustment allocation of sunchamp losses   gain loss on dispositions  net    income loss allocated to common minority interests    funds from operations ffo    ffo continuing operations    ffo discontinued operations   weighted average common shares op units outstanding basic    diluted    continuing operations ffo per weighted average common share op unit basic ffo per weighted average common share op unit diluted discontinued operations ffo per weighted average common share op unit basic ffo per weighted average common share op unit diluted total operations ffo per weighted average common share op unit basic ffo per weighted average common share op unit diluted the company entered into three interest rate swaps and an interest rate cap agreement 
the valuation adjustment reflects the theoretical noncash profit and loss were those hedging transactions terminated at the balance sheet date 
as the company has no expectation of terminating the transactions prior to maturity  the net of these noncash valuation adjustments will be zero at the various maturities 
as any imperfection related to hedging correlation in these swaps is reflected currently in cash as interest  the valuation adjustments reflect volatility that would distort the comparative measurement of ffo and on a net basis approximate zero 
accordingly  the valuation adjustments are excluded from ffo 
the valuation adjustment is included in interest expense 
the company acquired the equity interest of another investor in sunchamp in december consideration consisted of a long term note payable at net book value 
although the adjustment for the allocation of the sunchamp losses based on sunchamp as a stand alone entity is not reflected in the accompanying financial statements  management believes that it is appropriate to provide for this adjustment because the company s payment obligations with respect to the note are subordinate in all respects to the return of the members equity including the gross book value of the acquired equity plus a preferred return 
as a result  the losses that are allocated to the company from sunchamp as a stand alone entity under generally accepted accounting principles are effectively reallocated to the note for purposes of calculating ffo 
a situation such as this is not contemplated in the nareit definition of ffo due to the unique circumstances of the transaction 
although not comparable to the precise nareit definition  the company believes the inclusion of this item in its calculation of ffo to be appropriate as noted above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s principal market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the company mitigates this risk by maintaining prudent amounts of leverage  minimizing capital costs and interest expense while continuously evaluating all available debt and equity resources and following established risk management policies and procedures  which include the periodic use of derivatives 
the company s primary strategy in entering into derivative contracts is to minimize the variability that changes in interest rates could have on its future cash flows 
the company generally employs derivative instruments that effectively convert a portion of its variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
the company does not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
the company has entered into three separate interest rate swap agreements and an interest rate cap agreement 
one of the swap agreements fixes million of variable rate borrowings at percent for the period april through july  another of the swap agreements fixes million of variable rate borrowings at percent for the period april through july and the third swap agreement  which is only effective for so long as day libor is percent or less  fixes million of variable rate borrowings at percent for the period april through july the interest rate cap agreement has a cap rate of percent  a notional amount of million and a termination date of april  each of the company s derivative contracts is based upon day libor 
the company s remaining variable rate debt totals million as of december  which bears interest at prime  various libor or fnma discounted mortgage backed securities dmbs rates 
if prime  libor  or dmbs increased or decreased by percent during the years ended december  and  the company believes its interest expense would have increased or decreased by approximately million and million  respectively  based on the million and million average balance outstanding under the company s variable rate debt facilities for the year ended december  and  respectively 
additionally  the company had million and million libor based variable rate mortgage and other notes receivable as of december  and if libor increased or decreased by percent during the years ended december  and  the company believes interest income would have increased or decreased by approximately million and million  respectively  based on the million and million average balance outstanding on all variable rate notes receivable for the year ended december  and  respectively
