the total debt to total capital ratio for the company was in and in the company s pension benefit results are based upon actuarial valuations

no provision has been made for us federal and state income taxes or foreign taxes that may result from future remittances of the undistributed earnings million at january  and million at january  of foreign subsidiaries as the company expects such earnings will be reinvested overseas indefinitely 
however  the company is analyzing the potential impact of the repatriation provision of the american jobs creation act of the act  which would allow the company to bring these foreign earnings back to the united states at reduced tax rates effective until december  if elected  the amount of repatriation is not expected to exceed million because a dividend of earnings from certain jurisdictions would not result in a tax benefit where foreign statutory rates exceed the us rate 
technical corrections to the act are pending issuance and therefore it is not currently practicable to estimate the potential range of impact on income taxes

r effective june  sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using either the modified prospective or retrospective method 
the company is currently evaluating the alternative methods of adoption 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had the company adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the pro forma impact of sfas no 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates these estimates 
estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
historically  actual results have not been materially different from the company s estimates 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company has identified the following critical accounting policies used in determining estimates and assumptions in the amounts reported 
management believes that an understanding of these policies is important to an overall understanding of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s revenue consists of sales to customers  license fees and royalties 
revenue is recognized on the sale of products manufactured or sourced by the company when the related goods have been shipped and legal title has passed to the customer 
revenue generated through programs with licensees and distributors involving products bearing the company s trademarks is recognized as earned according to stated contractual terms upon either the purchase or shipment of branded products by distributors and licensees 
the company records provisions against gross revenue for estimated stock returns and cash discounts in the period when the related revenue is recorded 
these estimates are based on factors that include  but are not limited to  historical stock returns  historical discounts taken and analysis of credit memorandum activity 
the actual amount of customer returns or allowances  which is uncertain  may differ from the company s estimates 
the company would record either an increase or decrease to net sales in the period in which it determined an adjustment to be appropriate 
accounts receivable the company maintains an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from its customers inability to make required payments 
company management evaluates the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable based on a review of current customer status and historical collection experience 
historically  losses have been within the company s expectations 
adjustments to these estimates may be required if the financial condition of the company s customers were to change 
if the company were to determine that increases or decreases to the allowance for uncollectible accounts were appropriate  the company would record either an increase or decrease to general and administrative expenses in the period the company made such a determination 
at january  and january   management believes that it has provided sufficient reserves to address future collection uncertainties 
inventory the company values its inventory at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the last in  first out lifo method for all domestic raw materials and work in process inventories  and most domestic finished goods inventories 
cost is determined using methods approximating cost under the first in  first out fifo method for all raw materials  work in process and finished goods inventories in foreign countries where lifo is not permitted 
the fifo method is also used for all finished goods inventories of the company s retail business  due to the unique nature of that operation  and for certain domestic finished goods inventories that were acquired as part of asset purchase transactions 
once elected  the company has applied these inventory cost valuation methods consistently from year to year 
the company reduces the value of its inventories to the lower of cost or market for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if the company were to determine that the estimated market value of its inventory is less than the carrying value of such inventory  the company would provide a reserve for such difference as a charge to cost of sales 
if actual market conditions are different from those projected  adjustments to those inventory reserves may be required 
the adjustments would increase or decrease the company s cost of sales and net income in the period i n which they were realized or recorded 
inventory quantities are verified at various times throughout the year by performing annual physical inventory observations and perpetual inventory cycle count procedures 
if the company determines that adjustments to the inventory quantities are appropriate  an increase or decrease to the company s cost of sales and inventory would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made 
goodwill and other non amortizable intangibles goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to impairment tests at least annually 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test requires that the fair value of the applicable reporting unit be compared with its recorded value 
the company establishes fair value by calculating the present value of the future cash flows of the reporting unit 
the company uses assumptions about expected future operating performance in determining estimates of those cash flows  which may differ from actual cash flows 
if the recorded values of these assets are not recoverable  based on this discounted cash flow analysis  management performs the next step which compares the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one to the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets of the reporting unit  which results in an implied fair value of goodwill 
goodwill is reduced by any shortfall of implied goodwill to its carrying value 
impairment tests for other non amortiza ble intangibles require the determination of the fair value of the intangible asset 
the carrying value is reduced by any excess over fair value 
the company reviewed the carrying amounts of goodwill and other non amortizable intangible assets and there was no impairment indicated for or income taxes the company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the united states 
accordingly  management must determine the appropriate allocation of income in accordance with local law for each of these jurisdictions 
the company believes its tax accruals are adequate to cover exposures related to changes in income allocation between tax jurisdictions 
the carrying value of the company s deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient taxable income in future years to utilize these deferred tax assets 
if these assumptions change  the company may be required to record valuation allowances against its gross deferred tax assets in future years  which would result in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
management evaluates the potential for realizing gross deferred tax assets and assesses the need for valuation allowances on a quarterly basis 
the company did not record a valuation allowance in or on a periodic basis  the company estimates what the effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year and records a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the anticipated annual rate 
as the fiscal year progresses  that estimate is refined based upon actual events and earnings by tax jurisdictions during the year 
this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to the expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year 
when this occurs  the company adjusts the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision equals the expected annual rate 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company faces market risk to the extent that changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect the company s foreign assets  liabilities and inventory purchase commitments and to the extent that its long term debt requirements are affected by changes in interest rates 
the company manages these risks by attempting to denominate contractual and other foreign arrangements in us dollars and by maintaining a significant percentage of its debt on a fixed rate basis 
the company does not believe that there has been a material change in the nature of the company s primary market risk exposures  including the categories of market risk to which the company is exposed and the particular markets that present the primary risk of loss to the company 
as of the date of this annual report  the company does not know of or expect there to be any material change in the general nature of its primary market risk exposure in the near term 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas nos 
and  the company is required to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings 
if a derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in accumulated other comprehensive gain loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the company conducts wholesale operations outside of the united states in europe and canada where the functional currencies are primarily the british pound  euro  and canadian dollar 
the company utilizes foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage the volatility associated with inventory purchases made by non us wholesale operations in foreign currencies in the normal course of business 
at january  and january   the company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase million and million  respectively  of various currencies principally us dollars with maturities ranging up to days 
the company also has production facilities in the dominican republic where financial statements reflect us dollars as the functional currency  however  operating costs are paid in the local currency 
royalty revenue generated by the company from third party foreign licensees is calculated in the licensees local currencies  but paid in us dollars 
accordingly  the company could be subject to related foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses in and beyond 
assets and liabilities outside the united states are primarily located in the united kingdom  canada and the netherlands 
the company s investments in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar are generally considered long term 
accordingly  the company does not hedge these net investments 
for the years ended january  and january   the strengthening of foreign currencies increased the value of these investments in net assets by million and million  respectively 
this gain resulted in cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments at january  and january  of million and million  respectively  that are deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
because the company markets  sells and licenses its products throughout the world  it could be affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce demand for its products 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its long term debt requirements 
the company s interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the effect of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to effectively manage overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives  the company maintains substantially all fixed rate debt to take advantage of lower relative interest rates currently available and finances seasonal working capital needs with variable rate debt 
the company has not historically utilized interest rate swaps or similar hedging arrangements to fix interest rates  however  in the company entered into an interest rate lock agreement to fix the interest rate prior to the issuance of senior notes in the amount of million 
the contract was settled in and resulted in a prepayment of interest of million that is being amortized over the term of the senior notes 
the amortization of the prepayment creates an effective interest rate of on the senior notes 
the company does not enter into contracts for speculative or trading purposes  nor is it a party to any leveraged derivative instruments 
the following table lists required principal payments and related interest rates for the company s short and long term debt by fiscal year of maturity 
there after total fair value total fair value millions of dollars  except percentages denominated in us dollars fixed rate average interest rate the company has the following payments under contractual obligations due by period less than more than total year years years years thousands of dollars long term debt estimated interest on long term debt capital leases operating leases purchase obligations deferred compensation pension serp dividends declared minimum royalties minimum advertising total purchase obligations primarily relate to inventory and capital expenditure commitments 
pension obligations reflect only planned pension funding as there are currently no required funding obligations under government regulation 
funding amounts are calculated on an annual basis and no required or planned funding beyond one year has been determined
