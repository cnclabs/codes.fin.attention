general we are a full service  integrated retailer of premium transportation and construction equipment and related services 
the company operates a heavy duty truck segment and a construction equipment segment see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our rush truck centers primarily sell heavy duty trucks manufactured by peterbilt motors company peterbilt  a division of paccar  inc paccar 
we sold approximately of all the new peterbilt class trucks registered in the united states in some of our rush truck centers sell medium duty trucks manufactured by peterbilt  gmc  hino  ud nissan or isuzu 
we are also a supplier of john deere construction equipment through our rush equipment center in houston  texas 
through our strategically located network of rush truck centers and our rush equipment center  we provide one stop service for the needs of our customers  including retail sales of new and used transportation and construction equipment  aftermarket parts sales  service and repair facilities and financing  leasing and rental  and insurance services 
our rush truck centers are principally located in high traffic areas throughout the southern united states 
effective january   the company acquired certain assets of american truck source  inc ats  including its peterbilt truck dealerships in dallas  fort worth  abilene and tyler  texas and nashville  tennessee 
since commencing operations as a peterbilt heavy duty truck dealer over years ago  we have grown to operate rush truck centers at locations in alabama  arizona  california  colorado  florida  new mexico  oklahoma  tennessee and texas 
our rush equipment center in houston  texas sells  leases and rents a full line of john deere construction equipment for light to medium sized applications  as well as a variety of construction equipment trailers 
additionally  we sell a complete line of property and casualty insurance  including collision and liability insurance on trucks  cargo insurance  and credit life insurance through our affiliate  associated acceptance  inc we were founded and incorporated in in texas 
we currently conduct business through numerous subsidiaries  all of which are wholly owned  directly or indirectly  by us 
our principal offices are located at ih south  new braunfels  texas industry we currently operate in the heavy duty truck  medium duty truck and construction equipment markets 
there has historically been a high correlation in both of these markets between new product sales and the rate of change in us industrial production and the us gross domestic product 
heavy duty truck market the company serves the entire us retail heavy duty truck market  which is affected by a number of factors relating to general economic conditions  including fuel prices  government regulation  interest rate fluctuations  economic recessions and customer business cycles 
in addition  unit sales of new trucks have historically been subject to substantial cyclical variation based on such general economic conditions 
according to data published by rl polk  an industry research and publication firm  the overall domestic heavy duty truck market decreased from approximately  new class unit sales in to approximately  new class unit sales in during  rl polk estimates sales of domestic heavy duty class trucks increased to approximately  and sales of domestic heavy duty class trucks are expected to increase to approximately  units during according to act research co  llc act research  a heavy duty truck industry data and forecasting services provider 
our primary product line is peterbilt trucks  which  according to rl polk  accounted for approximately of all new heavy duty truck registrations in historically  peterbilt s market share in areas served by our dealerships has been significantly higher than its national average 
our share of the us class truck sales market was approximately in typically  class trucks are assembled by manufacturers utilizing certain components manufactured by other companies  including engines  transmissions  axles  wheels and other components 
as trucks and truck components have become increasingly complex  the ability to provide state of the art service for a wide variety of truck equipment has become a competitive factor in the industry 
the ability to provide such service requires a significant capital investment in diagnostic and other equipment  parts inventory and highly trained service personnel 
environmental protection agency epa and us department of transportation dot regulatory guidelines for service processes  including body shop  paint work and waste disposal  require sophisticated operating and testing equipment to ensure compliance with environmental and safety standards 
additionally  we believe that more of our customers will lease or rent class trucks as fleets  particularly private fleets  and seek to establish full service leases or rental contracts  which provide for turnkey service including parts  maintenance and  potentially  fuel  fuel tax reporting and other services 
as a result  differentiation between truck dealers has become less dependent on pure price competition and is increasingly based on a dealer s ability to offer a wide variety of services to their clients 
such services include efficient  conveniently located and easily accessible truck service centers with an adequate supply of replacement parts  financing for truck purchases  leasing and rental programs  and the ability to accept multiple unit trade ins related to large fleet purchases 
we believe our one stop center concept and the size and geographic diversity of our dealer network gives us a competitive advantage in providing these services 
the epa mandated that heavy duty engine manufacturers meet new  stricter emissions guidelines regarding nitrous oxides for all engines built subsequent to october  these new guidelines increased the price of new heavy duty trucks by approximately  to  per unit and were expected to reduce the operating efficiency and life cycle of heavy duty trucks 
as a result  the company experienced stronger than usual truck sales during the second half of as customers made purchases of trucks manufactured under the old emission laws 
this accelerated demand in the second half of was followed by a short term decrease in demand during the first half of  which was followed by an increase in demand that has continued since the second half of the epa has placed additional guidelines  further restricting the emissions of nitrous oxides  for all engines built subsequent to january  as it did in  the industry has historically experienced an accelerated demand for trucks in the months preceding the effective date of the change in epa guidelines  followed by a short term decrease in demand in the months subsequent to the change 
the company does not expect the change in emission guidelines to have an effect on its results from operations 
the company believes it is too early to determine how the future changes in emission guidelines will affect its results from operations subsequent to the heavy duty truck industry as a whole is expected to deliver approximately  new trucks in the united states during  compared to approximately  new trucks in   new trucks in and  new trucks in the and new heavy duty truck sales totals were the lowest heavy duty truck sales totals in the last nine years 
management believes the long term growth prospects for the heavy duty truck industry remain positive 
factors  which management believes favor the continued long term growth in the heavy duty truck industry  include the following continued growth in demand for consumer and industrial goods  in part as a result of the internet  which has fostered a desire by consumers to receive home delivery of a wider selection of packages  continued competitive pressures for just in time manufacturing processes where us manufacturers are demanding faster  yet less costly  small shipment services  the rise of intermodal service which utilizes the inherent advantages of both highway and rail transportation to provide consumers with a consistent and low cost method to transport their goods  and the continued increase of cross border truck traffic between mexico and the united states as a result of nafta 
medium duty truck market several of our rush truck centers sell medium duty trucks manufactured by peterbilt  gmc  hino  ud nissan or isuzu  and provide parts and service for medium duty trucks 
medium duty trucks are principally used in short haul  local markets as delivery vehicles 
medium duty trucks typically operate locally and generally do not venture out of their service areas overnight 
the nature of the medium duty truck market promotes the use of our service facilities during our evening shift  which is traditionally a slow period for heavy duty truck service 
act research estimates that retail sales of class through medium duty trucks totaled approximately  units in we plan to expand our share of this market by adding new product lines  medium duty dealership locations and sales personnel 
for example  we recently began selling hino medium duty trucks at our new dallas  texas full service medium duty dealership 
construction equipment market our rush equipment center is an authorized john deere construction equipment dealer  which sells equipment targeted towards light and medium construction applications 
our rush equipment center serves houston  texas and the surrounding area 
according to the data compiled by john deere  approximately  units of construction equipment were put into use in our area of responsibility in compared to  in the construction equipment industry analysts expect approximately  units of new construction equipment to be sold in the houston area during the company s market share in the houston area was in and in our rush equipment center has the right to sell new john deere construction equipment and parts within its assigned area of responsibility  which means competition within its market comes primarily from dealers of competing manufacturers and rental companies 
john deere equipment users are a diverse group that includes residential and commercial construction businesses  independent rental companies  utility companies  government agencies  and various petrochemical  industrial and material supply businesses 
industry statistics suggest that a majority of all construction equipment is owned by a relatively small percentage of the customer base 
accordingly  john deere and its dealer group  including the rush equipment center  are aggressively developing more sophisticated ways to serve large fleet owners 
market factors affecting the construction equipment industry include the following levels of commercial  residential  and public construction activities  state and federal highway and road construction appropriations  and the consolidation and growth of the construction equipment rental business 
our business strategy operating strategy 
our strategy is to operate an integrated dealer network that primarily markets peterbilt heavy duty trucks  medium duty trucks from various manufacturers and john deere construction equipment and provides complementary products and services 
our strategy includes the following key elements one stop centers 
we have developed our truck and construction equipment dealerships as one stop centers where  at one convenient location  our customers can do the following purchase new or used trucks or construction equipment  finance  lease or rent trucks or construction equipment  purchase aftermarket parts and accessories  and have service performed by certified technicians 
we believe that this full service strategy also helps to mitigate cyclical economic fluctuations because the parts and service sales at our dealerships generally tend to be less volatile than our new and used truck and construction equipment sales 
branding program 
we employ a branding program for our dealerships through distinctive signage and uniform marketing programs to take advantage of our existing name recognition and to communicate the standardized high quality of our products and reliability of our services throughout our dealership network 
management by dealership units 
our dealership general managers measure and manage the business operations of each of our dealerships according to the specific business units operating at that location 
at each of our dealerships  we operate one or more of the following business units new sales  used sales  parts  service  body shop  leasing  rental or financial services 
we believe that this system enhances the profitability of all aspects of a dealership and increases our overall operating margins 
operating goals for each business unit at each of our dealerships are established annually and managers are rewarded for performance accordingly 
integrated management information systems 
in order to efficiently operate separate business units within each dealership  we rely upon our management information systems to determine and monitor appropriate inventory levels and product mix at each rush truck center 
each rush truck center maintains a centralized real time inventory tracking system that is accessible simultaneously by all locations 
our automated reordering system assists each rush truck center in maintaining the proper inventory levels and typically permits inventory delivery to each location  or directly to customers  within hours from the time the order is placed 
in addition  by actively monitoring market conditions  assessing product and expansion strategies and remaining abreast of changes within the market  we are able to proactively address market by market changes by realigning and  if necessary  adding product lines and models 
growth strategy 
through our expansion and acquisition initiatives  we have grown to operate a large  multistate  full service network of heavy duty truck dealerships 
as described below  we intend to continue to grow our business internally and through acquisitions by expanding into new geographic areas  expanding our product offerings and capabilities and opening new one stop truck and equipment centers in existing markets 
expansion into new geographic areas 
we plan to continue to expand our rush truck center network and build a rush equipment center network by acquiring additional dealerships in geographic areas contiguous to our current operations 
we have successfully expanded our presence from our texas base into a coast to coast network of rush truck centers 
we believe the geographic diversity of our rush truck center network has significantly expanded our customer base while ameliorating the effects of local economic cycles 
geographic diversification supports the sale of trucks and parts by allowing us to allocate our inventory among the geographic regions we serve based on market demand within these regions 
expansion of product offerings and capabilities 
we intend to continue to expand our product lines within our rush truck centers and our rush equipment center by adding product categories that are both complementary to our peterbilt and john deere product lines and well suited to our operating model 
for example  we expanded into the construction equipment industry based on a common customer base among our heavy duty truck and construction equipment purchasers 
we have also introduced trailer repair and maintenance services and the sale of truck mounted cranes at certain rush truck centers 
other recent product line expansions include the introduction of hino and ud nissan medium duty truck franchises at some of our rush truck centers 
we believe that there are many additional product and service offerings that would complement our primary product lines 
we expect any product category expansion that we pursue to satisfy our requirements that the products are of a premium brand  the products provide opportunities for incremental income through related servicing  aftermarket sales or financing  and rush operating controls can be implemented to enhance the financial performance of the business 
open new rush truck and equipment centers in existing markets 
we believe that there are opportunities to increase our share of the heavy duty truck and construction equipment markets by introducing our one stop centers to underserved markets within the southern united states 
the introduction of additional one stop centers would enable us to enhance revenues from our existing customer base as well as increase the awareness of the rush brand name for new customers 
we believe there would also be opportunities for cost savings by integrating the inventory management and operations of additional new locations with those in our existing network 
in identifying new areas for expansion  we analyze the target market s level of new heavy duty truck registrations and construction equipment purchases  customer buying and leasing trends and the existence of competing franchises 
we also assess the potential performance of a parts and service center to determine whether a market is suitable for a rush truck center 
after a market has been strategically reviewed  we survey the region for a well situated location 
whether we acquire existing dealerships or open a new rush truck center  we will introduce our branding program and implement our integrated management system

each of our dealerships is identified as either a rush truck center or rush equipment center 
in the houston  texas area  we are making a concerted effort to target our products and services to existing truck customers that are also involved in the construction business 
facility management personnel 
each rush truck center and the rush equipment center is managed by a general manager who oversees the operations  personnel and the financial performance of the location  subject to the direction of our corporate office 
additionally  each rush truck center is typically staffed by a sales manager  parts manager  service manager  sales representatives  parts employees  and other service and makeready employees

management information systems 
each rush truck center and the rush equipment center maintains a centralized real time inventory tracking system which is accessible simultaneously by all locations and by our corporate office

from information assimilated from management information systems  management has developed a model reflecting historic sales levels of different product lines 
this model enables management to identify the appropriate level and combination of inventory and forms the basis of our operating plan 
our management information systems and databases are also used to monitor market conditions and sales information and assess product and expansion strategies 
information received from state and regulatory agencies  manufacturers  industry analysts and industry contacts allows us to determine market share statistics and gross volume sales numbers for our products as well as those of competitors 
this information impacts ongoing operations because management remains aware of changes within the markets we service and is able to react accordingly by realigning product lines and by adding new product lines and models 
distribution and inventory management 
we utilize a real time inventory management tracking system to maintain a close link between each rush truck center 
this link allows for timely and cost effective sharing of managerial and sales information as well as the prompt transfer of inventory among various locations 
the transfer of inventory reduces delays in delivery  helps maximize inventory turns and assists in controlling problems created by overstock and understock situations 
we are linked directly to our major suppliers  including paccar  gmc  and john deere  via real time communication links for purposes of ordering and inventory management

recent acquisitions and dispositions effective january   we acquired certain assets of ats  including its peterbilt truck dealerships in dallas  fort worth  abilene and tyler  texas and nashville  tennessee  for a total purchase price of million 
the acquisition provides us with the right to sell peterbilt trucks and parts in these locations 
the acquisition expands our presence in the southern united states and results in the company operating rush truck centers at locations in nine states 
in november  we decided to discontinue our retail segment  which operated three d d farm and ranch supermarket d d retail stores in denton  hockley and seguin  texas because it did not fit into our long term plans of growing our core truck and construction equipment businesses 
the denton store was closed in december  the hockley store began liquidating inventory during november and completed the liquidation in march the company sold the seguin store and the hockley real estate in the fourth quarter of in november  we sold certain assets of our wholly owned subsidiary  rush truck centers of louisiana  inc the transaction was valued at approximately million and paid in cash

in november  we decided to sell our michigan john deere construction equipment stores as a result of continuing deterioration in the michigan construction equipment market and the location of the stores in relation to our other operations and plans for future expansion 
the sale of the michigan construction equipment stores was substantially complete at december  competition there is  and will continue to be  significant competition both within our current markets and in the new markets we may enter 
we anticipate that competition between us and other dealers will continue to increase in our current markets and on a national level based on the following the accessibility of dealership locations  the number of dealership locations  price  value  quality and design of the products sold  and attention to customer service including technical service 
our new truck products compete with trucks made by other manufacturers and sold through competing independent and factory owned truck dealerships  including trucks manufactured by navistar  mack  freightliner  kenworth  volvo  ford motor company  western star truck holdings  ltd  and other manufacturers 
kenworth heavy duty trucks are also manufactured by paccar  peterbilt s parent company  but are distributed through a different network of competing dealers 
our construction equipment products compete with construction equipment manufactured by case  caterpillar  komatsu and other manufacturers 
we believe that our dealerships are able to compete with manufacturer dealers  independent dealers and wholesalers  rental service companies and industrial auctioneers in distributing our products on the basis of overall product quality and reputation  rush brand name recognition and reputation for reliability  and our ability to provide comprehensive full parts and service support  as well as financing  insurance and other customer services

employees on december   we had  employees 
we have no contracts or collective bargaining agreements with labor unions and have never experienced work stoppages 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
seasonality the company s heavy duty truck business is moderately seasonal 
seasonal effects on new truck sales related to the seasonal purchasing patterns of any single customer type are mitigated by the company s diverse customer base  including small and large fleets  governments  corporations and owner operators 
however  truck parts and service operations historically have experienced higher volumes of sales in the second and third quarters 
seasonal effects in the construction equipment business are primarily driven by the weather 
seasonal effects on construction equipment sales related to the seasonal purchasing patterns of any single customer type are mitigated by the company s diverse customer base that includes contractors for residential and commercial construction  utility companies  federal  state and local government agencies  and various petrochemical  industrial and material supply type businesses that require construction equipment in their daily operations 
backlog on december   the company s backlog of truck orders was approximately million as compared to a backlog of truck orders of approximately million on december  the company includes in its backlog only confirmed orders 
it currently takes between days and six months for the company to receive delivery from peterbilt once an order is placed depending on vehicle specifications and demand 
the company sells the majority of its new heavy duty trucks by customer special order  with the remainder sold out of inventory 
orders from a number of the company s major fleet customers are included in the company s backlog as of december environmental standards and other governmental regulations our operations are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations  including laws and regulations designed to protect the environment by regulating the discharge of materials into the environment 
the epa mandated that heavy duty engine manufacturers meet new  stricter emissions guidelines regarding nitrous oxides for all engines built subsequent to october  and the epa has placed additional guidelines  further restricting the emissions of nitrous oxides for all engines built subsequent to january  in  the industry experienced an accelerated demand for trucks  as it historically has in the months preceding the effective date of a change in epa engine emission guidelines  this was followed by a short term decrease in demand in the months subsequent to the change 
the company does not expect the change in emission guidelines to have an affect on its results from operations 
the company believes it is too early to accurately determine how the future changes in emission guidelines will affect its results from operations subsequent to termination of dealership agreements upon a change of control a substantial percentage of our revenues is derived from sales of peterbilt trucks and john deere construction equipment products 
therefore  our business is highly dependent on our dealership agreements with peterbilt and john deere  which authorize us to sell peterbilt and john deere products in our market areas 
our dealership agreements with peterbilt are terminable by peterbilt in the event the aggregate voting power of mr 
w 
marvin rush mr 
rush and his family decreases below with respect to the election of directors 
the john deere dealership agreement would similarly be terminable by john deere if the aggregate voting power of mr 
rush and his family were to decrease below 
as of december   mr 
rush and his family owned  shares of the company s class a common stock  
par value per share the class a common stock  and  shares of the company s class b common stock  
par value per share the class b common stock  or approximately of the company s outstanding voting power 
the company has no control over the transfer or disposition of the shares of the company s common stock by mr 
rush or by mr 
rush s estate 
if mr 
rush were to sell his class b common stock  bequest his class b common stock to nonfamily members or if mr 
rush s estate were required to liquidate his class b common stock to pay estate taxes or otherwise  the change of control provisions of the dealership agreements described above could be triggered and cause the company to lose its critical right to sell peterbilt and john deere products 
any loss of rights under its dealership agreements would have a severely adverse effect on the company s results of operations

since commencing operations as a peterbilt heavy duty truck dealer over years ago  we have grown to operate rush truck centers  which primarily sell new class heavy duty peterbilt trucks  at locations in alabama  arizona  california  colorado  florida  new mexico  oklahoma  tennessee and texas 
class trucks are defined by the american automobile association as trucks with a minimum gross vehicle weight rating above  pounds 
our rush truck centers are strategically located to take advantage of ever increasing cross border traffic between the united states and mexico resulting from implementation of nafta

financial and insurance services 
through our dealerships we offer third party financing to assist customers in purchasing new and used trucks and construction equipment 
additionally  we sell a complete line of property and casualty insurance  including collision and liability insurance on trucks  cargo insurance and credit life insurance 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
the company believes the following accounting policies  which are also described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined by specific identification for new and used truck and construction equipment inventory and by the first in  first out method for tires  parts and accessories 
an allowance is provided when it is anticipated that cost will exceed net realizable value 
other assets 
other assets consist primarily of goodwill related to acquisitions and other intangible assets 
as stated in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  financial accounting standards board statement no 
sfas provides that goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives will not be amortized  but instead must be tested at least annually for impairment  and intangible assets that have finite useful lives should continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
sfas also provides specific guidance for testing goodwill and other nonamortized intangible assets for impairment 
sfas requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions in order to allocate goodwill to reporting units and to determine the fair value of a reporting unit s net assets and liabilities  including  among other things  an assessment of market condition  projected cash flows  interest rates and growth rates  which could significantly impact the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires  in lieu of amortization  an annual impairment review of goodwill 
the company did not record an impairment charge related to the goodwill for its continuing operations as a result of its december  impairment review 
the company did  however  record an impairment of goodwill related to its discontinued operations at december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
furthermore  sfas exposes the company to the possibility that changes in market conditions could result in significant impairment charges in the future  thus resulting in a potential increase in earnings volatility 
revenue recognition policies 
income on the sale of a vehicle or a piece of construction equipment is recognized when the customer executes a purchase contract with us  the unit has been delivered to the customer and there are no significant uncertainties related to financing or collectibility 
lease and rental income is recognized over the period of the related lease or rental agreement 
parts and service revenue is earned at the time the company sells the parts to its customers or at the time the company completes the service work order related to service provided to the customer s unit 
payments received on prepaid maintenance plans are deferred as a component of accrued expenses and recognized as income when the maintenance is performed 
finance and insurance revenue recognition 
finance income related to the sale of a unit is recognized over the period of the respective finance contract if the finance contract is retained by the company  based on the effective interest rate method 
during  and  no finance contracts were retained for any significant length of time by the company because finance contracts are generally sold to finance companies concurrent with the sale of the related unit 
the majority of finance contracts are sold without recourse 
the company s liability related to finance contracts sold with recourse is generally limited to to of the outstanding amount of each note initiated on behalf of the finance company 
however  in the company instituted a full recourse finance program that accepts liability  with some restrictions  for the outstanding amount of each note initiated on behalf of the finance company 
in order for a contract to be accepted into this full recourse finance program  a customer must meet strict credit requirements or maintain a significant equity position in the truck being financed  therefore  less than one percent of the finance contracts sold by the company are currently sold under the full recourse finance program and the company does not expect to finance a significant percentage of its truck sales under this full recourse finance program in the future 
the company provides for an allowance for repossession losses and early repayment penalties 
the company arranges financing for customers through various financial institutions and receives a commission from the lender equal to the difference between the interest rates charged to customers over the predetermined interest rates set by the financing institution 
the company also receives commissions from the sale of various insurance products to customers and extended service contracts 
revenue is recognized by the company upon the sale of such finance and insurance contracts to the finance and insurance companies  net of a provision for estimated repossession losses and interest charge backs 
the company is not the obligor under any of these contracts 
in the case of finance contracts  a customer may prepay  or fail to pay  thereby terminating the contract 
if the customer terminates a retail finance contract or other insurance product prior to scheduled maturity  a portion of the commissions previously paid to the company may be charged back to the company depending on the terms of the relevant contracts 
the estimate of ultimate charge back exposure is based on the company s historical charge back expense arising from similar contracts  including the impact of refinance and default rates on retail finance contracts and cancellation rates on other insurance products 
the actual amount of historical charge backs has not been significantly different than the company s estimates 
insurance accruals 
the company is self insured for medical  workers compensation  and property and casualty insurance and calculates a reserve for those claims that have been incurred but not reported and for the remaining portion of those claims that have been reported 
the company uses information provided by the third party administrators to determine the reasonableness of the calculations they perform 
results of operations the following discussion and analysis includes the company s historical results of operations for  and the following table sets forth for the years indicated certain financial data as a percentage of total revenues year ended december  new and used truck sales parts and service construction equipment sales lease and rental finance and insurance other total revenues cost of products sold gross profit selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization operating income from continuing operations interest expense  net gain on sale of assets income before income taxes from continuing operations income taxes income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues increased million  or  from million in to billion in sales of new and used trucks increased million  or  from million in to million in unit sales of new class trucks increased  from  units in to  units in the increase in class units sales is being driven by the industry s need to replace aging equipment after three consecutive years of us truck sales lagging behind the normal replacement cycle 
the company s average sales price per class truck remained relatively flat from to at  based on estimates from act research  the company believes that the deliveries of class trucks in the united states will increase in to approximately  units 
in  the company retained a share of the us class truck sales market 
on a same store basis  the company expects to maintain this share in  which would result in same store sales of approximately  class trucks based on the number of us deliveries estimated by us research 
in addition to same store sales  the company expects the recent acquisition of ats to increase our unit sales of class trucks in in  ats maintained a share of the us class truck sales market 
the company expects ats to maintain this share in  which would result in the sale of approximately  class trucks 
these additional sales would bring the company s expected heavy duty truck sales to  units in industry expectations are for class truck deliveries to continue to increase through and then soften in primarily due to future emission laws  which are expected to increase the cost and reduce the efficiency of engines built on or after january  unit sales of new medium duty trucks increased  from units in to  units in in  the company continued its concerted effort to improve its medium duty truck sales by adding experienced medium duty sales personnel  and introducing new class through medium duty franchises at some of our rush truck centers to complement the existing peterbilt medium duty line  which consists primarily of class trucks 
class through unit truck sales accounted for of the company s medium duty unit sales in compared to in the average sales price for class through models during was  compared to  for the class peterbilt medium duty model 
the increase in the percentage of class through trucks sold by the company in resulted in a decrease in our average medium duty truck sales price in compared to overall  new medium duty truck sales revenue increased million in compared to in  the company expects to continue to add medium duty franchises to certain dealerships and to increase its same store medium duty sales and market share compared to the company expects the recent acquisition of ats to increase unit sales of medium duty trucks by approximately during unit sales of used trucks increased  from  units in to  units in used truck average revenue per unit increased by 
historically  used truck demand is consistent with new truck demand 
the company expects used truck demand to remain high  however  our ability to sell used trucks is ultimately dependent upon our ability to acquire used trucks for resale 
the company expects the recent acquisition of ats to increase unit sales of used trucks by approximately during parts and service sales increased million  or  from million in to million in same store parts and service sales increased million  or  in compared to the increase in parts and service sales was due to a combination of new business development  price increases for parts and labor  extension of our business hours and expansion of capacity made possible by the addition of service bays and technicians to certain locations 
the company expects same store parts and service revenue to increase by approximately in the company expects the recent acquisition of ats to increase parts and service sales by an additional in  which would result in an overall increase in parts and service sales of in compared to sales of new and used construction equipment increased million  or  from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to a change in product mix and price increases 
according to john deere  the company s market share in the houston area construction equipment market was in compared to in in  we focused on increasing our margins  which had an adverse effect on our market share 
according to data compiled by john deere  approximately  units of construction equipment were put into use in our area of responsibility in compared to  in the construction equipment industry expects to sell approximately  units of new construction equipment in the houston area during the company believes it can increase its market share slightly in compared to lease and rental revenues increased  from million in to million in the increase in truck lease and rental revenue was due to the increase in our customer base during the company expects lease and rental revenue to increase approximately during compared to due to an increased number of units in the lease and rental fleet and the recent acquisition of ats 
finance and insurance revenues increased  from million in to million in this increase is directly related to the increase in new and used truck revenue 
the company expects same store finance and insurance revenues to increase in the company expects increased same store truck sales and the addition of the ats locations to increase finance and insurance revenues by approximately million in finance and insurance revenues have limited direct costs and  therefore  contribute a disproportionate share of operating profits 
other income increased million  or  from million in to million in other income revenue is primarily related to the gain on sale realized on trucks from the lease and rental fleet  commissions earned from john deere for direct manufacturer sales into our area of responsibility  document fees related to truck sales and purchase discounts

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations  or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial market prices  including interest rate risk  and other relevant market rate or price risks 
the company is exposed to some market risk through interest rates  related to our floor plan borrowing arrangements  variable rate debt and discount rates related to finance sales

the company provides all customer financing opportunities to various finance providers 
the company receives all finance charges in excess of a negotiated discount rate from the finance providers in the month following the date of the financing 
the negotiated discount rate is variable  thus subject to interest rate fluctuations 
this interest rate risk is mitigated by the company s ability to pass discount rate increases to customers through higher financing rates 
the company is also exposed to some market risk through interest rates related to the investment of our current cash and cash equivalents of million at december  the company used million of these funds for the ats acquisition on january   leaving million available for investment 
these funds are generally invested in highly liquid money market accounts  government sponsored enterprises and corporate bonds that do not expose the company to a loss of principal 
as such instruments mature and the funds are reinvested  we are exposed to changes in market interest rates 
this risk is mitigated as a result of management s ongoing evaluation of the best investment rates available for current and noncurrent high quality investments 
if market interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately and uniformly by basis points  based on the company s excess cash on january  of million  the company s interest income could correspondingly increase or decrease by approximately million 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio
