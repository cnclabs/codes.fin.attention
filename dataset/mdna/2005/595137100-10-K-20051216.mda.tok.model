table of contents the following table reflects the activities related to the consolidation of ireland and the accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at the date below amounts in s employee severance other related costs total provisions cash expenditures balance at october  critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states that require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
information with respect to our critical accounting policies which we believe could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments is contained herein 
revenue recognition  sales returns and allowances we recognize revenue to all customers  including distributors  when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer provided that evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for substantially all sales  revenues are recognized at the time the product is shipped to customers 
we enter into contracts with certain distributors and these contracts permit very limited stock rotation returns 
the company provides an estimated allowance for such returns  and corresponding reductions in revenue are concurrently recorded  based on several factors including past history and notification from customers of pending returns 
actual returns have been within management s expectations 
in accordance with eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  estimated reductions to revenue are also recorded for customer incentive programs consisting of volume purchase rebates 
such programs are limited and actual reductions to revenues have been within management s expectations 
we provide a one year product defect warranty from the date of sale 
historically  warranty costs have been nominal and have been within management s expectations 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest 
the accounts receivable amounts shown in the balance sheet are trade account receivable balances at the respective dates  net of allowance for possible returns and doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we determine the allowance based on our historical write off experience 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly 
past due balances over days and over a specified amount are reviewed individually for collectibility 
all other balances are reviewed on a pooled basis by type of receivable 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when we determine it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 

table of contents actual bad debt has been within our expectations and the provisions established and has been consistent with experience of prior years  however  any unexpected significant adverse financial position of any of our major customers or any group of customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of accounts receivable and future operating results 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  as determined using the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
costs include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
we evaluate the carrying value of our inventories taking into account such factors as historical and anticipated future sales compared with quantities on hand and the price we expect to obtain for our products in their respective markets 
we also evaluate the composition of our inventories to identify any slow moving or obsolete products 
the total evaluations require material management judgments  including estimates of future sales  continuing market acceptance of our products  and market and economic conditions 
additionally  inventory reserves are established based upon such judgments for any inventories that are identified as having a net realizable value less than their cost  which is further reduced by related selling expenses 
historically  the net realizable value of our inventories has generally been within management s estimates 
however  if we are unable to meet our sales expectations  or if market conditions deteriorate from management s estimates  reductions in the net realizable value of our inventories could have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
long lived assets we assess the impairment of property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from their use 
at october   intangible assets  net include approximately million of non patented technology  million of acquired customer lists  and million of contract manufacturer relationships 
we are required to make judgments and assumptions in identifying those events or changes in circumstances that may trigger impairment 
some of the factors we consider include significant decrease in the market value of an asset 
significant changes in the extent or manner for which the asset is being used or in its physical condition 
a significant change  delay or departure in our business strategy related to the asset 
significant negative changes in the business climate  industry or economic conditions 
current period operating losses or negative cash flow combined with a history of similar losses or a forecast that indicates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset 
an evaluation under fas includes an analysis of estimated future undiscounted net cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining estimated useful lives 
if the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets over the remaining estimated useful lives  we will recognize an impairment loss which equals to the excess of the carrying value of the assets over the fair value 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
major factors that influence our cash flow analysis are our estimates for future revenues and expenses associated with the use of the asset 
different estimates could have a significant impact on the results of our evaluation 
goodwill we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas at the beginning of fiscal year  which changed the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only 
table of contents approach 
accordingly  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized  while those intangible assets with known useful lives have continued to be amortized over their respective useful lives 
at least annually  we are required to reassess goodwill 
whenever we determine that there has been an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives  we will record an impairment charge against earnings  which equals the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its then fair value  and a reduction in goodwill on our balance sheet 
the identification of intangible assets and determination of the fair value and useful lives are subjective in nature and often involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
the judgments made in determining the estimated useful lives assigned to each class of assets can significantly affect net income 
at the beginning of fiscal year  we had approximately million of unamortized goodwill that resulted from our previous acquisitions 
for the purposes of the evaluation as required by fas  the reporting units with goodwill were identified as scottsdale million  santa ana million  integrated products million  lawrence million and lowell million 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the impairment charge was calculated as the excess  if any  of the carrying amount of goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill for each reporting unit based on a combination of the market approach weighted and the income approach weighted 
the valuation resulted in a million of goodwill impairment at integrated products  lawrence and lowell 
as required by sfas no 
 a million transition impairment charge was recorded  net of its associated million tax benefit  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  effective as of the beginning of fiscal year at september   we had approximately million of goodwill that resulted from our previous acquisitions  of which million was allocated to santa ana and million was allocated to scottsdale 
as a consequence of the consolidation of santa ana  the million of goodwill was reallocated to scottsdale in fiscal year the total million of goodwill remained unchanged as of october  we are required by fas to reassess goodwill annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred 
we are required to record a charge to income if an impairment has been incurred 
we performed our annual review for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal we have determined that no impairment existed because the assets and liabilities that make up the reporting units at october  have not changed significantly since the most recent fair value determination 
the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting unit by a substantial margin 
based on an analysis of events that have occurred and circumstances that have changed since the most recent fair value determination  the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is remote 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we have a nexus 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
we have established a valuation allowance for a portion of our deferred tax assets 
if we increase any valuation allowance in a period  it will adversely affect the tax provision in the income statement 
on october   president bush signed into law the working families tax relief act of the act 
the act retroactively extended the expiration date of the research tax credit from june  to december  since the credit was reinstated after september   the company recognized 
table of contents credits from september  through june  in fiscal year the impact from retroactive reinstatement of the credit from july  through september  was recognized in the first quarter of the fiscal year stock based compensation we account for employee stock options in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
under apb  no compensation expense is recognized for stock options or restricted stock issued to employees with exercise prices at or above quoted market value 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas provides an alternative to apb in accounting for stock based compensation issued to employees 
sfas provides for a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock options and similar equity instruments 
however  companies that continue to account for stock based compensation arrangements under apb are required by sfas to disclose the pro forma effect on net loss income and net loss income per share as if the fair value based method prescribed by sfas had been applied 
we continue to account for stock based compensation using the provisions of apb and present the pro forma information required by sfas as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure fas 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in august  we announced that we would accelerate the vesting of certain unvested stock options  all previously awarded to eligible participants under our stock plan  as amended 
upon our planned adoption of fasb statement no 
r  share based payment  effective for fiscal year  vesting of unvested options will add to our compensation expense 
therefore  we accelerated vesting into fiscal year before the new accounting rule takes effect 
we have imposed substantial restrictions on all shares issued under the accelerated options 
these restrictions prevent the selling of any shares acquired upon the exercise of accelerated options except as necessary to cover the exercise price and satisfy taxes until the date on which such options would have vested under their original vesting schedule 
as a result of this vesting acceleration  options to purchase approximately million shares of common stock became vested and exercisable on september   including approximately million shares held by executive officers 
the intrinsic value of the accelerated options is approximately million  of which million relate to options held by executive officers 
compensation expense that would have been recorded absent the accelerated vesting is approximately million  of which approximately million would have been in fiscal year we recorded a million non cash compensation charge as a result of the accelerated vesting related to the intrinsic value  on the acceleration date  of those options that would have been forfeited had the vesting not been accelerated 
in determining the forfeiture rates  the company reviewed the impact of divisions that were previously sold or consolidated  one time events that are not expected to recur and whether options were held by executive officers of the company 
the compensation charge will be adjusted in future periods as actual forfeitures are realized 
results of operations for the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year net sales increased million or from million for fiscal year to million for fiscal year primarily due to better pricing for certain high reliability products and higher volume of shipments for certain products 
the increase included approximately million  million  million  million of higher net sales for defense and aerospace  medical products  notebook computers  monitors and lcd tvs and mobile connectivity  respectively  partially offset by decreases of approximately million and million in net sales of automotive and other products  respectively

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and stock market

we did not enter into derivative financial instruments and did not enter into any other financial instruments for trading  speculative purposes or to manage our interest rate risk 
our other financial instruments consist primarily of cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and long term obligations 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short term investments and short term obligations 
as a result  we do not expect fluctuations in interest rates to have a material impact on the fair value of these instruments 
we do not engage in transactions intended to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates 
we currently have a  revolving line of credit  which expires in march at october    was utilized for a letter of credit  consequently   was available under this line of credit 
it bears interest at the bank s prime rate plus to per annum or  at our option  at the eurodollar rate plus to per annum 
the interest rate is determined by the ratio of total funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
for instance  if we were to borrow presently the entire  from this credit line  a one percent increase in the interest rate would result in an additional  of pre tax interest expense annually
