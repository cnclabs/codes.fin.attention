item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if semiconductor manufacturers fail to adopt simox technology during the current or subsequent process cycle such cycles typically last two to three years  widespread adoption of simox technology may never materialize  our technology may become obsolete and we may be required to recognize an additional material impairment loss in the future 
in addition  although we are aware of no other company manufacturing oxygen implant equipment  other major semiconductor implant equipment manufacturers could develop a less expensive oxygen implanter with superior technology 
our ability to compete with other manufacturers of semiconductor implanters  manufacturers of competing soi wafers  as well as with bulk silicon  epitaxial  strained silicon and compound materials wafer manufacturers  will depend on numerous factors within and outside our control  including the success and timing of our product introductions and those of our competitors  product distribution  customer support  sufficiency of funding available to us  and the price  quality and performance of competing products and technologies 
we must continually improve existing products  design and sell new products and manage the costs of research and development in order to compete effectively 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards and continuous improvements in products and required customer specifications 
due to the constant changes in our markets  our future success depends on our ability to improve our manufacturing processes  improve existing products and develop new products 
for example  our oxygen implanters must remain competitive on the basis of cost of ownership  process performance and evolving customer needs 
to remain competitive we must continually introduce oxygen implanters with higher capacity  better production yields and the ability to process larger wafer sizes 
the commercialization of new products involves  among other requirements  substantial expenditures in research and development  production and marketing 
we may be unable to successfully design or manufacture these new products and may have difficulty penetrating new markets 
because it is generally not possible to predict the amount of time required and the costs involved in achieving certain research  development and engineering objectives  actual development costs may exceed budgeted amounts and estimated product development schedules may be extended 
our business may be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to improve our existing products on a timely basis  our new products are not introduced on a timely basis  we incur budget overruns or delays in our research and development efforts  or our new products experience reliability or quality problems 
the sales cycle for our oxygen implanter equipment is lengthy and complex and we have only received limited orders for our oxygen implanter equipment 
our customers expend significant efforts in evaluating and qualifying our implanters before they place orders with us 
since we began selling implanters in  we have only sold a total of eight ibis oxygen implanters at an average sale price of approximately million each and two i oxygen implanters excluding the order received in january at a selling price between and million 
the sales cycle typically goes from equipment demonstration  equipment specification negotiations  formal quotation  contract negotiations and receipt of order and could take up to one year or longer 
in addition  our potential equipment customers that would like to use the mld process  owned by ibm  to manufacture simox soi wafers using our implanters would be required to license this technology directly from ibm 
we believe two silicon wafer manufacturers have already licensed this technology from ibm and others have developed their own simox processes 
our potential equipment customers may wish to secure this license prior to giving us an order for equipment and these negotiations between ibm and our customer are beyond our control and no assurances are given that our customers and ibm would come to terms acceptable to both parties in a timely manner  or at all 
these mld process license issues may effect the timing of placement of customer orders in the future if customers plan to license this technology 
we do not expect to sell more than a limited number of implanters in the near future 
the sale of one implanter would generally represent a substantial portion of our annual revenue 
accordingly  the delay in the receipt of orders  manufacture or delivery of even one unit or the modification  change or cancellation of any such order would have a material adverse effect on our quarterly and annual results of operations 
the manufacturing and customer qualification process for our implanters is complex  lengthy and costly 
in the semiconductor industry customers regularly require equipment manufacturers to qualify the equipment at the customer s site 
the time required to customer qualify an implanter at a customer s site is very difficult to predict because the qualification process for each of our implanters is complex  lengthy and costly and varies depending on our customer s varying specifications 
the manufacturing and qualification process for each implanter requires us to construct and customer qualify the machine at our premises  disassemble the machine for transportation  and reassemble and re qualify it at the customer s premises 
during this qualification period  we invest significant resources and dedicate substantial production and technical personnel to achieve acceptance of the implanter 
a customer will not accept the implanter until it has successfully produced wafers to exact specifications at the customer s premises 
even very small differences in the customer s environment or initially imperceptible changes that may occur to the implanter during the transportation to and reassembly of the implanter at the customer s site can cause a large percentage of wafers produced by the implanter to be rejected  which would delay the acceptance of the implanter by the customer 
historically  we have experienced delays in achieving customer acceptance 
delays or difficulties in our manufacturing and qualification process could increase manufacturing and warranty costs and adversely affect our relationships with our customers 
in addition  because we do not recognize revenue on the sale of an implanter until it is delivered and qualified by the customer  any delay in qualification would result in a delay in our ability to recognize revenue from the sale and receipt of final payment 
historically it has taken approximately nine to eighteen months to build  ship and obtain customer acceptance of our implanters 
our implanters and associated technology are subject to export regulations  which could prevent or delay the sale of such products in foreign countries 
certain technologies associated with our implanters are subject to export regulations administered by the us department of commerce 
accordingly  we may be required to secure us export licenses with respect to sales of implanters or transfers of technologies to end users in certain foreign countries 
this requirement could result in significant delays in  or the prevention of  sales of implanters or transfers of technology or other such technical data to customers in certain foreign countries 
for example  the sale of an ibis implanter and the corresponding transfer of technology to simgui required an export license which took approximately one year to secure 
there can be no assurance that if necessary  we will be able to secure such licenses in the future in a timely manner  or at all 
the loss of key members of our scientific and management staff could delay and may prevent the achievement of our research  development and business objectives 
our chief executive officer  martin j 
reid  and other current officers and key members of our scientific staff are responsible for areas such as product development and improvements  and process improvements research  which are important to our specialized scientific business 
the loss of  and failure to promptly replace  any member of this group could significantly delay and may prevent the achievement of our research  development and business objectives 
while we have entered into an employment agreement with our chief executive officer  under certain circumstances he may be able to terminate his employment with us 
furthermore  although our employees are subject to certain confidentiality and non competition obligations  our key personnel may terminate their employment at any time and may become employed by a competitor 
the current composition of ibis management and of its board of directors is subject to change and should not be unduly relied upon 
we may not be able to successfully produce our products on a large scale 
we have limited manufacturing experience and have only manufactured limited quantities of oxygen implanters 
to be successful  our products must be manufactured in commercial quantities  at acceptable costs 
we may not be able to make the transition to high volume commercial production successfully 
future production in commercial quantities may create technical and financial challenges for us 
any difficulty or delay in constructing additional implanters  if needed  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may not be able to use all of our existing or future manufacturing capacity at a profitable level 
at times we may have the capacity to produce more oxygen implantation machines than we have orders for at such times 
during such idle time we would continue to be responsible for the fixed costs of our facility and maintaining personnel  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may not successfully form or maintain desirable strategic alliances 
we believe we will need to form or maintain alliances with strategic partners for the manufacturing  marketing and distribution of our products 
we may enter into these strategic alliances to satisfy customer demand and to address possible customer concerns regarding our being a sole source supplier 
the limited number of reliable sources of supply other than ibis may adversely affect or delay the integration of simox soi wafers in mainstream commercial applications 
we may not be successful in maintaining alliances or in forming and maintaining other alliances  including satisfying our contractual obligations with our strategic partners  and our partners may not devote adequate resources to manufacture  market and distribute these products successfully or may attempt to compete with us 
we may have difficulty obtaining the materials and components needed to produce our products 
ibis manufactures its oxygen implanters from standard components and from components manufactured in house or by other vendors according to our design specifications 
most raw materials and components not produced by us are available from more than one supplier 
however  certain raw materials  components and subassemblies are obtained from a limited group of suppliers 
semiconductor equipment is a growth industry and is very cyclical in nature  so if our suppliers experience an increase in demand from other semiconductor equipment manufacturers with much higher volumes than us  the lead time and or price for some of our components may increase 
although we have sought to reduce our dependence on these limited source suppliers and we have not experienced significant production delays due to unavailability or delay in procurement of component parts or raw materials to date  increased market demand for materials from  or disruption or termination of  certain of these sources could occur and such increased demand  disruptions  or termination could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we may not be able to protect our patents and proprietary technology 
our ability to compete effectively with other companies will depend  in part  on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology 
although we have been awarded or have filed applications for a number of patents in the us and foreign countries  those patents may not provide meaningful protection  or pending patents may not be issued 
our competitors in both the us and foreign countries  many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies  may have or may obtain patents that will prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to make and sell our products or intentionally infringe on our patents 
the defense and prosecution of patent suits is both costly and time consuming  even if the outcome is favorable to us 
in addition  there is an inherent unpredictability regarding obtaining and enforcing patents 
an adverse outcome in the defense of a patent suit could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties  or require us to cease selling our products 
we also rely in large part on unpatented proprietary technology and others  including strategic partners  may independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our proprietary technology 
to protect our rights in these areas  we currently require all of our employees to enter into confidentiality agreements 
however  these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use  misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information 
others may claim that our technology infringes on their proprietary rights 
any infringement claims  even if without merit  can be time consuming and expensive to defend and may divert management s attention and resources 
if successful  they could also require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements 
a successful claim of product infringement against us and our inability to license the infringed or similar technology could adversely affect our business 
if we do not comply with all applicable environmental regulations  we could be subject to fines and other sanctions 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local environmental regulations related to the storage  treatment  discharge or disposal of chemicals used in our operations and exposure of our personnel to occupational hazards 
although we believe that we have all permits necessary to conduct our business  the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us  suspension of production or a cessation of operations 
our future activities may result in our being subject to additional regulations 
such regulations could require us to acquire significant equipment or to incur other substantial expenses to comply with regulations 
our failure to control the use of  or to restrict adequately the discharge of  hazardous substances or properly control other occupational hazards could subject us to substantial financial liabilities 
our stock price is highly volatile 
the market prices for securities of high tech companies have been volatile 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices for these securities for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the market price for our common stock has fluctuated significantly 
since january   our stock price has fluctuated from a high of to a low of 
it is likely that the market price of our stock will continue to fluctuate in the future 
events or factors that may have a significant impact on our business and on the market price of our common stock include the following quarterly fluctuations in operating results  difficulty in forecasting future results  announcements by us or our present or potential competitors  technological innovations or new commercial products or services by us or our competitors  the timing of receipt of orders from major customers  product mix  product obsolescence  shifts in customer demand  our ability to manufacture and ship products on a cost effective and timely basis  market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our implanters  the evolving and unpredictable nature of the markets for the products incorporating simox soi wafers  the amount of research and development expenses associated with new or enhanced products or implanters the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  and general market conditions 
securities litigation could result in substantial cost and divert the attention of key personnel  which could seriously harm our business

limitations on effectiveness of controls 
the company s management  including the chief executive officer and president and the chief financial officer  does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal controls will prevent all errors and intentional misrepresentations 
a control system  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues  if any  within the company have been detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake 
additionally  controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by management override of the control 
the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and no assurance can be given that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions  over time  controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or intentional conduct may occur and not be detected 
item description of property ibis corporate office and manufacturing facilities are located at two leased facilities in danvers  massachusetts 
previously our business segments were divided between these two facilities  with implantation equipment design and manufacture conducted in one of the facilities and simox wafer production conducted in the other facility 
in connection with our implantation equipment design and manufacturing facility we leased approximately  square feet which includes  square feet for future expansion 
additionally in connection with our simox wafer research facility we leased approximately  square feet which includes a modernized cleanroom that contain implanters  metrology equipment  cleaning equipment and an implantation equipment manufacturing and service area 
the leases expire on may  and december   respectively  and contain an option to renew for five years 
due to our recent exit of the wafer manufacturing business in mid however  we plan to consolidate our operations into one facility during may consequently  we will not be renewing the lease ended may   which will effectively reduce our overall leased space by  square feet leaving  square feet

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of ibis including notes thereto and selected financial data included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview ibis technology corporation ibis was formed in october and commenced operations in january ibis initial activities consisted of producing and selling simox soi wafers and conducting research and development activities 
this effort led to the development of proprietary oxygen implanters  the ibis  which we began selling in  the next generation implanter  the i  which we began selling in  and also to other proprietary process technology 
initially  much of our revenue was derived from research and development contracts and sales of wafers for military applications 
over the years  the company decided to focus its business operations and sales strategy on the manufacture and sale of our implanter equipment products and de emphasized the sale of wafers given that  among other things  we believed that the wafer manufacturing companies were in the best position to manufacture simox soi wafers using our implanter equipment in light of their expertise and operating efficiencies 
as we announced on july   we have exited the wafer manufacturing business 
our wafer business had been highly concentrated on providing wafers for the company s largest customer  and was characterized by very volatile production volumes and costs associated with periodic changes and continuing improvements to the process 
our major wafer customer had tended to order fluctuating quantities of wafers on an irregular basis 
this customer also could revise or cancel orders at any time prior to delivery 
this meant that this customer  who had accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue in the past  could have reduced or decided not to place any orders in the succeeding quarter or quarters 
furthermore  most of our other wafer customers were sampling simox wafers or are in the process of developing prototype products and have also tended to order small quantities of wafers on an irregular basis 
these customers could also revise or cancel orders at any time prior to delivery 
as previously announced  because of this unpredictability  and because it was also likely that additional capital investments would have to be made to keep our wafer manufacturing process up to date among other factors  we decided to discontinue the wafer manufacturing portion of the business in and to focus exclusively on our equipment business 
we will maintain a research and development effort relating to wafers for our equipment improvement programs 
ibis has experienced quarterly and annual fluctuations in revenue and results of operations due to various factors  including i the timing of receipt of equipment orders  and ii dependence on a limited number of customers 
we believe that a migration of soi wafer manufacturing into the major silicon wafer suppliers is taking place 
we reach this conclusion for a number of reasons 
first  we believe that tremendous price pressure exists on commodity type products  such as silicon wafers  and this pressure is already eroding price expectations of soi wafers 
because the starting wafer represents a significant component of the soi wafer cost  we believe that silicon wafer manufacturers should have a natural cost structure advantage leading to a higher gross margin  and therefore should be able to manage such price pressure better than stand alone soi producers that do not also produce the silicon wafer itself 
second  we expect that the price pressure will encourage silicon wafer manufacturers to seek out higher margin products  like soi wafers  to increase their margins 
third  we believe that silicon wafer manufacturers have traditionally developed proprietary intellectual property in silicon materials science  which can be applied to designing optimal starting wafers for soi production 
we believe that this should give them an advantage in both minimizing wafer cost and maximizing soi wafer quality and yield 
fourth  our experience suggests that silicon wafer manufacturers already have a well developed infrastructure for the manufacturing  sale and marketing of large volumes of substrates 
lastly  we believe that there is greater efficiency in producing the soi wafer as part of the wafer manufacturers existing product flow  specifically avoiding the need to repackage  re clean  re inspect and reship substrates twice  once as starting silicon wafers  and a second time as soi wafers 
therefore  as a result of these trends  we expect our ultimate customers will be drawn from these silicon wafer manufacturers and we plan to focus a majority of our technical and marketing resources on the sale of implanters to the leading silicon wafer manufacturers and our key customers in the semiconductor industry who we believe are the leaders in the adoption of soi technology 
we expect that implanter sales to chipmakers should be minimal  and that these sales will be focused on soi processes that the chipmaker wishes to keep proprietary  such as selective or patterned simox  or other specialty substrates 
our fundamental simox soi technology has been developed  refined  and tested over the last dozen years 
in  we introduced the current generation of simox soi technology  which included our second generation oxygen implanter i  and the mld wafer process which was licensed to us by ibm 
we believe that the i s flexibility  automation and operator friendly controls allow this tool to produce a wide range of simox soi wafer products using a range of manufacturing processes  including advantox mld and advantox mld ut wafers 
we also believe the ability of the i implanter to produce eight and twelve inch or and mm simox soi wafers coupled with the mld process positions us to capitalize on the growing soi market 
in  we commenced a program to design and develop the i  introduced it in march and began shipping mm wafers implanted from this machine shortly thereafter 
customers who purchase the i can utilize more than one simox wafer manufacturing process on the implanter including the ibm mld process  when licensed  as well as other simox soi wafer manufacturing processes that do not require the ibm license 
because we have sold only a limited number of implanters to date on an irregular basis  the recognition of revenue from the sale of even one implanter is likely to result in a significant increase in the revenue during that quarter 
we recognize implanter revenue in accordance with sab  which includes  among other criteria  the shipment and factory acceptance of the implanter at the customer s location 
as a result  deferral of revenue will be recorded on our balance sheet until the company is able to meet these criteria 
in january  we announced the booking ie receipt of an order for one ibis i simox implanter from sumco  a leading international silicon wafer manufacturer 
although no assurances can be given  we expect to ship this system in the second quarter of depending on completion of the tool and customer acceptance of the tool at our facility 
revenue recognition for this implanter will be based on final customer acceptance at their facility  the timing of which may vary depending on a number of factors  including performance of the tool 
in july  the company announced its intention to discontinue its wafer manufacturing business 
the company s final disposal plans relative to the closure of the wafer manufacturing operation resulted in a loss from disposal of inventory and certain production assets from discontinued operations of million 
this loss combined with the negative margin incurred by the wafer manufacturing business in of million resulted in the total loss from discontinued operations of million 
wafer product sales  as well as wafer revenue reported in previous quarters  are reported net of associated costs  as loss from discontinued operations on our income statement 
current quarter and all previously reported quarterly and year to date financial information described on the financial statements have been adjusted and reported accordingly 
the company believes that its decision to discontinue the wafer business permit broader strategic collaboration efforts between ibis and the wafer manufacturers 
the company also believes elimination of wafer manufacturing and associated sales at ibis  potentially allows our primary customers the opportunity to supply additional wafer volume with better quality and at lower cost to their end customers 
we believe this has the potential to lead to the placement of additional simox soi equipment orders  and to accelerate customer acceptance of our technology 
during february  we announced the booking ie receipt of an order for one ibis i simox implanter  with an option to purchase a second i  from a leading international silicon wafer manufacturer 
we subsequently achieved customer acceptance of this implanter at our facility and in the second quarter of this system was shipped to the customer s facility 
revenue for this implanter order was recognized in the third quarter of  based on the final acceptance by the customer 
during the fourth quarter ended december   a number of unexpected events occurred that impacted our mm and smaller wafer size production line including the line s projected cash flow generation and our projected utilization of the assets within our revised plans 
based on these events and their impact on current and future projected cash flows  and our subsequent impairment analysis under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  resulted in an impairment charge of million for our mm and smaller simox wafer production line  which was principally comprised of ibis implanters and associated machinery and equipment not expected to be utilized or sold 
the remaining carrying amount of assets for this line was charged to the loss from discontinued operations in the third quarter of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates on matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  inventory valuation and reserves  accounts receivable reserves and the assessment of long lived asset impairment 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
below  we discuss these policies further  as well as the estimates and judgments involved 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from wafer product sales  equipment sales and the sales of spare parts when all of the following criteria have been met evidence exists that the customer is bound to the transaction  the product has been delivered to the customer and  when applicable  the product has been installed and accepted by the customer  the sales price to the customer has been fixed or is determinable  and collectibility of the sale price is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue from implanter sales upon acceptance at the customer s site 
provisions for estimated sales returns and allowances are made at the time the products are sold 
revenue derived from contracts and services is recognized upon performance 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with revenue recognized in any period 
management analyzes various factors  including a review of specific transactions  historical experience  credit worthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions 
changes in judgments based upon these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue and cost recognized 
inventory valuation and reserves 
our policy for the valuation of inventory  including the determination of obsolete or excess inventory  requires us to forecast the future demand for our products within specific time horizons  generally twelve months or less 
if our forecasted demand for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly  we could be required to record additional inventory reserves  which would have a negative impact on our gross margin 
we reserve for obsolescence when engineering changes or other technological advances indicate that obsolescence has occurred 
with the discontinuance of the wafer manufacturing business and the write off of all inventory  the focus is now on the reserves required for equipment part inventory 
accounts receivable reserves 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
the estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on a specific analysis of accounts in the receivable portfolio and a general reserve based on the aging of receivables and historical write off experience 
while management believes the allowance to be adequate  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required and could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
valuation of long lived assets 
ibis reviews the valuation of long lived assets  including property and equipment and licenses  under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
management is required to assess the recoverability of its long lived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
based on current conditions  factors we consider important and that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to book value 
in accordance with sfas no 
 when we determine that the carrying value of applicable long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we evaluate whether the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset 
if such a circumstance exists  we would measure an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount of the particular long lived asset or group exceeds its fair value 
we would determine the fair value based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
we adopted sfas no 
during the first quarter of and during the fourth quarter of we recognized an impairment charge of million for our mm and smaller simox wafer production line

this is in comparison to the discontinued operations loss of million for the year ended december  which was the result of the negative margin for this period 
taxes 
ibis had federal net operating loss and general business credit carryovers of approximately million and million  respectively  at december   that may be used to offset future taxable income  if any  through state net operating loss and credit carryovers of million and million  respectively  have varying expiration dates 
deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance of million related to the net operating loss carryover results from the exercise of employee stock options  the tax benefit of which  when recognized  will be accounted for as a credit to additional paid in capital rather than a reduction of income tax expense 
net operating loss carryovers and other tax attributes may be limited in the event of certain changes in ownership interests 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   ibis had cash and cash equivalents of million  including the full payment of million for the i simox implanter which was recognized as revenue in the third quarter of based on the final acceptance by the customer 
based on the company s final disposal plans relative to the closure of the wafer operation  the company was required to take cash related charges of approximately million 
the company will maintain a wafer research and development effort focused on continuous improvement of the equipment capabilities and for supporting the company s equipment customers needs at what is expected to be at a significantly reduced cost to the business going forward 
as a result  the company expects to reduce its monthly cash burn rate and believes it has sufficient cash for operations through the foreseeable future or at least the next twelve months 
during the fiscal year ended december   ibis used million of cash for operating activities of continuing operations as compared to million in to date  ibis working capital requirements have been funded primarily through debt capital leases and equity financings 
the principal uses of cash during the fiscal year ended december  were to fund operations and additions to property and equipment which totaled million 
at december   ibis had commitments to purchase approximately million in material to be used for the i implanter currently under construction and operating expenses 
as part of our cash management plan we initiated additional cost savings measures during and this included the layoff of twenty nine employees 
in the third quarter of the company announced that it was discontinuing the wafer manufacturing portion of the business 
this resulted in the layoff of an additional seventeen employees 
our headcount for the year ended december  was employees 
in june of  ibis entered into an agreement with a financing agent to obtain payment for products from it s largest customer on an expedited basis 
the discounted rate associated with this agreement was based on the prime rate and may fluctuate 
in september  ibis entered into a million equipment lease line with heller financial s commercial equipment finance group 
the lease line was used to finance the purchase of process equipment for wafer production  primarily mm wafers 
this line was fully drawn down in two sale leaseback transactions  bearing interest at approximately with a term of three years  and a monthly net payment of approximately million 
ibis had a fair market value purchase option at the end of the lease term 
the lease line ended in the third quarter of and the company exercised the fair market value purchase option at the negotiated buyout price of million 
the company intends to use the majority of the equipment to support its ongoing process development efforts and anticipates that it will be able to sell a portion of the equipment purchased for approximately million 
our existing cash resources are believed to be sufficient to support our current operating plan for the next twelve months with the receipt of our latest order in january  which we plan to ship during the second quarter of this expectation however  is based on our current operating plan and general sales outlook  each of which may change rapidly 
we intend to continue to invest in our research  development and manufacturing capabilities 
changes in technology or sales growth beyond currently established capabilities may require further investment 
moreover  although ibis is encouraged by the receipt of an additional order from sumco for an i implanter and the opportunity to work with leading wafer manufacturers like sumco to develop further both the i implanter and to improve the simox process  soi technology is still in an early stage 
further adoption of the technology and timing of future equipment orders are dependent on the continuing qualification of implanters and improvement programs at the device manufacturers  among other factors 
although no assurances can be given  the company expects to ship the system in the second quarter of and collect of the purchase price of the system  or million 
revenue recognition and receipt of the final of the purchase price will be based on final customer acceptance at the customer s facility  which is expected to occur in the third or fourth quarter of this year 
the timing of final acceptance and revenue recognition may vary depending on a number of factors  which include among other things tool performance at the customer site  and no guarantees can be given with respect to whether or when the company will recognize revenue on this transaction 
the timing of future orders is important and difficult to predict because customers can delay orders and or request early shipment  either of which could cause the need for additional cash requirements 
forecasting future revenue  on a quarter by quarter basis  remains exceedingly difficult and significant variations quarter to quarter  are likely 
we expect to continue to explore equity offerings and other forms of financing and anticipate that we may be required to raise additional capital in the future in order to finance future growth and our research and development programs 
there can be no assurance  however  that our actual needs will not exceed expectations or that we will be able to fund our operations on a long term basis in the absence of other sources 
there also can be no assurance that any additional required longer term financing will be available through additional bank borrowings  debt or equity offerings or otherwise  or that if such financing is available  that it will be available on terms acceptable to us 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s k section a ii 
contractual obligations we have no significant contractual obligations not fully recorded on our balance sheets or fully disclosed in the notes to our financial statements 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s k section a ii 
at december   our outstanding contractual obligations included payment due by period total less than year year years years more than years contractual obligations minimum operating lease payments minimum royalty payment obligations total additional information regarding our financial commitments at december  is provided in the notes to our financial statements
