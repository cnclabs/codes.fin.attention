the company and its subsidiaries also occupy premises and utilize equipment under operating leases that expire at various dates through in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the obligations under these operating leases are not recorded on the company s balance sheet 
many of these leases provide for payment of certain expenses and contain renewal and purchase options 
the company has a synthetic lease for printing equipment in the united states which is accounted for as an operating lease 
the equipment under the facility had a fair value of approximately million at the date of inception in may this facility has a term of four years  with expected minimum lease payments remaining of approximately million in and and million in at the end of this facility  the company has the option of purchasing the equipment at the estimated residual value of approximately million

table of contents the operating lease obligations shown in the table have not been reduced by minimum non cancelable sublease rentals aggregating approximately million 
the company remains secondarily liable under these leases in the event that the sub lessee defaults under the sublease terms 
the company does not believe that material payments will be required as a result of the secondary liability provisions of the primary lease agreements 
the operating lease obligations shown in the table include the minimum annual rental commitments related to the year lease entered into in february pertaining to the company s relocation of its primary new york offices currently located at hudson street to water street 
the synthetic lease payments indicated in the table assume that the company would exercise its option to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease for approximately million  which represents the estimated residual value of the equipment at the end of the lease 
unconditional purchase obligations primarily represent commitments for services  and capital expenditures 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has long term liabilities for deferred employee compensation  including pension  supplemental retirement plan  and deferred compensation 
the payments related to the supplemental retirement plan and deferred compensation are not included above since they are dependent upon when the employee retires or leaves the company  and whether the employee elects lump sum or annuity payments

critical accounting policies and estimates the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company s significant accounting polices are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the selection and application of these accounting principles and methods requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as certain financial statement disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to the recognition of revenue under the percentage of completion method of accounting  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets  income tax provision and deferred taxes  restructuring costs  actuarial assumptions for employee benefit plans  and contingent liabilities related to litigation and other claims and assessments 
the company bases its 
table of contents estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
while management believes that the estimates and assumptions it uses in preparing the financial statements are appropriate  these estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties regarding their ultimate outcome  and therefore  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the company has identified its critical accounting policies and estimates below 
these are policies and estimates that the company believes are the most important in portraying the company s financial condition and results  and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
accounting for goodwill and intangible assets two issues arise with respect to these assets that require significant management estimates and judgment a the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation and b the ongoing evaluation for impairment 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas no 
 business combinations  the company allocates the cost of acquired companies to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
certain intangible assets  such as customer relationships  are amortized to expense over time  while in process research and development costs  if any  are recorded as a one time charge at the acquisition date if it is determined that it has no alternative future use 
the company s future operating performance will be impacted by the future amortization of identifiable intangible assets and potential impairment charges related to goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
accordingly  the allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on the company s future operating results 
the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired companies to intangible assets and goodwill requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets and the appropriate discount rate to value these cash flows 
should different conditions prevail  material write downs of net intangible assets and or goodwill could occur 
the company has acquired certain identifiable intangible assets in connection with its acquisitions of mendez in  globalnet and decisionquest in  and tri coastal in these identifiable intangible assets primarily consist of the value associated with customer relationships  trade name  covenants not to compete  software licenses and proprietary technology 
the valuation of these identifiable intangible assets is subjective and requires a great deal of expertise and judgment 
for these reasons  the company has used independent third party valuation firms to value these assets 
the values of the customer relationships were primarily derived using estimates of future cash flows to be generated from the customer relationships 
this approach was used since the inherent value of the customer relationship is its ability to generate current and future income 
the value of the software licenses were derived using the market approach  which is based upon the value of similar or alternative technology 
this approach was used due to the uncertainty regarding the amount of future cash flows to be generated from the software license 
the value of the trade name was determined using an estimated market based royalty rate applied to projected future revenue 
the value of the proprietary technology was based on estimated replacement cost 
the value of the covenant not to compete was determined using a discounted cash flow methodology 
while different amounts would have been reported using different methods or using different assumptions  the company believes that the methods selected and the assumptions used are the most appropriate for each asset analyzed 
statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets requires annual impairment testing of goodwill based upon the estimated fair value of the company s reporting units 
at december   our goodwill balance was  which primarily related to the globalization segment  and the litigation solutions business 
in testing for potential impairment of goodwill  sfas requires the company to allocate goodwill to the reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates  estimate the fair value of those reporting units 
table of contents to which goodwill relates  and determine the carrying value book value of those reporting units 
furthermore  if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value for a particular reporting unit  then we are required to estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business 
only after this process is completed is the amount of goodwill impairment determined 
accordingly  the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
for impairment testing purposes  the company has utilized the services of independent consultants to perform valuations of the company s reporting units that contained significant balances of goodwill 
the fair value of the company s reporting units was estimated based on discounted expected future cash flows using a weighted average cost of capital rate 
additionally  an assumed terminal growth rate was used to project future cash flows beyond base years 
the estimates and assumptions regarding expected cash flows  terminal growth rates and the discount rate require considerable judgment and are based upon historical experience  financial forecasts  and industry trends and conditions 
these assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying business 
based on our estimates  the company has concluded that there is no impairment of goodwill 
however  a decline in expected cash flows or the estimated terminal value could cause reporting units to be valued differently 
if the reporting units do not meet projected operating results  then this analysis could potentially result in a non cash goodwill impairment charge  depending on the estimated value of the company s reporting units 
additionally  an increase in the assumed discount rate weighted average cost of capital could also result in goodwill impairment 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue for substantially all services within its financial print segment and litigations solutions business when products or services are delivered to customers or when completed 
revenue for services provided within the company s globalization segment are recognized under the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenues and costs 
the company follows this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various elements of the contract can be made 
since the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates  which are assessed continually during the term of these contracts  recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses toward completion 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the provision become known 
the company believes these revenue recognition methods best represent when the company has earned revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company realizes that it will be unable to collect all amounts that it bills to its customers 
therefore  it estimates the amount of billed receivables that it will be unable to collect and provides an allowance for doubtful accounts during each accounting period 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables 
the company s estimates are based on  among other things  the aging of its account receivables  its past experience collecting receivables  information about the ability of individual customers to pay  and current economic conditions 
while such estimates have been within our expectations and the provisions established  a change in financial condition of specific customers or in overall trends experienced may result in future adjustments of our estimates of recoverability of our receivables 
as of december   the company had an allowance for doubtful accounts of  accounting for income taxes accounting for taxes requires significant judgments in the development of estimates used in income tax calculations 
such judgments include  but are not limited to  the likelihood the company would realize the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards  the adequacy of valuation allowances  and the rates used to measure transactions with foreign subsidiaries 
as part of the process of preparing the company s financial statements  the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
the judgments and estimates used are subject to challenge by domestic and foreign taxing authorities 
it is possible that either domestic or foreign taxing authorities could challenge those judgments and estimates and draw conclusions that would cause the company to incur liabilities in excess of those currently recorded 
the company uses an estimate of its annual effective tax rate 
table of contents at each interim period based upon the facts and circumstances available at that time  while the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year end 
changes in the geographical mix or estimated amount of annual pre tax income could impact the company s overall effective tax rate 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at december  and  the company had deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of  and  respectively 
at december  and  management determined that it is more likely than not that  and  respectively  of such assets will be realized  resulting in a valuation allowance of  and  respectively 
the company evaluates quarterly the realization of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the primary factor used to assess the likelihood of realization is the company s forecast of future taxable income 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented 
accounting for pensions the company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan in the us the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plan in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires that expenses and liabilities recognized in financial statements be actuarially calculated 
under these accounting standards  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the future performance of plan assets 
delayed recognition of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results is a guiding principle of these standards 
this delayed recognition of actual results allows for a smoothed recognition of changes in benefit obligations and plan performance over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plan 
the primary assumptions used in calculating pension expense and liability are related to the discount rate at which the future obligations are discounted to value the liability  expected rate of return on plan assets  and projected salary increases 
these rates are estimated annually as of december the discount rate assumption is tied to a long term high quality bond index and is therefore subject to annual fluctuations 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of the pension obligations  which results in higher pension expense 
the discount rate was at december   compared to at december  and at december  the percent at december  was used to calculate the pension expense 
each percentage point change in the discount rate would result in an million change in the projected pension benefit obligation and a million change in pension expense 
the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption is based on the long term expected returns for the investment mix of assets currently in the portfolio 
management uses historic return trends of the asset portfolio combined with anticipated future market conditions to estimate the rate of return 
from to  the company had been using an expected return on plan assets assumption of  which was consistent with the long term asset returns of the portfolio 
in  management lowered the expected rate of return assumption to  and during lowered it again to due to the expected lower future performance of the us equity markets 
each percentage point change in the assumed long term rate of return would result in a million change in pension expense 

table of contents the projected salary increase assumption is based upon historical trends and comparisons of the external market 
higher rates of increase result in higher pension expenses 
as this rate is also a long term expected rate  it is less likely to change on an annual basis 
management has used the rate of for the past three years 
restructuring accrual during fiscal   and  the company recorded significant restructuring charges 
prior to the fourth quarter of  these costs were accrued in accordance with eitf liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
during the fourth quarter of  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  whereas under eitf  the liability was recognized at the commitment date to an exit plan 
as a component of the restructuring charge of  the company recorded an expense related to facility closures and lease termination costs totaling  the recorded amount was based on the fair value of contractual obligations contained in the leases net of estimated sublease income discounted using a credit adjusted risk free rate 
this expense was recorded using our estimates of future expected cash flows associated with these office closings 
the liability associated with the facility closures will be adjusted for revisions related to the timing and amount of estimated cash flows in the period they become known 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas revised  share based payment sfas r which replaces sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
among other items  sfas r eliminates the use of apb and the intrinsic method of accounting  and requires all share based payments  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
sfas r is effective for public companies beginning with the first interim period that begins after june  the company will adopt sfas r in and in accordance with its provisions will recognize compensation expense for all share based payments and employee stock options based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of the statement on its financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position  fsp fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of 
in fsp fas  the fasb concluded that the tax relief special tax deduction for domestic manufacturing from this legislation should be accounted for as a special deduction instead of a tax rate reduction 
the guidance in fsp fas was effective december  and had no impact on the company s results of operations or its financial position 
in december  the fasb issued fsp fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of 
the american jobs creation act of introduces a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer repatriation provision  provided certain criteria are met 
fsp fas gives a company additional time to evaluate the effects of the legislation on any plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the deduction is subject to a number of limitations  and uncertainty remains as to how to interpret numerous provisions in the act 
as such  the company is not in a position to decide on whether  and to what extent  it might repatriate foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the us based on its analysis to date 
the company therefore cannot reasonably estimate the income tax effect of such repatriation 
the company expects to be in a position to finalize its assessment by december  in september  the emerging issues task force eitf of the fasb reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share  which requires the shares issuable under contingently convertible debt  such as the company s convertible 
table of contents subordinated debentures  to be included in diluted earnings per share computations  regardless of whether the contingency had been met  if the effect would be dilutive to the earnings per share calculation 
the provisions are effective for reporting periods ending after december  if the impact is dilutive  all prior period earnings per share amounts presented are required to be restated to conform to the provisions of the eitf 
the company adopted this rule during the fourth quarter of and there was no effect on diluted income loss per share for all periods presented since the effect was anti dilutive to the earnings per share calculation 
in future periods the effect of this rule  if the impact is dilutive  would be to increase the average shares outstanding used in the calculation of diluted earnings per share by the amount of the shares issuable under the company s convertible subordinated debentures  shares for the year ended december  and increase the numerator used in the calculation of diluted earnings per share by an amount equal to interest cost  net of tax  on the convertible subordinated debentures approximately  for the year ended december  
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  and amended the interpretation with fin r in december this interpretation and its amendment set forth a requirement for an investor with a majority of the variable interests in a variable interest entity vie to consolidate the entity and also requires majority and significant variable interest investors to provide certain disclosures 
a vie is an entity in which the equity investors do not have a controlling interest  or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from the other parties 
the provisions of fin were effective immediately for all arrangements entered into with new vies created after january  the company has not entered into any arrangements with vies after january  for arrangements entered into with vies created prior to january   the provisions of fin were adopted by the company as of march   the impact of such adoption did not have an effect on the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s market risk is principally associated with trends in the domestic and international capital markets  particularly in the financial print segment 
this includes trends in the initial public offerings and mergers and acquisitions markets  both important components of the financial print segment 
the company also has market risk tied to interest rate fluctuations related to its debt obligations and fluctuations in foreign currency  as discussed below 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its short term investment portfolio  long term debt obligations  revolving credit agreement and synthetic lease agreement 
the company does not use derivative instruments in its short term investment portfolio 
the company s debentures issued in september consist of fixed rate instruments  and therefore  would not be impacted by changes in interest rates 
the debentures have a fixed interest rate of 
amounts borrowed under the three year million revolving credit facility that was completed in july and amended in march and september  with the facility reduced to million in october bear interest at libor plus basis points or an alternative base rate greater of federal funds rate plus basis points or the prime rate depending on certain leverage ratios 
during the year ended december   the average interest rate on this line of credit approximated 
a hypothetical change in the annual interest rate of per annum would result in a change in annual interest expense of approximately thousand  based on the average outstanding balances under the revolving credit facility during the year ended december  foreign exchange rates the company derives a portion of its revenues from various foreign sources 
the company s globalization segment is impacted by foreign currency fluctuations since its labor costs are predominantly denominated in foreign currencies  while a significant portion of its revenue is denominated in us dollars 
this is somewhat mitigated by the fact that revenue from the company s international financial print 
table of contents operations is denominated in foreign currencies  while some of its costs are denominated in us dollars 
to date  the company has not used foreign currency hedging instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations 
the company has reflected translation income of   and  in its consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss included in stockholders equity for the years ended december   and  respectively 
this income is primarily attributed to the fluctuation in value between the us dollar and the euro  pound sterling and canadian dollar 
equity price risk the company s investments in marketable equity securities consist primarily of auction rate securities 
these securities are fixed income securities with minimal market fluctuation risk 
the company s defined benefit pension plan holds investments in both equity and fixed income securities 
the amount of the company s annual contribution to the plan is dependent upon  among other things  the return on the plan s assets 
to the extent there are fluctuations in equity values  the amount of the company s annual contribution could be affected 
for example  a decrease in equity prices could increase the amount of the company s annual contributions to the plan
