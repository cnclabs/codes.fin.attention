during financing activities provided  in cash 
borrowings on term loans for acquisitions was  and on lines of credit  net of repayments  was  in addition   of cash was provided by proceeds from issuing  shares of unregistered restricted common stock under the terms of a stock purchase agreement 
the purchasers of these shares were certain trusts and pension plans  the beneficiaries of which are michel robert  a consultant to the company  and members of his immediate family 
the aggregate purchase price for the shares represented the fair value of the stock at the time the company received the purchase price 
cash was also provided from stock transactions under various employee benefit stock plans of  and repayment on a loan to the company s employee stock ownership plan of  the cash provided was offset by repayments on term loans of  and on capital leases of at december   the company had  of debt obligations representing borrowings on lines of credit  term loans and an overdraft facility

the line of credit expires in may  unless extended 
under the agreement  the company utilizes lock box arrangements whereby remittances from customers reduce the outstanding debt  therefore the line of credit balance has been classified as a current liability 
borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at a rate equal to the banks prime rates plus as of december  under the foreign line of credit agreement foreign agreement  the company has available the lesser of a eur million  or b of eligible trade accounts receivable of premotec as defined in the foreign agreement 
the line of credit expires in august  unless extended

if additional capital is needed in the future  the company would pursue additional capital via debt or equity financings 
a key component of the company s liquidity relates to the availability of amounts under its lines of credit 
any lack of availability of these facilities could have a material adverse impact on the company s liquidity position 
price levels and the impact of inflation prices of the company s products have not increased significantly as a result of inflation during the past several years  primarily due to competition 
the effect of inflation on the company s costs of production has been minimized through production efficiencies  lower costs of materials and surcharges passed on to customers 
the company anticipates that these factors will continue to minimize the effects of any foreseeable inflation and other price pressures from the industries in which it operates 
as the company s manufacturing activities mainly utilize semi skilled labor  which is relatively plentiful in the areas surrounding the company s production facilities  the company does not anticipate substantial inflation related increases in the wages of the majority of its employees 
critical accounting policies the company has prepared its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and these statements necessarily include some amounts that are based on informed judgments and estimates of management 
the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the policies are reviewed on a regular basis 
the company s critical accounting policies are subject to judgments and uncertainties which affect the application of such policies 
the company uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments and estimates 
as discussed below the company s financial position or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
the company s critical accounting policies include the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the allowance is based on historical experience and judgments based on current economic and customer specific factors 
significant judgments are made by management in connection with establishing the company s customers ability to pay at the time of shipment 
despite this assessment  from time to time  the company s customers are unable to meet their payment obligations 
the company continues to monitor customers credit worthiness  and use judgment in establishing the estimated amounts of customer receivables which may not be collected 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of the company s customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of accounts receivable and future operating results 
inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
the company monitors and forecasts expected inventory needs based on sales forecasts 
inventory is written down or written off when it becomes obsolete or when it is deemed excess 
these determinations involve the exercise of significant judgment by management 
if actual market conditions are significantly different from those projected by management the recorded reserve may be adjusted  and such adjustments may have a significant impact on the company s results of operations 
demand for the company s products can fluctuate significantly  and in the past the company has recorded substantial charges for inventory obsolescence 
the company records deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements  and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
realization of the recorded deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate tax jurisdiction in future years to obtain benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences and from tax credit and operating loss carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided to the extent that management deems it more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income are changed 
the company reviews the carrying values of its long lived assets  including goodwill and identifiable intangibles  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be fully recoverable 
under previous standards  the assets had to be carried at historical cost if the projected cash flows from their use would recover their carrying amounts on an undiscounted basis and without considering interest 
however  if projected cash flows were less than their carrying value  the long lived assets had to be reduced to their estimated fair value 
considerable judgment was and is required to project such cash flows and  if required  estimate the fair value of the impaired long lived asset 
effective july   the company adopted sfas no 
sfas no 
provides a more restrictive fair value test to evaluate goodwill and long lived asset impairment 
depending upon future assessments of fair value  there could be impairment recorded related to goodwill and other long lived assets 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
sfas r is a revision of fasb statement no 
accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
the amount of compensation cost will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the provisions of this statement will become effective in our third quarter commencing on july  sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we have not determined the method we will use when we adopt sfas r 
as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method may have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position or cash flows 
the impact of the adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted with certainty at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption and we have not assessed the impact of this provision in the context of our net operating loss carryforwards

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
the company is exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the united states dollar 
these exposures are directly related to its normal operating and funding activities 
interest rate risk the interest payable on the company s domestic and foreign lines of credit and its foreign term loan are variable based on the prime rate and euribor  and are effected by changes in market interest rates 
the company does not believe that reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates will result in a material effect on future earnings  fair values or cash flows of the company 
a change in the interest rate of on the company s variable rate debt would have the impact of changing interest expense by approximately  annually 
foreign currency risk on august   the company completed the acquisition of premotec  located in the netherlands 
sales from this operation are denominated in euros  thereby creating exposures to changes in exchange rates 
the changes in the euro us exchange rate may positively or negatively affect the company s sales  gross margins  net income and retained earnings 
the company does not believe that reasonably possible near term changes in exchange rates will result in a material effect on future earnings  fair values or cash flows of the company
