item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an emerging pharmaceutical company that discovers  develops and seeks to commercialize proprietary pharmaceuticals 
we have devoted substantially all of our efforts towards the research and development of our product candidates 
since our inception  we have had no revenue from product sales and have funded our operations through the sale of equity securities  debt financings  license fees  research and development funding and milestone payments from our collaborative partners 
we have never been profitable and have incurred an accumulated deficit of million as of december  research  development and commercialization expenses relating to our product candidates and to enhancing our core technologies will continue to increase in the near term and may vary significantly from our current estimates 
in particular  we expect to incur increased costs during the first quarter of as we seek regulatory approval for bidil  our lead product in development for the treatment of african americans diagnosed with heart failure 
bidil is an orally administered nitric oxide enhancing medicine  which combines isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine 
we recently concluded a phase iii confirmatory clinical trial of bidil which was designed to evaluate the efficacy of bidil  when taken daily in addition to current heart failure therapies 
the trial demonstrated that african american patients with heart failure experienced a improvement in survival after taking bidil in addition to standard heart failure therapies  as compared to patients in a placebo group who received only standard heart failure therapies 
in july  following the recommendation of the independent data and safety monitoring board and the clinical trial s steering committee  we halted this clinical trial because of the significant survival benefit seen in the preliminary trial results for patients taking the drug 
on december   we resubmitted a new drug application for bidil to the fda 
on february   the fda accepted our new drug application resubmission as a complete class resubmission  which means that under the prescription drug user fee act  fda review of our resubmission is expected to be completed within six months of the date the resubmission was received  or june  general and administrative costs will increase as we prepare for the potential commercialization of bidil in as a result of our decision to halt the bidil trial and resubmit a new drug application to the fda earlier than initially planned  we expect to incur operating expenses in excess of our previous estimates relating to the development of our sales and marketing capabilities  pre launch related expenses and manufacturing costs in connection with the procurement of commercial supplies of bidil 
in addition  we currently estimate that our existing cash and marketable securities will be sufficient to support our operating plan  including increased operating expenses in preparation for the potential launch of bidil  for at least the next eighteen months 
we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability 
at the present time we are unable to estimate the level of revenues  if any  that we will realize from the commercialization of our product candidates  including bidil 
we are therefore unable to estimate when we will achieve profitability  if at all 
on july   the market regulation department of the national association of securities dealers  inc advised us that it initiated a review of trading activity in our common stock surrounding our july  announcement that we had halted our phase iii confirmatory clinical trial of bidil due to the significant survival benefit seen with bidil 
the nasd is reviewing  among other things  information on relationships between our officers  directors and service providers and individuals and institutions who may have traded in our common stock prior to the july  announcement 
we have cooperated with this review and have identified certain persons on the list provided to us by the nasd as having a relationship with our chief executive officer and others at nitromed 
we have established a special committee of our board of directors to oversee our response to this review 
financial operations overview revenue 
we have not generated any revenue from product sales since our inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products until all of our revenue to date has been derived from license fees  research and development payments and milestone payments that we have received from our corporate collaborators 
in future years  we will seek to generate revenue from a combination of product sales  up front fees and milestone payments in connection with collaborative or strategic relationships  and royalties resulting from the license of our intellectual property 
we expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of research and development  milestone and other payments received under our collaborative or strategic relationships and related continuing obligations  and the amount and timing of payments we receive upon the sale of our products  to the extent any are successfully commercialized 
research and development 
research and development expense consists of expenses incurred in identifying  developing and testing product candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  fees paid to professional service providers for independent monitoring and analysis of our clinical trials  costs of contract research and manufacturing  costs of facilities and the legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property 
we expense research and development costs  including patent related costs  as incurred 
the following summarizes our primary research and development programs 
we have not provided program costs since inception because prior to we did not track and accumulate cost information by research program 
bidil 
from may to july  we enrolled  patients at clinical sites in the united states in our phase iii confirmatory clinical trial for bidil 
we halted the trial in july due to a significant survival benefit in the preliminary data for patients taking bidil 
we resubmitted a new drug application for bidil to the fda in december and the fda accepted such resubmission on february  we expect to incur significant additional expenditures for bidil as we apply for regulatory approval  expand our operations  hire additional personnel and  if fda approval is obtained  seek to launch bidil in we estimate that the total direct cost for this trial will be at least million 
however  the actual total cost of the clinical trial  including any costs associated with the ongoing monitoring of patients and any costs incident to our expected launch of the drug  depends on a number of factors  including potential unanticipated delays in the fda s review of our new drug application resubmission and other uncertainties relating to the regulatory approval process 
we do not anticipate receiving revenue from bidil until  if ever 
our failure to commercialize bidil on a timely basis would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
nitric oxide stents 
we are currently working with boston scientific to develop stents coated with a bio compatible polymer that is capable of releasing nitric oxide 
this program is in pre clinical development 
we expect that additional expenditures will be required to conduct pre clinical testing and  if such pre clinical testing is successful  to apply for and conduct clinical trials 
because this program is in pre clinical development  the successful development of products based upon this program is highly uncertain 
as such  we are unable to estimate the cost to complete the research and development phase  nor are we able to estimate the timing of bringing potential candidates to market and  therefore  when material cash inflows from milestones and royalties could commence 
our failure  or our partner s failure  to commercialize products based upon this program on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
nitric oxide enhancing cox inhibitors 
we established a collaboration with merck to screen proprietary nitric oxide enhanced cox inhibitors in advance of clinical testing as analgesic and anti inflammatory agents and in other specified disease areas 
these agents are intended to be second generation cox inhibitors 
on september   merck halted the phase ii trial of our lead candidate in nitric oxide enhancing cox inhibitors 
in november  we agreed with merck to terminate the collaboration agreement 
merck paid us a lump sum of million  representing the full amount of the research funding owed to us for and is not required to provide us with any further funding 
we retain all rights to our technology in the field of nitric oxide enhancing cox inhibitors and intend to evaluate the continued development of this technology in collaboration with other potential partners 
significant additional expenditures will be required to conduct pre clinical testing and to apply for and conduct clinical trials 
because these agents are in pre clinical development  their successful development is highly uncertain 
as such  we are unable to estimate the cost to complete the research and development phase  nor are we able to estimate the timing of bringing potential candidates to market and  therefore  when material cash inflows from milestones and royalties could commence 
our failure  or any future partner s failure  to commercialize these product candidates under development on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
other discovery research 
we are also currently utilizing our nitric oxide expertise to develop products for additional medical conditions 
our efforts in these areas consist of discovery stage research primarily directed to establishing our intellectual property position 
we expect that additional expenditures will be required to conduct pre clinical testing and  if such pre clinical testing is successful  to apply for and conduct clinical trials for any such programs 
because these programs are in pre clinical development  the successful development of products based upon these programs is highly uncertain 
as such  we are unable to estimate the cost to complete research and development  nor are we able to estimate the timing of bringing potential product candidates to market and  therefore  when material cash inflows from milestones and royalties could commence 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  investor relations  accounting  business development  sales and marketing  and human resource functions 
other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expense and professional fees for legal and accounting services 
we have incurred  and will continue to incur  increased general and administrative expense for investor relations and other activities associated with operating as a publicly traded company 
these increases will include the hiring of additional personnel 
we intend to continue to incur increased internal and external business development costs to support our various product development efforts  which can vary from period to period 
during  we also anticipate incurring significant increased expenses in connection with the potential commercial introduction of bidil 
non operating income expense 
interest income includes interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
rental income was derived from a sublease of a portion of our facilities in boston scientific collaboration 
in november  we entered into a development and license agreement with boston scientific to develop cardiovascular stents coated with nitric oxide releasing compounds 
we have granted boston scientific an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize products for restenosis incorporating two nitric oxide releasing compounds 
in consideration of this license  boston scientific made an upfront non refundable license payment of million  which is being recognized over the estimated time period of our contractual obligation to provide research and development services 
in the event that specified research  development and commercialization milestones are achieved  boston scientific is obligated to make milestone payments to us 
boston scientific is also obligated to pay royalties to us on the sale of any products resulting from the collaboration 
in december  we agreed to extend the research and development collaboration through december  and we received an additional million  which is being recognized ratably over the research and development collaboration term 
boston scientific made a million equity investment in our stock in and made an additional  equity investment in our stock in august merck collaboration 
in december  we entered into an exclusive  worldwide research  collaboration and licensing agreement that granted merck marketing and sales rights for nitric oxide enhancing cox inhibitors 
the research portion of the agreement was for three years and could have been extended by mutual agreement 
in  we received an upfront non refundable license payment of million and two payments  each of million  for achieving the first two milestones 
the license fee revenue and the revenue from the first million milestone payment were being recognized over the contractual term of the research and development program  which was to end december  the revenue from the second million payment was recognized in the fourth quarter of  the period in which merck achieved the milestone 
on september   merck halted the phase ii trial of our lead candidate in nitric oxide enhancing cox inhibitors 
this lead nitric oxide candidate is composed of a derivative of rofecoxib 
rofecoxib is the active ingredient in vioxx  a cox inhibitor which merck voluntarily withdrew from worldwide markets on september  in november  we agreed with merck to terminate the collaboration agreement 
merck paid us a lump sum of million  representing the full amount of the research funding owed to us for however  we will not receive any commercialization milestones or royalty payments from merck 
as a result of the termination of this agreement  we accelerated the recognition of deferred license revenue of million in the fourth quarter of  and we recognized the lump sum payment of million as revenue in the fourth quarter of results of operations years ended december   and revenue 
revenue for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in and  in the million  or increase in revenue in compared to is primarily attributable to our collaboration agreement with merck  which was terminated in november in we recognized million in revenue under this agreement  which included all amounts previously deferred 
due to the termination of this collaboration agreement  we no longer have any future performance obligations  and accordingly  we recognized previously deferred license revenue of million 
in addition  we recognized million that was originally scheduled to be paid to us during for research and development funding  but was instead paid to us in when the agreement was terminated 
we also recognized an additional million in revenue for over relating to the december extension of our agreement with boston scientific 
revenue for the year ended december  was million  compared to  in the million  or increase in revenue in compared to was attributable to our collaboration agreement with merck  which we entered into in december during we received million of payments from merck that were deferred and were to be recognized as revenue ratably over the contractual research and development term 
in addition we recognized revenue in for a million milestone when merck advanced a lead nitric oxide enhancing cox inhibitor into human testing and million of research and development funding 
research and development 
research and development expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in and million in the million  or increase in research and development expenses in compared with  is primarily the result of an additional million of expenses associated with the bidil trial  including costs associated with the halt of the trial  ongoing clinical trial related expenses  and the preparation and resubmission of a new drug application with the fda 
we also incurred increased research and development expenses in of million related to compensation related expenses due to additional headcount and non cash stock based compensation related expense  million related to preparation of contract manufacturing capabilities relating to the potential bidil product line  million pertaining to milestone payments under a collaboration and license agreement for bidil  increased outside consulting costs of million  and additional supplies costs of million 
research and development expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in the million  or increase in research and development expenses in compared with  was primarily the result of an additional million of expenses associated with the bidil trial  reflecting the addition of new sites and additional patients and an additional million of compensation related expenses due to additional headcount and non cash stock based compensation related expenses 
the following table summarizes the primary components of our research and development expense for our principal research and development programs for the fiscal years ended december   and december  research and development program bidil    nitric oxide enhancing cox inhibitors   nitric oxide stents    other    total research and development expense   general and administrative 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in and million in the million  or increase in general and administrative expense in compared to was primarily due to million for the preparation for the potential launch of bidil  including costs relating to the hiring of contract sales personnel  hiring of sales and marketing management personnel  public relations services  and advertising and promotion services 
we also incurred higher general and administrative expense in due to increased costs of million associated with the accrual of business development and milestone payment expenses pertaining to the approval process for bidil  million pertaining to additional legal and consulting expenses  million related to the hiring of executive management and additional administrative personnel  an increase in insurance costs of 
million due to operating as a public company  and higher infrastructure related growth of 
million  including moving to a new facility 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in the  or increase in general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily due to the fact that during the year ended december   we incurred additional costs in connection with evaluating and developing plans to commercialize bidil of  and public company reporting related costs of  non operating income expense 
non operating income expense increased to million in compared to  in and  in the  or increase in non operating income expense in compared to was primarily related to higher average fund balances available for investment and higher interest rates due to investing in longer maturity securities 
the  or decrease in non operating income expense in compared to was primarily related to lower rental income due to our sublease agreement ending at our previous facility 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception through the sale of equity  debt and payments from collaborative partners for licenses  research and development and achievement of milestones 
as of december   we have received net proceeds of million from the issuance of equity securities  primarily as the result of the sale of of our redeemable convertible preferred stock  net proceeds of million from our initial public offering in november  and net proceeds of million from our follow on public offering in december  which is described below 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
in december  we closed a follow on public offering of our common stock at a price to the public of per share 
we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock resulting in gross proceeds of million 
in connection with the offering we paid approximately million in underwriting discounts and commissions and incurred 
million in other offering expenses 
after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses  we received net proceeds from the offering of approximately million 
in november  we closed our initial public offering of our common stock at a price to the public of per share 
we sold  shares of our common stock resulting in gross proceeds of million 
in connection with the offering  we paid approximately million in underwriting discounts and commissions and incurred million in other offering expenses 
after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses  we received net proceeds from the offering of approximately million 
in august  we sold  shares of our series e redeemable convertible preferred stock for net proceeds of million to existing preferred stockholders 
these shares contained a beneficial conversion feature based on the fair value of our common stock at the date of such sale compared to the series e redeemable convertible preferred stock share price 
the total value of the beneficial conversion feature of approximately million was recognized as a dividend in the three month period ended september  in addition  we recognized a dividend of approximately million in the three month period ended december  as a result of an increase to the conversion ratio of the series e redeemable convertible preferred stock in connection with our initial public offering in november during the year ended december   operating activities used cash of million primarily due to a net loss of million  a decrease in deferred revenue of million  and an increase in prepaid and other current assets of million  offset by adjustments for non cash charges for stock based compensation and depreciation and amortization of million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
the decrease in deferred revenue was partially due to the termination of the collaboration agreement with merck resulting in the recognition of million of deferred license revenue 
during the year ended december   investing activities used cash of million due to the net purchase of marketable securities of million and purchases of computer and lab equipment of million due to an increase in personnel and the build out for our new facility 
we expect to invest approximately to million for capital expenditures in  principally related to the purchase of laboratory equipment and computer equipment to support headcount growth 
during the year ended december   financing activities provided cash of million primarily as a result of the sale of common stock in a follow on public offering which yielded net proceeds of million 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year years years more than five years operating lease obligation    purchase obligations    total contractual cash obligations   on october   we entered into an agreement with publicis  a contract sales organization  pursuant to which  on our behalf  publicis has employed and is training a specialty sales force of sales representatives to sell bidil to our target prescriber markets  assuming bidil is approved by the fda 
the agreement is for a term of months  with our option to continue the agreement beyond this term 
estimated year one costs are  excluding one time start up costs  and year two costs are projected at  we have the right to terminate this agreement upon days written notice to publicis 
if we terminate this agreement during months one through twelve of the term of the agreement  we are required to pay a termination fee in the amount of million 
if we terminate this agreement during months thirteen through eighteen  the termination fee will be  if we terminate the agreement after month eighteen  no termination fee will be assessed 
on november   we entered into a purchase order for hydralazine with flavine  the us representative of sumitomo 
 remains outstanding on the purchase order as of december  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our planned operations  including increases in spending for our bidil clinical program  for at least eighteen months from the date of this report 
however  we may require significant additional funds earlier than we currently expect to obtain regulatory approvals necessary to launch bidil  and to develop our other product candidates 
we may seek additional funding through collaborative arrangements and public or private financings 
additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
in addition  the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders 
for example  if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  further dilution to our existing stockholders may result 
if we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis  we may be required to significantly curtail one or more of our research or development programs 
we also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies  product candidates  or products which we would otherwise pursue on our own 
even if we are able to raise additional funds in a timely manner  our future capital requirements may vary from what we expect and will depend on many factors  including the following the costs of launching bidil  if and when it is approved by regulatory authorities  the timing  receipt  and amount of milestone and other payments  if any  from collaborators  the timing  receipt  and amount of sales and royalties  if any  from our potential product candidates  the resources required to successfully complete our clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  continued progress in our research and development programs  as well as the magnitude of these programs  the cost of manufacturing  marketing and sales activities  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  and enforcing patent claims  the cost of obtaining and maintaining licenses to use patented technologies  and our ability to establish and maintain additional collaborative arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue  accrued expenses and the factors used to determine the fair value assigned to our stock options 
we base our estimates on historical experience  known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue 
we record revenue on an accrual basis as it is earned and when amounts are considered collectible 
revenues received in advance of performance obligations or in cases where we have a continuing obligation to perform services  are deferred and recognized over the contractual or estimated performance period 
revenues from milestone payments that represent the culmination of a separate earnings process are recorded when the milestone is achieved 
contract revenues are recorded as the services are performed 
when we are required to defer revenue  the period over which such revenue should be recognized is subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the collaborative agreement 
accrued expenses 
as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services which have been performed on our behalf  and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of estimated expenses for which we accrue include contract service fees such as amounts paid to clinical monitors  data management organizations and investigators in conjunction with clinical trials  fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical materials  marketing service fees and professional service fees  such as lawyers and accountants 
in connection with such service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual levels of services incurred by such service providers 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs  which have begun to be incurred  or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often determined based on subjective judgments 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
stock based compensation 
we have elected to follow accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and related interpretations  in accounting for our stock based compensation plans  rather than the alternative fair value method provided for under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or fas in and  certain grants of stock options were made at exercise prices less than the fair value of our common stock and  as a result  we recorded deferred stock compensation expense 
in the notes to our financial statements  we provide pro forma disclosures in accordance with fas we account for transactions in which services are received from non employees in exchange for equity instruments based on the fair value of such services received or of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measured  in accordance with fas and the emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  or eitf accounting for equity instruments granted or sold by us under apb  fas and eitf requires fair value estimates of the equity instrument granted or sold 
if our estimates of the fair value of these equity instruments are too high or too low  our expenses may be over or under stated 
for equity instruments granted or sold in exchange for the receipt of goods or services  we estimate the fair value of the equity instruments based upon consideration of factors which we deem to be relevant at that time 
because shares of our common stock were not publicly traded prior to the commencement of our public offering on november   market factors historically considered in valuing stock and stock option grants include comparative values of public companies discounted for the risk and limited liquidity provided for in the shares we are issuing  pricing of private sales of our redeemable convertible preferred stock  prior valuations of stock grants and the effect of events that have occurred between the time of such grants  economic trends  and the comparative rights and preferences of the security being granted compared to the rights and preferences of our other outstanding equity 
prior to our initial public offering  the fair value of our common stock was determined by our board of directors contemporaneously with the grant 
in the absence of a public trading market for our common stock  our board of directors considered numerous objective and subjective factors in determining the fair value of our common stock 
at the time of option grants and other stock issuances  our board of directors considered the liquidation preferences  dividend rights  voting control and anti dilution protection attributable to our then outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock  the status of private and public financial markets  valuations of comparable private and public companies  the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event such as an initial public offering  our existing financial resources  our anticipated continuing operating losses and increased spending levels required to complete our clinical trials  dilution to common stockholders from anticipated future financings and a general assessment of future business risks 
inflation we believe the effects of inflation generally do not have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements 
recently issued accounting pronouncement on december   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
revised  referred to as fas r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
fas r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in fas r is similar to the approach described in sfas  detailed below 
however  fas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values at the date of grant 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
fas r must be adopted in fiscal periods beginning after june  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we expect to adopt fas r on july   the commencement of our third quarter of fiscal fas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods 
a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of fas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of fas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we have yet to determine which method to use in adopting fas r 
as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of fas r s fair value method may have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of fas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted fas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss and net loss per share in note to our financial statements 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of fas r on our financial position and results of operations  including the valuation methods and support for the assumptions that underlie the valuation of the awards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
our current investment policy is to maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of us money market and high grade corporate and us government related securities  directly or through managed funds  with maturities of two years or less 
our cash is deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in north america 
our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   we estimate that the fair value of our investment portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a change in market interest rates on our investments
