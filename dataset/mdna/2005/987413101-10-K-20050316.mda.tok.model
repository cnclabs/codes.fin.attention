overview youbet has established itself as a leading  global brand name for online pari mutuel horse race wagering 
to date  youbet has focused on the united states pari mutuel horse race wagering market through its main product  youbet express sm  which features online wagering  simulcast viewing  and in depth  up to the minute information on horse racing 
youbet s customers receive interactive  real time audio video broadcasts  access to a comprehensive database of handicapping information  and  in most states  the ability to wager on a wide selection of horse races in the united states  canada  australia  south africa  and hong kong 
youbet is working to expand the youbet 
com sm brand  its products  and its services throughout the united states and in select international markets 
in  youbet s focus on long term value creation and profitable growth contributed to the following financial achievements income loss before income taxes increased from a loss of just over million a year ago to a profit of almost million  resulting in our first ever profitable year  highest annual revenues in company history  with revenue growth of million over  strong cash flow generation of approximately million in cash provided by operating activities  and strengthened balance sheet through improved operating expense controls and disciplined capital spending 
in addition to these financial achievements  youbet accomplished the following strategic objectives in to enhance long term shareholder value tvg surrendered its warrant to acquire of youbet s common stock  pursued opportunities in the state of nevada as a means to diversify youbet s revenue sources  analyzed potential industry consolidation opportunities to leverage our technology platform to maximize profitability for youbet  our partner tracks  horseman s groups  and the horse racing industry as a whole  and pursued several expansion opportunities in various international markets to diversify youbet s revenue sources and customer base 
two of our significant content providers  tvg and magna  generated approximately and of our revenues in  and and of our revenues in  respectively 
our higher margin tracks primarily the tracks not subject to our agreements with tvg and magna  accounted for and of our revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
overall revenue growth was driven  in part  by our growth in handle and also by our success at maximizing revenue yield by offering incentives to our customers to wager on tracks that generate the greatest revenue yield to youbet 

table of contents youbet may from time to time require additional capital to fund operations  acquire or lease equipment  reduce its liabilities  and fund its expansion plans consistent with youbet s anticipated changes in operations and infrastructure 
critical accounting estimates and policies although our financial statements necessarily make use of certain accounting estimates by management  except as discussed below  we believe no matters that are the subject of such estimates are so highly uncertain  subjective  complex  or susceptible to change so as to present a significant risk of a material impact on our financial condition or operating performance  except for the change in deferred tax asset valuation allowance see income taxes below  and note to consolidated financial statements 
revenues youbet records commission revenues that are based on the total wagers placed by youbet customers 
we refer to our customers wagers as handle 
the related track and market access fees are recorded as operating expenses when wagers are settled  typically the same day as the wager 
other sources of revenue are relatively insignificant 
incentives offered to customers for them to wager on tracks that generate the greatest margins are deducted from revenues 
pari mutuel racetrack operators typically retain a portion of all wagers as their commission prior to distributing payoffs to the winners 
in accordance with our agreements with tvg  magna and various independent racetracks  youbet receives a fee from each racetrack for wagers delivered to their respective pari mutuel pools 
in the aggregate  these fees represent youbet s primary revenue stream 
youbet expects the majority of its future revenue to be in the form of fees from wagering 
additional revenue is generated from processing fees  monthly subscription fees and the sale of handicapping information 
licensing rights licenses are stated at cost and are amortized over their estimated economic life or agreement term  whichever is shorter 
youbet previously recorded its tvg license rights based on the fair value of the related warrants issued thereunder  using the black scholes option pricing model and amortized the cost over a three year period concluding in may while the tvg license agreement remains in effect at least through may  management concluded that the economic life of the license was much shorter because the estimated useful life of the licensed patented wagering technology for online and automated telephone applications was determined to be three years 
at december   the license rights were fully amortized 
consolidated results of operations for years ended december  and revenues revenues for increased to  compared to  for handle for increased to  compared to  for our year over year revenue growth outpaced year over year handle growth  in part  because youbet discontinued magna s call a bet service during in  youbet reported magna s call a bet revenue at the net commission rate of of handle while current commission rates range from to 
table of contents approximately on average 
also contributing to the higher revenue growth rate is the fact that youbet s customers  in aggregate  have shifted their wagering patterns slightly towards higher margin tracks and exotic wagers such as exactas  trifectas  and superfectas 
exotic wagers generate higher commissions than win place show wagers 
our higher margin tracks primarily the tracks that are not subject to our agreements with tvg and magna accounted for of our commission revenues for the year ended december   an increase of over operating expenses track fees track fees increased to  in  compared to  in the increase was primarily due to an increase in handle

track fees include market area and track specific access fees primarily charged by the various tracks  the california horse racing board  and the oregon racing commission

we will continue to focus on revenue growth through strategic marketing campaigns  technology advancements  and our ability to allocate handle to the highest yielding tracks

as a result of an early redemption of these notes in december  youbet also recorded a one time cash interest expense of  attributable to the charge off of the then unamortized note discount recorded in in  our only interest expense was attributable to equipment leases and insurance premium financing which are not material 
other other income expense of  in was primarily due to the collection of previously written off accounts receivable and certain amounts received from the settlement of certain legal matters 
income taxes youbet s deferred tax asset of approximately  was previously not recognized since management was unable to determine that the asset was more likely than not to be realized 
during  management determined that  of the deferred tax asset should be recognized 
youbet s growth plans potentially may include industry consolidation  acquisitions  international expansion  and expansion into other gaming businesses 
although management anticipates that all potential transactions will be accretive to earnings  management is aware of the risks involved with such a growth strategy 
therefore  based on the current level of uncertainty combined with our cautious optimism  management believes that  of the deferred tax asset being recognized now is supportable

we expect that our cash flow from operations and our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
however  we may from time to time seek additional capital to fund our operations  reduce our 
table of contents liabilities  and fund our expansion plans consistent with our anticipated changes in operations and infrastructure 
to raise capital  we may seek to sell additional equity securities  issue debt or convertible securities or seek to obtain credit facilities through financial institutions

 and and rescission of fin 
the following is a summary of the agreements that youbet has determined are within the scope of fin under its bylaws and certain consulting and employment agreements  youbet has agreed to indemnify its officers  directors  and other service providers 
the term of the indemnification period is for the individual s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments youbet could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited 
however  youbet has a director and officer liability insurance policy that limits its exposure and enables it to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
as a result of its insurance policy coverage  youbet believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal and has recorded no liabilities for these agreements as of december  youbet enters into indemnification provisions under its agreements with other companies in its ordinary course of business 
under these provisions  youbet generally indemnifies the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result of youbet s activities 
these indemnification provisions generally survive termination of the underlying agreement 
youbet has not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements 
as a result  youbet believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal 
accordingly  youbet has no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of december  contractual obligations  contingent liabilities and commitments youbet has contractual obligations and commitments primarily with regard to facilities leases and employment contracts 
the following table aggregates youbet s expected contractual obligations and commitments subsequent to december

recent accounting pronouncements in december   the financial accounting standards board fasb sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires that compensation cost related to share based employee compensation transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
share based employee compensation transactions within the scope of sfas r include stock options  restricted stock plans  performance based awards  stock appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans 
the provisions of sfas r are effective as of the first interim period that begins after june  accordingly  youbet will implement the revised standard in the third quarter of fiscal year currently  youbet accounts for its share based employee compensation transactions under the provisions of apb  which does not necessarily require the recognition of compensation cost in the financial statements 
we have not completed our evaluation or determined the impact of adopting sfas r  which may be material to our results of operations in the third quarter of fiscal year and thereafter 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
the amendments made by sfas are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
further  the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
the statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not expect to enter into any material transactions that would be affected by adopting sfas 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk and related changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
as of december   our portfolio of investments included  in cash and cash equivalents and  of restricted cash 
our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents consists of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase 
the average yield on our investments was approximately at december  due to the conservative nature of our investment portfolio  we believe that a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio 
the impact on our future interest income will depend largely on the gross amount of our investment portfolio 
we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates
