table of contents management s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties discussed below  and identified in the section of this annual report on form k entitled risk factors that may affect future results that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated 
overview our primary source of revenue is the sale of our software and hardware products and consulting services combined with the resale of software applications and hardware products sourced or assembled from third parties 
for logical access control needs  we develop biometric and smart card application software  and resell biometric and smart card hardware and device control software from leading manufacturers 
biometric technologies automatically identify individuals by electronically capturing a specific biological or behavioral characteristic of that individual  such as a fingerprint  iris pattern  voiceprint or facial feature  creating a unique digital identifier from that characteristic and then comparing it against a previously created and stored digital identifier 
because this process relies on largely unalterable human characteristics  it is both highly secure and highly convenient for the individual seeking access 
smart card solutions operate similarly for identity verification and authentication but typically are used in conjunction with a public key infrastructure pki deployment 
smart cards employing pki technology can be used for logical access decisions as well as securing electronic communications 
our software products are designed for large scale and complex computer networks  facilities  and manufacturing automation systems  and allow users seeking access or performing transactions to be identified using various biometric technologies 
our products comply with recognized industry standards  which allow us to integrate a large variety of biometric technologies within a common application environment without costly development related to each technology 
our products also provide our customers with the flexibility to deploy a mixture of different biometric technologies within their network to meet specific user and environmental requirements while providing protection against technology obsolescence since new devices can be added to  or upgraded within  the system without replacing or modifying the underlying biometric network support infrastructure 
our financial focus continues to be the growth of our top line revenue while maintaining acceptable gross margins 
we believe that our products and services are best sold through a consultative sales approach that requires experienced enterprise sales personnel to pursue and manage sales opportunities over several months  and possibly beyond a year in length 
we believe our current headcount in the area of sales and marketing is sufficient for us to attain meaningful top line revenue growth in the future 
the primary challenge for management is to convert a significant sales pipeline into revenue 
we believe that we have been successful in building and managing a relatively large sales pipeline of opportunities 
however  we have not been successful in converting this pipeline into significant revenue 
some of the primary challenges that can impact our success in this area include general market factors influencing purchasing of computer network and security solutions  a relatively long sales cycle associated with our types of solutions and services  and the relative immaturity of the biometrics market 
our ability to translate the value proposition of our products and services into revenue will be a key factor in our ability to achieve financial and operational success 
the biometrics market is relatively immature and new to numerous potential customers in the commercial or governmental sectors 
this makes it even more important  compared to a more mature or established market  that we successfully identify the positive attributes of our solutions  and then translate those to the customers  so that they are motivated to purchase our products and services 
among the key challenges to our business is whether we can establish sales and profitability success prior to the emergence of a dominant competitor in our targeted markets 
our goal has been to grow our market share while the biometric market matures 
to be successful in this area  we will need to see our revenues significantly 
table of contents increase as the market matures  while we maintain an operating expense structure that grows modestly  if at all 
we believe that sales of large enterprise deployments  in the public or private sector  will be the first signs that we are beginning to achieve our goal of growth in market share 
on august   we merged with ssp litronic  which was subsequently renamed litronic  inc and is our wholly owned subsidiary 
we acquired all of the outstanding shares of ssp litronic common stock in a stock for stock transaction where each outstanding share of ssp litronic common stock was converted into the right to receive shares of our common stock 
we issued  shares of our common stock in exchange for the outstanding shares of ssp litronic common stock 
litronic designs and develops innovative data and communication security solutions for both corporate and government institutions 
litronic also provides network security  desktop protection  and high assurance messaging systems for many organizations of the us government 
we believe that our merger with ssp litronic  among other benefits  will help broaden our customer base and will enable us to offer an integrated smart card plus biometric solution to the government and commercial sectors 
on december   we acquired certain assets and rights used in connection with the digital identity and biometric enhanced physical access security business of information systems support  inc iss and biometric solutions group  inc bsg 
the primary reason we made the purchase was to expand our market by entering the physical access market and to meld the physical access product into our existing logical access product 
we paid approximately million  which consisted of  in cash and  shares of our common stock 
we acquired certain intellectual property  tangible assets and inventory in the transaction 
we did not assume any liabilities on behalf of bsg as part of this acquisition  other than to accept assignment of a facilities lease for the offices of bsg in charleston  south carolina 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of commitments and contingencies 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we derive revenue from license fees for software products  selling our manufactured hardware  reselling third party hardware and software applications  and fees for services related to these software and hardware products  including maintenance services  installation and integration consulting services 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by sop and related interpretations  including technical practice aids  which provides specific guidance and stipulates that revenue recognized from software arrangements is to be allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the relative fair values of the elements  such as software products  upgrades  enhancements  post contract customer support  installation  integration and or training 
under this guidance  the determination of fair value is based on objective evidence that is specific to the vendor 
in multiple element arrangements in which fair value exists for undelivered elements  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the residual arrangement fee is assigned to the delivered elements 
if evidence of fair value for any of the undelivered elements does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value does exist  or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered 

table of contents we recognize revenue from biometric software and data security license fees upon delivery  net of an allowance for estimated returns  provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  collection is probable  the fee is fixed or determinable  and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total fee to elements of the arrangement 
if customers receive pilot or test versions of products  we recognize revenue from these arrangements upon customer acceptance of permanent license rights 
if our software is sold through a reseller  we recognize revenue when the reseller delivers its product to the end user 
certain software delivered under a license requires a separate annual maintenance contract that governs the conditions of post contract customer support 
post contract customer support services can be purchased under a separate contract on the same terms and at the same pricing  whether purchased at the time of sale or at a later date 
we recognize revenue from these separate maintenance support contracts ratably over the maintenance period 
other software delivered under a license includes a first year of maintenance  in which case we recognize the value of such maintenance ratably over the initial license period 
the value of such deferred maintenance revenue is established by the price at which the customer may purchase a renewal maintenance contract 
we recognize revenue from hardware that we manufacture generally upon shipment  unless contract terms call for a later date  net of an allowance for estimated returns  provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  collection is probable  the fee is fixed or determinable  and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total fee to elements of the arrangement 
revenue from some data security hardware products contains embedded software 
however  the embedded software is considered incidental to the hardware product sale 
we also act as a reseller of third party hardware and software applications 
generally  we recognize such revenue upon shipment of the hardware or software application  unless contract terms call for a later date  provided that all other conditions above have been met 
service revenue includes payments under support and upgrade contracts and consulting fees 
we recognize support and upgrade revenue ratably over the term of the contract  which typically is twelve months 
consulting revenue primarily relates to installation  integration and training services performed on a time and materials or fixed fee basis under separate service arrangements 
fees from consulting are recognized as services are performed 
if a transaction includes both license and service elements  license fees are recognized separately upon delivery of the licensed software  provided services do not include significant customization or modification of the software product  the licenses are not subject to acceptance criteria  and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total fee to elements of the arrangement 
if the services do include significant customization or modification of the software product or if the services are under a fixed fee contract  we recognize the revenue in accordance with the relevant guidance from the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
we recognize revenue for these types of arrangements as services are rendered using the percentage of completion method with progress to complete measured using labor hour or labor cost inputs 
cost estimates on percentage of completion contracts are reviewed periodically with adjustments recorded in the period in which the revisions are made 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as they are determinable 
the complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting affect the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including labor rates  availability of qualified personnel and project requirement and or scope changes 
billings on uncompleted contracts may be less than or greater than the revenues recognized and are recorded as either unbilled receivable an asset or deferred revenue a liability in the consolidated financial statements 
our revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of assets of businesses acquired 
we have applied the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 since adoption on january  goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized 
we assess the impairment of goodwill on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill relates is less than the carrying value 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following poor economic performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry  economic or company specific trends  changes in the manner of its use of the assets or the plans for its business  and loss of key personnel 
if we were to determine that the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying value  including goodwill  based upon the annual test or the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we would measure impairment based on a comparison of the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of a reporting unit to its assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill 
to the extent the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill  we would record an impairment charge for the difference 
we also assess the impairment of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives on at least an annual basis  or more frequently if any of the above factors exist that might cause impairment to the carrying value 
we compare the fair value of the intangible asset  which is determined based on a discounted cash flow valuation method  with the carrying value of the intangible asset 
if we were to determine that the fair value of an intangible asset was less than its carrying value  based upon the discounted cash flow valuation  we would recognize impairment loss in the amount of the difference between fair value and the carrying value of the asset 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived asset sfas no 
 we review long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we measure recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  we would recognize an impairment charge in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
stock based compensation we applied the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations including financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb opinion no 
 issued in march  to account for our employee stock options 
under this method  compensation expense is recognized only if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price on the date of grant

table of contents stock based compensation  and fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment to fasb statement no 
 established accounting and disclosure requirements using a fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation plans 
as permitted by existing accounting standards  we elected to continue to apply the intrinsic value based method of accounting described above  and have adopted only the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 as amended 
we accounted for non employee stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
valuation of outstanding warrants in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 
 we classified certain warrants to purchase shares of our common stock as a liability because they contain characteristics of debt 
we value the outstanding warrants using a black scholes model and use estimates for an expected dividend yield  a risk free interest rate  and price volatility of our common stock 
each interim period and year end  as long as the warrants are outstanding and contain characteristics of debt  the warrants will be revalued and any difference from the previous valuation date will be recognized as a change in fair value of outstanding warrants in our statement of operations 
results of operating activities we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be a meaningful basis to predict our future performance 
you should consider our prospects in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
we may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties 
we review financial information on a consolidated basis and  therefore  have operated as single segment for all periods discussed 
we incurred a net loss attributable to common stockholders of million for the year ended december   as compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of million for the year ended december  excluding a warrant modification charge of million related to our july special warrant offering in which we lowered the exercise price of certain warrants to  the net loss for the year ended december   was million 
besides the warrant modification charge  the increased net loss was primarily caused by the acquisition of ssp litronic  which nearly doubled our headcount and added two additional facilities 
in addition  the intangible asset amortization related to this acquisition was million for the twelve months ended december  the following discussion presents certain changes in our revenue and operating expenses which have occurred between fiscal years and  and between fiscal years and  and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  included elsewhere in this form k 
year ended december   compared to year ended december  revenue and cost of revenue revenue of million for the year ended december   increased compared to revenue of million for the year ended december  revenue of million came from product sales and million from services during product revenue increased by million in  while service revenue increased by  product revenue consists of license fees for software products  sales of our manufactured hardware and the reselling of third party hardware and software applications 
the increase in product revenue was primarily due to the additional hardware and software revenue contributed by litronic  after the acquisition 
table of contents of ssp litronic on august  during  software license revenue increased by  while the sales of our own hardware and third party hardware increased by million  the majority of which can be attributed to litronic 
also  included in product revenue is the sale of third party software applications  which was  in  compared to no sales in the service revenue increase of  in over was primarily related to work performed on several government projects  either directly through the government or as a subcontractor to a systems integrator  as well as the completion of our development project in the manufacturing automation vertical market 
during  one customer bearingpoint  inc accounted for of our revenue  which was earned as a subcontractor to them on two government projects 
sales to the government accounted for of revenue in cost of revenue consisted of software packaging and materials  the cost our manufactured hardware  the cost of third party hardware and software applications  the cost of labor and services related to projects and software maintenance  as well as the amortization of intangible assets 
our cost of revenue increased from  in to million in this increase was directly related to the increase in revenue in over  and can also be attributed to the addition of million in amortization of intangible assets in connection with our asset purchase from bsg and iss on december   and our merger with ssp litronic on august  gross margin percentage  excluding the effect of the amortization of intangible assets  was also down in  when compared to  due to the higher mix of hardware revenue to software revenue during this change in product mix can also be attributed to the ssp litronic merger  since of that subsidiary s revenue was hardware  which garners a lower gross margin percentage than software 
the cost of revenue  as a percentage of sales  may increase as a result of amortization of intangible assets acquired in the ssp litronic merger 
this amortization  classified as cost of revenue  will be approximately  per quarter in  assuming no impairment of any of these intangible values 
the cost of revenue could also be impacted by a shift in the software and hardware revenue mix 
with the addition of litronic  our hardware sales as percentage of total products sales are likely to increase in the coming year  thus increasing our cost of sales related to product revenue 
operating expenses operating expenses increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to the two business combinations consummated during december and august  which added approximately new employees and three new facility locations 
the following table provides a breakdown of the dollar and percentage changes in operating expenses from to changes in operating expenses s percent product development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangible assets n a stock based compensation product development product development expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits  allocated rent expense  supplies and equipment for software developers and architects  hardware engineers  program managers and quality assurance personnel  as well as legal fees associated with our intellectual property 
product development expenses increased 
table of contents from million in to million in the increase in product development costs was primarily due to increased compensation and related benefits of million  increased general and other expenses of  increased occupancy expense of  increased travel of  and a net increase of  for all other categories 
product development headcount increased by a net employees  or  in  which was the main cause of the increase in product development expense when compared to in january  we reduced product development headcount by employees 
as of march   we had employees in product development departments and we expect that number to remain fairly constant throughout sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions earned by sales and marketing personnel  trade show and promotional expenses  allocated rent and supplies  and travel and entertainment costs 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in the increase in sales and marketing costs was primarily due to increases in compensation and related benefit costs of million  occupancy expenses of  and a net increase in all other categories of  this increase can primarily be attributed to the additional headcount and reston  virginia sales office that were added as a result of the ssp litronic merger 
sales and marketing headcount increased by employees  or  in in january  we reduced our sales and marketing headcount by employees 
as of march   we had employees in sales and marketing departments and we expect that number to remain fairly constant throughout general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits  allocated rent and supplies  and related costs for our executive  finance  legal  human resource  information technology and administrative personnel  and professional services fees  including legal counsel and audit fees 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in the increase in general and administrative costs was primarily due to increases in personnel costs of million  legal and professional services of  occupancy costs of  travel and entertainment costs of  and general supplies  equipment and insurance expense increases of  these increases were also directly related to the ssp litronic merger in august  which added employees  approximately doubling the size of the department in terms of headcount 
in january  we reduced our general and administrative headcount by employees 
as of march   we had employees in general and administrative departments and we expect that number to remain fairly constant throughout amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets is related to non competition agreements we have with certain executives related to the asset purchase from bsg and iss in december and various intangible assets related to the merger with ssp litronic in august these assets were valued as of the date acquired and are being amortized over their estimated useful lives 
amortization of intangible assets  excluding amounts included in cost of revenue  was  and  for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
we expect amortization of intangible assets to increase in  assuming no impairment of the underlying assets  as we incur a full year of expense related to the ssp litronic merger 
in  we decided to discontinue use of two tradenames that were acquired in connection with the ssp litronic merger and will incur a  impairment loss on intangible assets during the first quarter of 
table of contents this will not affect the anticipated amounts for amortization of intangible assets in because  as of the acquisition date  the tradenames were deemed to have indefinite lives and were not being amortized during stock based compensation deferred stock based compensation is amortized over the vesting periods of the equity instrument 
stock based compensation for is primarily related to the issuance of restricted common stock grants to certain executives in june and august  the issuance of options to purchase shares of common stock to employees at an exercise price less than fair market value  and the assumption of options to purchase common stock in connection with the merger with ssp litronic in august stock based compensation expense was  and  for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
for   in stock based compensation was related to employees and classified as compensation and related benefits  while  was related to the amendment of stock options held by third party consultants and has been classified in legal and professional services 
during  all stock based compensation expense related to the issuance of options and warrants to third party consultants and was amortized over the consultant s period of performance 
in  the  in stock based compensation expense was classified as legal and professional service 
we expect stock based compensation to increase in  as we incur a full year of amortization expense related to the june and august issuances of restricted common stock and the assumption of stock options related to the ssp litronic merger 
interest expense interest expense for the twelve months ended december   and  was  and  respectively 
interest expense during and consisted of interest accrued from the financing of certain insurance policies over a nine month period and  as of the ssp litronic merger in august  included interest expense related to the convertible notes assumed in that acquisition 
we expect interest expense to increase in  as we will incur a full year of interest expense related to the outstanding convertible note  assuming it is held to its maturity date of december  other income  net other income  net for the twelve months ended december   and  was  and  respectively 
other income primarily consisted of interest earned on cash  money market balances and short term certificates of deposit 
the increase was due to increased cash balances during when compared to income tax provision we recorded a non cash income tax provision of  for the twelve months ended december  this charge is required because we have a deferred tax liability related to goodwill associated with our bsg asset purchase  which is being amortized for tax purposes  but not for book purposes 
as the goodwill has an indeterminable life  we cannot reasonably estimate the amount  if any  of deferred tax liabilities related to bsg goodwill which will reverse during the net operating loss carry forward period  and thus offset deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we increase the valuation allowance with a corresponding deferred tax provision as the deferred tax liability related to bsg goodwill increases due to continued amortization of goodwill for tax purposes 
change in fair value of outstanding warrant change in fair value of outstanding warrants for the twelve months ended december   resulted in a net gain of million  while there was no change in fair value of outstanding warrants during the change in fair value of outstanding warrants was related to two separate warrant issuances that had potential cash obligations and thus giving these equity instruments debt characteristics 

table of contents the majority of the non cash gain is related to warrants issued in connection with the february financing 
per the original registration rights agreement  if we did not meet certain criteria  we may have been required to pay liquidated damages to each stockholder until the applicable event was cured 
on september   we amended the registration rights agreement to substitute our cash obligation to remedy any conditions that were not met  with shares of common stock instead 
the gain of million represents the change in fair value between the initial grant date  february   and the day the registration rights agreement was amended  september  the fair value of the outstanding warrants as of september   was reclassified to equity as the registration rights amendment eliminated the debt characteristics of these warrants 
in addition  our litronic merger triggered certain redemption provisions in connection with our series a warrants 
the cash redemption value was estimated to be  as of august   the date we notified the warrant holders of the merger  and is fixed as long as the warrants are outstanding or until expiration in june on august   the closing date of the merger  these warrants were reclassified as a liability because the warrants then contained characteristics of a debt instrument 
each interim period and year end until the warrants expire in june  the remaining outstanding warrants will be revalued and any difference from the previous valuation date will be recognized as a change in fair value of outstanding warrants and charged or credited to change in fair value of outstanding warrants

product revenue declined by  in  while service revenue increased by  the decrease in product revenue was primarily due to a  decrease in hardware revenue 
software revenue  however  increased by  during  and partially offset the hardware revenue decline in the combined product revenue total 
the service revenue increase in was mainly attributable to work performed on a development project in the manufacturing automation vertical market 
this project  for a large pharmaceutical company  accounted for  in service revenue during 
table of contents cost of revenue consisted of software materials  third party hardware  and services costs in and our cost of revenue decreased from million in to  in this decrease was primarily driven by a  reduction in software cost of revenue due to the termination of royalty expense associated with a licensing agreement 
hardware and service cost of revenue  as a percentage of hardware and service revenue in were consistent with prior year results 
a more favorable mix of higher margin software compared to lower margin hardware in also contributed to the reduction of cost of revenue 
operating expenses operating expenses increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to a increase in headcount from january   to december   which resulted in a million increase in compensation and related benefits and a  increase in travel and entertainment costs 
advertising and promotion expense increased  due to increased trade show appearances and public relations efforts

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our operations have never generated any net income 
we have accumulated net losses of approximately million from our inception through december   and we have continued to accumulate net losses since december  historically  we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities to investors 
we financed our operations during fiscal primarily from existing working capital at december   million in net proceeds from our private placement in february  net proceeds of million from warrant exercises in july  and million in cash that was acquired through the ssp litronic merger 
as of december   our principal source of liquidity consisted of million in cash and cash equivalents and million of working capital  compared to cash and cash equivalents of million and million in working capital as of december  we invest our cash in excess of current operating requirements in a money market fund with a commercial bank 
we used cash of million for operating activities in  which was million more than the amount used in operations during the increase in the use of cash was primarily due to increased headcount and occupancy expense related to the two business acquisitions completed in december and august cash provided by investing activities was million in  which consisted of million  net of transaction costs  acquired through the ssp litronic merger   in transaction costs paid related to the asset purchase from bsg  and  used for purchases of equipment  furniture and leasehold improvements 
this compares to million used in investing activities in  which included payments of  related to the asset purchase from bsg  and  for furniture  equipment and leasehold improvements 
net cash provided by financing activities increased to million in  compared to million in in february  we raised million in net proceeds through a private financing 
in july  through a warrant modification and subsequent exercises  we raised million in net proceeds  and throughout the year we received  in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
during  there were no private financings  however  we received net proceeds of million from warrant exercises and million from stock option exercises 
as a result of the capital raised and acquired through the merger with ssp litronic during  we believe we have sufficient funds to continue our operations beyond the first quarter of  assuming no significant and unexpected uses of cash 
however  we currently do not have a credit line or other borrowing facility to fund our operations 
in addition  we may not be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms  or at all 
if we need additional cash to fund our operations  we may need to raise capital through the issuance of additional equity securities to investors 
the issuance of a large number of additional equity securities could cause substantial dilution to existing stockholders and could cause a decrease in the market price for shares of our common stock  which could impair our ability to raise capital in the future through the issuance of equity securities 
if we are unable to obtain necessary additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of or to cease our operations 
we currently occupy our headquarters in bellevue  washington under a lease that expires in june  and are required to pay taxes  insurance  and maintenance as well as monthly rental payments 
in addition  we lease office space in edmonton  alberta  canada for our product development team that expires in march further  we lease office space for our government sales team and enterprise solutions group in reston  virginia  which expires in april in connection with our asset purchase from bsg in december  we assumed a lease for our development group in charleston  south carolina  that expires in february and lastly  in connection with our ssp litronic merger on august   we assumed the leases of two properties in irvine  california and reston  virginia  which expire in february and february  respectively

revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires the measurement of all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in an entity s statement of income 
the accounting provisions of sfas r are effective for reporting periods beginning after june  we are required to adopt sfas r in the quarter ending september  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
see stock based compensation note for the pro forma net loss and net loss per share amounts for  and  as if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards 
although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas  we expect the adoption to have a material impact on the consolidated statements of operations for the six months ended december  this estimate is based on preliminary information and could materially change based on actual facts and circumstances arising during the six months ending december  factors that may affect future results this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our business  operating results  financial performance  and share price may be materially adversely affected by a number of factors  including but not limited to the following risk factors  any one of which could cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results or from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by us in this annual report on form k or in other reports  press releases or other statements issued from time to time 
additional factors that may cause such a difference are set forth elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we have accumulated significant losses and may not be able to generate significant revenue or any net income in the future  which would negatively impact our ability to run our business 
we have accumulated net losses of approximately million from our inception through december  we have continued to accumulate losses after december  to date and we may be unable to generate significant revenue or any net income in the future 
we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities to investors and may not be able to generate a positive cash flow in the future 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations  we will need to seek additional funds through the issuance of additional equity or debt securities or other sources of financing 
we may not be able to secure such additional financing on favorable terms  or at all 
any additional financings will likely cause substantial dilution to existing stockholders 
if we are unable to obtain necessary additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of  or cease  our operations 

table of contents we have not generated any significant sales of our products within the competitive commercial market  nor have we demonstrated sales techniques or promotional activities that have proven to be successful on a consistent basis  which makes it difficult to evaluate our business performance or our future prospects 
we are in an emerging  complex and competitive commercial market for digital commerce and communications security solutions 
potential customers in our target markets are becoming increasingly aware of the need for security products and services in the digital economy to conduct their business 
historically  only enterprises that had substantial resources developed or purchased security solutions for delivery of digital content over the internet or through other means 
also  there is a perception that security in delivering digital content is costly and difficult to implement 
therefore  we will not succeed unless we can educate our target markets about the need for security in delivering digital content and convince potential customers of our ability to provide this security in a cost effective and easy to use manner 
even if we convince our target markets about the importance of and need for such security  there can be no assurance that it will result in the sale of our products 
we may be unable to establish sales and marketing operations at levels necessary for us to grow this portion of our business  especially if we are unsuccessful at selling our products into vertical markets 
we may not be able to support the promotional programs required by selling simultaneously into several markets 
if we are unable to develop an efficient sales system  or if our products or components do not achieve wide market acceptance  then our operating results will suffer and our earnings per share will be adversely affected 
a significant number of shares of our common stock are or will be eligible for sale in the open market  which could reduce the market price for our common stock and make it difficult for us to raise capital 
in our merger transaction with ssp litronic we assumed options  warrants and convertible promissory notes of ssp litronic that  as of march   represented the right to acquire  shares of our common stock   of which have exercise or conversion prices below the fair market value of our common stock of as of march  as of march    shares of our common stock were outstanding 
in addition  including the securities assumed in the ssp litronic merger  there were a total of  million shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise or conversion of outstanding options  warrants  and convertible promissory notes 
we have issued options and warrants to acquire shares of common stock to our employees and certain other persons at various prices  some of which have exercise prices below the current market price for our common stock 
as of march   options to acquire  shares of our common stock were outstanding and our existing stock incentive plan had  shares available for future issuance 
the issuance of a large number of additional shares of our common stock upon the exercise or conversion of outstanding options  warrants or convertible promissory notes would cause substantial dilution to existing stockholders and could decrease the market price of our common stock due to the sale of a large number of shares of common stock in the market  or the perception that these sales could occur 
these sales  or the perception of possible sales  could also impair our ability to raise capital in the future 
because they own approximately of our common stock  seven stockholders could significantly influence our affairs  which may preclude other stockholders from being able to influence stockholder votes or corporate actions 
seven of our stockholders together with their affiliates beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock as of march  given this substantial ownership  if they decided to act together  they would be able to significantly influence the vote on those corporate matters to be decided by our stockholders 
in addition  these stockholders hold options  warrants and convertible promissory notes representing the right to acquire an additional  shares of our common stock 
if these stockholders exercised their options and warrants and converted their promissory notes in full  they would own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
such concentrated ownership may decrease the value of our common 
table of contents stock and could significantly influence our affairs  which may preclude other stockholders from being able to influence stockholder votes 
if we do not generate significant revenue from our participation in large government security initiatives or increase the level of our participation in these initiatives  our business performance and future prospects may suffer 
we play various roles in certain large government security initiatives  which includes being a part of the consortium of companies  led by accenture  that was awarded the department of homeland security s us visit contract  and our involvement in the transportation security administration s twic program where our credentialing solutions account for a significant portion of the technology deployment for the prototype or limited deployment phase 
we have invested a substantial amount of time and resources in our efforts to participate in these and other government security initiatives  but we have not generated significant revenue from our participation in these security initiatives to date 
if we are not able to generate significant revenue from our participation in these or other government programs  or if we incur substantial additional expenses related to government programs before we earn associated revenue  we may not have adequate resources to continue to operate or to compete effectively in the government or the commercial marketplace 
if the market for our products and services does not experience significant growth or if our biometric and smart card products do not achieve broad acceptance in this market  our ability to generate significant revenue in the future would be limited and our business would suffer 
a substantial portion of our product revenue and a portion of our service revenue are derived from the sale of biometric and smart card products and services 
biometric and smart card solutions have not gained widespread acceptance 
we cannot accurately predict the future growth rate of this market  if any  or the ultimate size of the biometric and smart card technology market 
the expansion of the market for our products and services depends on a number of factors such as the cost  performance and reliability of our products and services compared to the products and services of our competitors  customers perception of the benefits of biometric and smart card solutions  public perceptions of the intrusiveness of these solutions and the manner in which organizations use the biometric information collected  public perceptions regarding the confidentiality of private information  customers satisfaction with our products and services  and marketing efforts and publicity regarding our products and services 
even if biometric and smart card solutions gain wide market acceptance  our products and services may not adequately address market requirements and may not gain wide market acceptance 
if biometric or smart card solutions or our products and services do not gain wide market acceptance  our business and our financial results will suffer 
our reported financial results will suffer as a result of purchase accounting treatment  the impact of amortization of certain intangibles relating to the merger with ssp litronic and the direct transaction costs of the merger  and may suffer further if goodwill is deemed in the future to have been impaired 
we have accounted for the merger as a purchase of ssp litronic by us under the purchase method of accounting 
under purchase accounting  we recorded the fair value of the consideration given for the ssp litronic common stock and for options and warrants to purchase ssp litronic common stock assumed by us  plus the amount of direct transaction costs  as the cost of acquiring ssp litronic 
we allocated these costs to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including various identifiable intangible assets such as 
table of contents developed technology  acquired trade names  acquired patents  customer relationships  and non competition agreements based on their respective fair values 
goodwill will be tested at least annually  and may be deemed in the future to have been impaired 
as a result  the purchase accounting treatment for the merger will result in a reduction of earnings and earning per share for the foreseeable future 
this change could cause the market price of our stock to decline 
any acquisition we make in the future could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition 
to date  most of our revenue growth has been created by acquisition 
in any future acquisitions or business combinations  we are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including dilution of our current stockholders percentage ownership as a result of the issuance of stock  incurrence or assumption of debt  assumption of unknown liabilities  incurrence of expenses related to the future impairment of goodwill and the amortization of other intangible assets  or incurrence of large write offs immediately or in the future 
we may not be able to successfully complete the integration of the businesses  products or technologies or personnel in the businesses or assets that we might acquire in the future  and any failure to do so could disrupt our business and seriously harm our financial condition 
we have depended on a limited number of customers for a substantial percentage of our revenue  and due to the non recurring nature of these sales  our revenue in any quarter may not be indicative of future revenue 
one customer accounted for of our revenue for the twelve months ended december   while one customer accounted for of our revenue for the twelve months ended december  a substantial reduction in revenue from any of our significant customers would adversely affect our business unless we were able to replace the revenue received from those customers 
as a result of this concentration of revenue from a limited number of customers  our revenue has experienced wide fluctuations  and we may continue to experience wide fluctuations in the future 
many of our sales are not recurring sales  and quarterly and annual sales levels could fluctuate and sales in any period may not be indicative of sales in future periods 
doing business with the united states government entails many risks that could adversely affect us by decreasing the profitability of government contracts we are able to obtain and interfering with our ability to obtain future government contracts 
government sales accounted for of our revenue for the twelve months ended december  our sales to the us government are subject to risks that include early termination of contracts  disallowance of costs upon audit  and the need to participate in competitive bidding and proposal processes  which are costly and time consuming and may result in unprofitable contracts 
in addition  the government may be in a position to obtain greater rights with respect to our intellectual property than we would grant to other entities 
government agencies also have the power  based on financial difficulties or investigations of their contractors  to deem contractors unsuitable for new contract awards 
because we will engage in the government contracting business  we will be subject to audits and may be subject to investigation by governmental entities 
failure to comply with the terms of any government contracts could result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties  as well as suspension from future government 
table of contents contracts for a significant period of time  any of which could adversely affect our business by requiring us to spend money to pay the fines and penalties and prohibiting us from earning revenues from government contracts during the suspension period 
furthermore  government programs can experience delays or cancellation of funding  which can be unpredictable 
for example  the us military s involvement in iraq has caused the diversion of some department of defense funding away from certain projects in which we participate  thereby delaying orders under certain of our government contracts 
this makes it difficult to forecast our revenues on a quarter by quarter basis 
our efforts to expand our international operations are subject to a number of risks  including our potential inability to obtain government authorization regarding exports of our products  any of which could adversely affect our future international sales 
we must comply with us laws regulating the export of our products in order to ship internationally 
in some cases  authorization from the us government may be needed in order to export our products 
the export regimes applicable to our business are subject to frequent changes  as are the governing policies 
although we have obtained approvals to export certain of our products  we cannot assure you that such authorizations to export will be available to us or for our products in the future 
if we cannot obtain the required government approvals under these regulations  we may not be able to sell products abroad or make products available for sale internationally 
additionally  our international operations could be subject to a number of risks  any of which could adversely affect our future international sales  including increased collection risks  trade restrictions  export duties and tariffs  uncertain political  regulatory and economic developments  and inability to protect our intellectual property rights 
if third parties  on whom we partly depend for our product distribution  do not promote our products  our ability to generate revenue may be limited and our business and financial condition could suffer 
we utilize third parties such as resellers  distributors and other technology manufacturers to augment our full time sales staff in promoting sales of our products 
if these third parties do not actively promote our products  our ability to generate revenue may be limited 
we cannot control the amount and timing of resources that these third parties devote to marketing activities on our behalf 
some of these business relationships are formalized in agreements that can be terminated with little or no notice  which may further decrease the willingness of such third parties to act on our behalf 
we also may not be able to negotiate acceptable distribution relationships in the future and cannot predict whether current or future distribution relationships will be successful 
the lengthy and variable sales cycle of some of our products makes it difficult to predict operating results 
certain of our products have lengthy sales cycles while customers complete in depth evaluations of the products and receive approvals for purchase 
in addition  new product introduction often centers on key trade shows and failure to deliver a product prior to such an event can seriously delay introduction of a product 
as a result of the lengthy sales cycles  we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenues because a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and based on expected revenues 
the lengthy sales cycles make forecasting the volume and timing of orders difficult 
in addition  the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional risks that customers may cancel or change their minds 
if customer cancellations or product delays occur  we could lose anticipated sales 

table of contents our failure to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology and intellectual property could adversely affect our business  operating results  financial condition and stock price and our ability to compete effectively 
we principally rely upon patent  trademark  copyright  trade secret and contract law to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
there is a risk that claims allowed on any patents or trademarks we hold may not be broad enough to protect our technology 
in addition  our patents or trademarks may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and we cannot be certain that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to us 
further  because we do business with the government  we may already have granted  or we may in the future have to grant  greater rights with respect to our intellectual property than we would grant to other entities 
moreover  any current or future issued or licensed patents  or trademarks  or existing or future trade secrets or know how  may not afford sufficient protection against competitors with similar technologies or processes  and the possibility exists that certain of our already issued patents or trademarks may infringe upon third party patents or trademarks or be designed around by others 
in addition  there is a risk that others may independently develop proprietary technologies and processes that are the same as  or substantially equivalent or superior to ours  or become available in the market at a lower price 
there is a risk that we have infringed or in the future will infringe patents or trademarks owned by others  that we will need to acquire licenses under patents or trademarks belonging to others for technology potentially useful or necessary to us  and that licenses will not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
we may have to litigate to enforce our patents or trademarks or to determine the scope and validity of other parties proprietary rights 
litigation could be very costly and divert management s attention 
an adverse outcome in any litigation could adversely affect our financial results and stock price 
we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how  which we seek to protect by confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  service providers and third parties 
there is a risk that these agreements may be breached  and that the remedies available to us may not be adequate 
in addition  our trade secrets and proprietary know how may otherwise become known to or be independently discovered by others 
we may be unable to keep pace with rapid technological change in the information security industry  which could lead to an increase in our costs  a loss of customers or a delay in market acceptance of our products 
software design and the biometric and smart card technology industry are characterized by rapid development and technological improvements 
because of these changes  our success will depend in part on our ability to keep pace with a changing marketplace  integrate new technology into our software and hardware and introduce new products and product enhancements to address the changing needs of the marketplace 
various technical problems and resource constraints may impede the development  production  distribution and marketing of our products and services 
in addition  laws  rules  regulations or industry standards may be adopted in response to these technological changes  which in turn  could materially and adversely affect how we will do business 
our future success will also depend upon our ability to develop and introduce a variety of new products and services  and enhancements to these new products and services  to address the changing and sophisticated needs of the marketplace 
frequently  technical development programs in the biometric and smart card industry require assessments to be made of the future directions of technology and technology markets generally  which are inherently risky and difficult to predict 
delays in introducing new products  services and enhancements  the failure to choose correctly among technical alternatives or the failure to offer innovative products and services at competitive prices may cause customers to forego purchases of our products and services and purchase those of our competitors 
our continued participation in the market for governmental agencies may require the investment of our resources in upgrading our products and technology for us to compete and to meet regulatory and statutory standards 
we may not have adequate resources available to us or may not adequately keep pace with appropriate requirements to compete effectively in the marketplace 

table of contents our reliance on third party technologies for some specific technology elements of our products and our reliance on third parties for manufacturing may delay product launch  impair our ability to develop and deliver products or hurt our ability to compete in the market 
our ability to license new technologies from third parties will be critical to our ability to offer a complete suite of products that meets customer needs and technological requirements 
some of our licenses do not run for the full duration of the third party s patent for the licensed technology 
we may not be able to renew our existing licenses on favorable terms  or at all 
if we lose the rights to a patented technology  we may need to stop selling or may need to redesign our products that incorporate that technology  and we may lose a competitive advantage 
in addition  competitors could obtain licenses for technologies for which we are unable to obtain licenses  and third parties may develop or enable others to develop a similar solution to digital communication security issues  either of which events could erode our market share 
also  dependence on the patent protection of third parties may not afford us any control over the protection of the technologies upon which we rely 
if the patent protection of any of these third parties were compromised  our ability to compete in the market also would be impaired 
we face intense competition and pricing pressures from a number of sources  which may reduce our average selling prices and gross margins 
the markets for our products and services are intensely competitive 
as a result  we face significant competition from a number of sources 
we may be unable to compete successfully because many of our competitors are more established  benefit from greater name recognition and have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we have 
in addition  there are several smaller and start up companies with which we compete from time to time 
we expect competition to increase as a result of consolidation in the information security technology industry 
the average selling prices for our products may decline as a result of competitive pricing pressures  promotional programs and customers who negotiate price reductions in exchange for longer term purchase commitments 
the pricing of products depends on the specific features and functions of the products  purchase volumes and the level of sales and service support required 
as we experience pricing pressure  the average selling prices and gross margins for our products may decrease over product lifecycles 
these same competitive pressures may require us to write down the carrying value of any inventory on hand  which would adversely affect our operating results and adversely affect our earnings per share 
any compromise of public key infrastructure  or pki  technology would adversely affect our business by reducing or eliminating demand for many of our information security products 
as a result of our merger with ssp litronic  many of our products are now based on pki technology  which is the standard technology for securing internet based commerce and communications 
the security afforded by this technology depends on the integrity of a user s private key  which depends in part on the application of algorithms  or advanced mathematical factoring equations 
the occurrence of any of the following could result in a decline in demand for our information security products any significant advance in techniques for attacking pki systems  including the development of an easy factoring method or faster  more powerful computers  publicity of the successful decoding of cryptographic messages or the misappropriation of private keys  and government regulation limiting the use  scope or strength of pki 
a security breach of our internal systems or those of our customers due to computer hackers or cyber terrorists could harm our business by adversely affecting the market s perception of our products and services 
since we provide security for internet and other digital communication networks  we may become a target for attacks by computer hackers 
the ripple effects throughout the economy of terrorist threats and attacks and military activities may have a prolonged effect on our potential commercial customers  or on their ability to 
table of contents purchase our products and services 
additionally  because we provide security products to the united states government  we may be targeted by cyber terrorist groups for activities threatened against united states based targets 
we will not succeed unless the marketplace is confident that we provide effective security protection for internet and other digital communication networks 
networks protected by our products may be vulnerable to electronic break ins 
because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques 
although we have never experienced any act of sabotage or unauthorized access by a third party of our internal network to date  if an actual or perceived breach of security for internet and other digital communication networks occurs in our internal systems or those of our end user customers  it could adversely affect the market s perception of our products and services 
this could cause us to lose customers  resellers  alliance partners or other business partners 
our financial and operating results often vary significantly from quarter to quarter and may be adversely affected by a number of factors 
our financial and operating results have fluctuated in the past and our financial and operating results could fluctuate in the future from quarter to quarter for the following reasons reduced demand for our products and services  price reductions  new competitors  or the introduction of enhanced products or services from new or existing competitors  changes in the mix of products and services we or our distributors sell  contract cancellations  delays or amendments by customers  the lack of government demand for our products and services or the lack of government funds appropriated to purchase our products and services  unforeseen legal expenses  including litigation costs  expenses related to acquisitions  other non recurring financial charges  the lack of availability or increase in cost of key components and subassemblies  and the inability to successfully manufacture in volume  and reduce the price of  certain of our products that may contain complex designs and components 
particularly important is our need to invest in planned technical development programs to maintain and enhance our competitiveness  and to develop and launch new products and services 
improving the manageability and likelihood of success of such programs requires the development of budgets  plans and schedules for the execution of these programs and the adherence to such budgets  plans and schedules 
the majority of such program costs are payroll and related staff expenses  and secondarily materials  subcontractors and promotional expenses 
these costs will be very difficult to adjust in response to short term fluctuations in our revenue  compounding the difficulty of achieving profitability 
we may be exposed to significant liability for actual or perceived failure to provide required products or services 
products as complex as those we offer may contain undetected errors or may fail when first introduced or when new versions are released 
despite our product testing efforts and testing by current and potential customers  it is possible that errors will be found in new products or enhancements after commencement of 
table of contents commercial shipments 
the occurrence of product defects or errors could result in adverse publicity  delay in product introduction  diversion of resources to remedy defects  loss of or a delay in market acceptance  or claims by customers against us  or could cause us to incur additional costs  any of which could adversely affect our business 
because our customers rely on our products for critical security applications  we may be exposed to claims for damages allegedly caused to an enterprise as a result of an actual or perceived failure of our products 
an actual or perceived breach of enterprise network or information security systems of one of our customers  regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products or solutions  could adversely affect our business reputation 
furthermore  our failure or inability to meet a customer s expectations in the performance of our services  or to do so in the time frame required by the customer  regardless of our responsibility for the failure  could result in a claim for substantial damages against us by the customer  discourage customers from engaging us for these services  and damage our business reputation 
delays in deliveries from suppliers or defects in goods or components supplied by vendors could cause our revenues and gross margins to decline 
our litronic business relies on a limited number of vendors for certain components for the products it is developing 
any undetected flaws in components supplied by its vendors could lead to unanticipated costs to repair or replace these parts 
litronic currently purchases some of its components from a single supplier  which presents a risk that the components may not be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
for example  atmel corporation has completed the masks for production of specially designed fort and jfort microprocessors for which litronic developed the fort and jfort operating systems 
commercial acceptance of the fort and jfort microprocessors will depend on continued development of applications to service customer requirements 
any inability to receive or any delay in receiving adequate supplies of the fort and jfort microprocessors  whether as a result of delays in development of applications or otherwise  would adversely affect our ability to sell the fort and jfort pki cards 
we do not anticipate maintaining a supply agreement with atmel corporation for the fort and jfort microprocessors 
if atmel corporation were unable to deliver the fort and jfort microprocessors for a lengthy period of time or were to terminate its relationship with us  we would be unable to produce the fort and jfort pki cards until we could design a replacement computer chip for the fort and jfort microprocessors 
this could take substantial time and resources to complete  resulting in delays or reductions in product shipments that could adversely affect our business by requiring us to expend resources while preventing us from selling the fort and jfort pki cards 
government regulations affecting security of internet and other digital communication networks could limit the market for our products and services 
the united states government and foreign governments have imposed controls  export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies  including encryption technology 
any additional governmental regulation of imports or exports or failure to obtain required export approval of encryption technologies could delay or prevent the acceptance and use of encryption products and public networks for secure communications and could limit the market for our products and services 
in addition  some foreign competitors are subject to less rigorous controls on exporting their encryption technologies 
as a result  they may be able to compete more effectively than us in the united states and in international security markets for internet and other digital communication networks 
in addition  governmental agencies such as the federal communications commission periodically issue regulations governing the conduct of business in telecommunications markets that may adversely affect the telecommunications industry and us 
litronic has outsourced a portion of our commercial software development to india  which could prove to be unprofitable due to risks inherent in international business activities 
litronic has outsourced portions of its commercial software development activities to india in an effort to reduce operating expenses 
we are subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities 
table of contents that could adversely affect any operations we may develop in india and could slow our growth 
these risks generally include  among others difficulties in managing and staffing indian operations  difficulties in obtaining or maintaining regulatory approvals or in complying with indian laws  reduced or less certain protection for intellectual property rights  negative public perception of outsourcing and its consequences  trade restrictions  foreign currency fluctuations  civil unrest and hostilities among neighboring countries  and general economic conditions  including instability  in the indian economy 
any of these risks could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
conflicts involving india could adversely affect any operations we may establish in india  which could interfere with our ability to conduct any or all of our other operations 
if we fail to attract and retain qualified senior executive and key technical personnel  our business will not be able to expand 
we will be dependent on the continued availability of the services of our employees  many of whom are individually keys to our future success  and the availability of new employees to implement our business plans 
although our compensation program is intended to attract and retain the employees required for us to be successful  there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain the services of all of our key employees or a sufficient number to execute our plans  nor can there be any assurance that we will be able to continue to attract new employees as required 
our personnel may voluntarily terminate their relationship with us at any time  and competition for qualified personnel  especially engineers  is intense 
the process of locating additional personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out our strategy could be lengthy  costly and disruptive 
if we lose the services of key personnel  or fail to replace the services of key personnel who depart  we could experience a severe negative impact on our financial results and stock price 
in addition  there is intense competition for highly qualified engineering and marketing personnel in the locations where we will principally operate 
the loss of the services of any key engineering  marketing or other personnel or our failure to attract  integrate  motivate and retain additional key employees could adversely affect on our business and financial results and stock price 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation may prevent or adversely affect the value of a takeover of our company even if a takeover would be beneficial to stockholders 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock  the issuance of which could adversely affect our common stockholders 
we can issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and upon terms and conditions  and having those types of rights  privileges and preferences  as our board of directors determines 
specifically  the potential issuance of preferred stock may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or may discourage a third party from acquiring  voting control of our company even if the acquisition would benefit stockholders 

table of contents item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to money market funds included in our investment portfolio 
investments in fixed rate earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk as their fair market value may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
as a result  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates 
we do not use any hedging transactions or any financial instruments for trading purposes and we are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
due to the nature of our investment portfolio  we believe that we are not subject to any material market risk exposure 
we have canadian operations whose expenses are incurred in its local currency  the canadian dollar 
as exchange rates vary  transaction gains or losses will be incurred and may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall profitability 
if in and  the us dollar uniformly changed in strength by relative to the currency of the foreign operations  our operating results would likely not be significantly affected 
we have a current liability related to warrants and the value is dependent upon the market price of our common stock 
the value of these warrants is estimated using the black scholes model  which incorporates the market price of our common stock as a significant variable 
the value of these warrants was  at december  as long as the warrants are outstanding  this value will fluctuate each reporting period to reflect the change in fair value of these warrants from period to period 
the value will increase if the stock price and volatility increase  and will decrease through the passage of time as the term of the warrants gets shorter  or if the stock price and volatility decrease 
however  the value cannot fall below  the cash redemption value of the warrants 
the fluctuation in value will be in the form of a gain or a loss  depending upon the estimated valuation  and will be reflected in the condensed consolidated statement of operations 
if  as of december   the closing price of our common stock would have ended higher or lower than the actual close price  our net loss would have been either increased or decreased by approximately  respectively 
we did not have these warrants classified as liabilities in
