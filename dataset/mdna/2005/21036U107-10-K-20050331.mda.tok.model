item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a manufacturer of pet plastic containers for food and beverages 
approximately of the company s revenues were generated in the united states with the remainder attributable to its european operations 
during  one customer accounted for approximately of the company s consolidated revenues  while the top ten customers accounted for an aggregate of of the company s consolidated revenues 
approximately of the company s sales relate to conventional pet containers which are primarily used for carbonated soft drinks and bottled water 
these products generally carry low profit margins 
profitability is driven principally by volume and maintaining efficient manufacturing operations 
in recent years  the largest growth within conventional products has come from bottled water 
the company believes that in the long run  profitability from bottled water may decline as economic factors force some water bottlers into self manufacturing of pet bottles and some smaller water bottlers out of business 
the company does not expect appreciable growth in the carbonated soft drink market in the near term 
in addition to the conventional product lines  the company is also a producer of higher margin custom products that are used in such packaging applications as hot fill beverages  food  beer and flavored alcoholic beverages  most of which require containers with special performance characteristics 
critical success factors in the custom pet market include technology  design capabilities and expertise with specialized equipment 
the technology required to produce certain types of custom products is commonly available  which has resulted in increased competition and lower margins for such products 
the pet packaging industry is in a very competitive pricing environment 
although the industry s available capacity appears to be tightening  the company is still encountering price competition 
the company expects its competitors to continue to bid aggressively when customer contracts expire 
many of the company s largest contracts are scheduled to expire over the next few years 
the company s main contract with pepsico expires on december  the company believes that it will continue to face two other significant sources of pricing pressure 
the first source is customer consolidation 
when smaller customers combine or are acquired by larger customers or customers purchase through buying cooperatives and thereby aggregate purchasing power  the profitability of constar s business with the smaller customer tends to decline 
in addition  as customers grow through acquisitions  they acquire more leverage in contract negotiations 
the second source of pricing pressure is contractual provisions that permit customers to terminate contracts if the customer receives an offer from another manufacturer that the company chooses not to match 
the company is making efforts to remove these provisions in all new contracts and contract renewals 
thus  despite a reduction in the industry s available capacity  price declines remain a concern 
the company continues to focus its efforts on effective cost controls  manufacturing efficiencies and overhead reductions in an effort to offset pricing pressures 
in negotiations with certain customers for new business and the extension of current business  the company has agreed to price concessions averaging approximately million to million for each year between and  with the most significant reductions scheduled to take place in the company is currently engaged in negotiations with certain customers regarding amendments to their contracts which may include price reductions in addition to the range stated above 
constar is currently attempting to improve its margins by improving customer and product mix  maximizing utilization rates  updating existing facilities and investing in cost reduction and efficiency improvements 
if the company is unsuccessful in its efforts to reduce costs and improve efficiencies  its ability to maintain its current operating margins will be adversely affected 
during the second and third quarters of  constar operated at high utilization rates  however the company does not intend to invest in additional capacity in the low margin conventional business until overall margins and prices increase to levels where acceptable returns can be achieved 
the primary raw material and component cost of the company s products is pet resin which is a commodity available globally 
the price of pet resin is subject to frequent fluctuations as a result of oil and gas 
table of contents prices  overseas markets and seasonal demand 
the price of resin has been increasing dramatically due to increases in the price of petrochemical products 
constar is one of the largest purchasers of pet resin in north america  which it believes provides it with negotiating leverage necessary to obtain pet resin on favorable terms 
however  higher resin prices may impact the company s sales where customers have a choice between pet and other forms of packaging 
during this period of dramatic increases in resin prices  several of constar s customers have had difficulty passing these costs along within their markets 
as a result  there has been increased pricing pressure placed on the company to absorb these increased prices 
as a result  the company may be faced with lost volume or demands for additional selling price reductions in the near term which would negatively impact future operating results unless the company can offset these exposures with additional cost reductions or more favorable purchasing arrangements with its raw material suppliers 
substantially all of the company s sales are made under contracts that allow for the pass through of changes in the price of pet resin 
an industry index that monitors pet resin price movement and which is used for the resin pass through mechanisms of customer agreements representing approximately of the company s net sales made a significant non market adjustment in its january report to re set its index basis 
because this adjustment does not reflect changes in current resin costs  constar believes it should not result in a decrease in its resin prices as reflected in the pass through provisions in its customer contracts that use this index 
the company has discussed this matter with affected customers and most of them have agreed not to reflect this adjustment 
if constar is required to reflect this adjustment in affected customer contracts  it will adversely affect the company s sales and margins insofar as its resin costs will not have decreased correspondingly 
pet bottle manufacturing is capital intensive  requiring both specialized production equipment and significant support infrastructure for power  high pressure air and resin handling 
constar believes that the introduction of new pet technologies has created significant opportunities for the conversion of glass containers to pet containers for bottled teas  beer  flavored alcoholic beverages and food applications 
these conversion opportunities will require significant capital expenditures to obtain the appropriate production equipment 
the company s ability to make capital expenditures is limited by the covenants contained in the new credit facility discussed below 
if constar is awarded a significant volume of conversions over a short period of time  it may have to obtain waivers or amendments to these covenants 
in order to capture economies of scale  the company favors large plants located within a few hours driving distance of the major markets that it service 
normally  this proximity helps the company to minimize freight costs 
however  in order to meet its customers requirements  the company must sometimes manufacture products at a plant that is not its closest plant to the necessary delivery location 
constar s contracts typically would require it to bear the resulting added freight costs 
these out of territory freight costs tend to peak during the second and third quarters  when the company s customers requirements are at their highest 
in addition  any general increase in freight rates may impact the company s margins to the extent that its contracts do not permit it to pass the increase through to its customers 
the company is highly leveraged 
as of december   the company s debt structure consisted of a million revolving loan  million term loan  million second lien term loan and million of publicly held senior subordinated notes 
as of december   the company had million borrowed under the revolving loan  million outstanding on letters of credit and was fully drawn on the other instruments 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million 
on february   the company completed a refinancing which consisted of the sale of million of senior secured floating rate notes due senior notes and entered into a new four year million senior secured asset based revolving credit facility credit agreement 
the proceeds  net of expenses  from the refinancing were used to repay amounts outstanding under the revolving loan and two term loans 
in connection with the repayment and termination of these facilities  the company incurred approximately million of prepayment penalties 
the company s previously issued million of publicly held senior subordinated notes 
table of contents were not refinanced 
the credit agreement is limited to a borrowing base calculated based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
the credit agreement contains customary affirmative  financial and negative covenants relating to its operations and its financial condition 
the financial covenants require the company to maintain a minimum level of available credit of million and a minimum interest coverage ratio to be tested only when available credit is less than million  and imposes maximum capital expenditures 
as of march   the company had borrowings under the credit agreement of million and had additional availability of million 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the combined and consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and relationship with crown constar was a wholly owned subsidiary of crown from until the closing of constar s initial public offering on november  at december   crown owned  shares  or approximately  of the company s common stock

impairment of goodwill effective january   constar adopted the provisions of the financial accounting standards board s fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill and certain intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite useful life 
instead  sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite useful life be reviewed for impairment upon adoption of sfas no 
and annually thereafter unless changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill should be reviewed for impairment 
under sfas no 
 goodwill is deemed to be potentially impaired if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
during the second quarter of  constar completed its transitional impairment review of identified reporting units and recognized an impairment charge in its european reporting unit of approximately million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of january  due to the trading price of the company s common stock  operating results that reflect lower volumes of domestic conventional product sales  increased handling and shuttling costs and other factors  the company determined that a goodwill impairment existed as of june  based on a preliminary assessment  the 
table of contents company recognized an estimated impairment charge of million in the second quarter of the fair value of the company was determined by quoted market prices of the company s common stock plus a control premium 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company performed a detailed analysis of the fair value of the company s assets and liabilities  including obtaining appraisals for fixed assets and intangibles  during the third quarter of based on the results of that analysis  the company was not required to make any adjustments to the estimated impairment charge of million as recorded during the second quarter ended june  there was no impairment of goodwill in restructuring and asset impairments in september  the company announced its plan to implement a cost reduction initiative under which it closed two facilities in the north american region 
under this plan  approximately positions were eliminated at the affected facilities and certain production assets at these locations were relocated to other manufacturing facilities 
as a result of this initiative  the company recognized restructuring provisions of million and non cash asset impairment charges of million during the restructuring provisions consisted of approximately million for severance and termination benefits for both facilities and approximately million for contract and lease termination costs 
during  the company recognized an additional million restructuring charge to account for the change in expected lease costs relating to the birmingham facility  which now excludes sublease income 
see note of the accompanying notes to combined and consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
acquisition on september   the company acquired certain manufacturing assets from carolina packaging  inc and entered into a ten year supply agreement with privately held pepsi bottler carolina canners  inc carolina canners for million 
based on final asset appraisals  the entire purchase price was allocated amongst the machinery and equipment acquired in this transaction 
in addition  the company agreed to purchase on hand inventory of approximately million  which was used to supply carolina canners subsequent to the acquisition

basis of presentation net sales the company recognizes revenue from product sales when the goods are shipped and the title and risk of loss pass to the customer 
provisions for discounts and rebates to customers  returns  and other adjustments are netted against sales in the same period that the related sales are recorded 
pet containers can be sold either as finished bottles or as preforms 
preforms are test tube shaped intermediate products in the manufacturing process for bottles and are purchased by customers or other pet container manufacturers that operate equipment to convert preforms into bottles 
unit selling prices for preforms are lower than unit selling prices for corresponding finished bottles because of their lower added value 
in the united states  the company s customers typically buy finished bottles  while its european customers typically buy preforms 

table of contents from year to year  the composition of the company s portfolio of products sold changes significantly due to changes in the company s customer base  changes in the mix of products presented to the marketplace by its customers  and by incremental opportunities for preform sales 
greater proportions of larger  heavier or more specialized bottles will lead to higher net sales  even if total unit volumes remain stable 
many of the company s products have seasonal demand characteristics typically resulting in higher sales and profits in the second and third quarters compared to the first and fourth quarters 
sales of single service convenience beverage bottles are strongest in the summer months 
in  the company experienced unusually low seasonal demand due to poor weather  slow economic conditions and disruptions in the turkish market as a result of the threat of war 
during the first half of  the company experienced lower shipments of conventional products and increased competitive pricing conditions which were partly offset by increased sales of custom products and the contractual pass through to customers of higher resin prices 
in addition  unfavorable weather conditions exacerbated the lower domestic demand for the company s conventional products 
some potential high growth product categories are developed first in conjunction with seasonal promotions and in stadium and special events markets 
all of constar s sales are subject to marketing actions taken by customers as they adjust their mix of product presentations 
the potential for continued conversion to pet from metal  glass and other packaging materials is an important determinant of future demand in the company s industry 
constar believes that the potential for continued conversions to pet is significant 
as is common in its industry  the company s contracts are generally requirements based  granting it all or a percentage of the customer s actual requirements for a particular period of time  instead of a specific commitment of unit volume 
substantially all of constar s sales are made under contracts that allow for the pass through of changes in the price of pet resin  our principal raw material and a major component of cost of goods sold 
when the company adjusts its prices under these agreements to pass through changes in resin prices  its net sales change accordingly but its gross margin is unaffected 
in the aggregate  the lag between effective date of resin price changes and the effective date of price adjustments to its customers under various pass through mechanisms is approximately equal to the company s inventory exposure 
in  approximately of the company s net sales were recorded in currencies other than in us dollars 
because sales denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars in constar s financial statements using the average exchange rates for the period  net sales reported in its financial statements that are denominated in foreign currencies will fluctuate as a result of variations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 
cost of products sold  excluding depreciation cost of products sold  excluding depreciation includes raw material costs  principally pet resin  other direct and indirect manufacturing costs and shipping and handling costs 
pet resin is the largest component of cost of products sold 
the prices the company pays for pet resin are subject to frequent fluctuations resulting from cost changes in the raw materials for pet  which are affected by prices of oil and its derivatives in the us and overseas markets  normal supply and demand influences  and seasonal demand effects 
direct and indirect manufacturing costs include labor costs  electricity and other utilities  product handling and storage costs  maintenance expense and other fixed and variable expenses required to operate the company s plants 
the company s cost of products sold also includes expenses for the engineering  production control and manufacturing administration activities that support plant operations 
depreciation property  plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis for financial reporting purposes over the estimated useful lives of the assets  ranging from to years 
typical depreciation periods are years for molds  years for machinery and equipment and years for buildings 

table of contents gross profit the company defines gross profit as net sales less cost of products sold and depreciation expense 
as discussed above  the company s agreements with customers typically have provisions that insulate gross profit from changes in resin prices by allowing the company to pass those changes through to its customers with equivalent price changes for its products 
important determinants of profitability are volume  product mix  and competitive pricing in relation to resin cost 
volume is significant because the capital intensity of pet bottle manufacturing and the highly automated manufacturing process make fixed overhead costs a high percentage of cost of products sold excluding raw materials 
constar s various products have widely different proportions of variable cost in relation to fixed cost because of their different sizes and weights and because of the different technologies and machine types used to manufacture them 
this results in significant differences in the volume effect on profitability for different products 
generally  larger  heavier  and more technologically specialized bottles have higher overhead absorption rates  and therefore have proportionately greater effect on gross profit when volumes vary from period to period 
although price pass through mechanisms can generally protect profits from short term changes in the market price for resin  it is largely the competitive conditions in the market for the company s products that ultimately determine the selling prices for its products 
also important to the company s profitability is its ability to operate its plants and distribution system efficiently 
the company operates most of its equipment seven days per week and hours per day  with a formal program for scheduled weekly  monthly  and annual preventative maintenance activities 
constar s ability to operate equipment at high output levels and with low unscheduled downtime affects its profitability directly as a result of labor efficiency and the cost of additional freight if product must be shipped from more distant plants to meet commitments to its customers 
the company ships mostly full truckload quantities to its customers using commercial carriers 
because resin represents a large component of cost of products sold and since the company typically passes through changes in resin prices to its customers  constar believes that period to period comparisons of its gross profit as a percent of net sales may not accurately reflect performance  as changes in net sales caused by changes in resin prices will not change gross profit 
during periods when resin costs are high the company s net sales will tend to rise but there will be little effect on gross profit 
the opposite is true during periods of low resin pricing  the company s net sales will tend to be lower with little or no decrease in gross profit  causing gross margins to increase 
selling and administrative expense this includes compensation and related expenses for employees in the selling and administrative functions as well as other operating expenses not directly related to manufacturing or research  development and engineering activities 
it does not include depreciation and amortization charges 
crown historically provided the company with certain centrally managed services as discussed below in the management charges section 
charges for these services are classified as management charges through the closing of the company s initial public offering on november  since the closing date  the company has fulfilled these services with internal resources  third parties  or through its services agreement with crown 
management charges prior to the closing of the company s initial public offering on november   crown charged the company certain management fees for payroll  benefits administration  purchasing  information systems and other centrally managed services 
the cost of these services was directly charged and or allocated to the company using a method that crown and the company believed was reasonable 
such charges were not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have been incurred if the company had been a separate entity 
constar s financial results reflect these management charges through the closing of the company s initial public 
table of contents offering on november  since november   the company has provided these services with its own resources or continued to receive them through its services agreement with crown 
all expenses for these services are included in administrative expense 
research and technology expense prior to the closing of the company s initial public offering on november   the company paid cck technologies  a wholly owned subsidiary of crown  a charge approximately equal to of sales 
in return  cck technologies provided the company with access to cck technologies intellectual property related to pet  paid for the company s direct costs of research  development and engineering activities  provided the company with legal services for the defense of rights for existing technologies  and provided the company with support for customer claims resolution  supplier qualifications  spoilage reduction  and product and material specifications 
as of november   this arrangement was discontinued  and the company s requirements were thereafter met by hiring pet research and development staff from crown  by outsourcing with unrelated third party providers  and through a research and development agreement with cck technologies 
during the third quarter of  the company ceased outsourcing research and technology to cck technologies 
interest expense prior to the closing of the company s initial public offering on november   crown charged the company interest based on the average actual interest costs to crown on the net average intercompany indebtedness 
the company believes that the methodology used to calculate this charge was reasonable but not necessarily indicative of interest expense that would have been incurred if the company had been a standalone entity 
subsequent to the company s initial public offering  interest expense reflects the increase in average debt outstanding pertaining to the revolving credit facility  term loan b  second lien term loan and the senior subordinated notes 
other expenses  net other expenses  net include operating expenses not included elsewhere  such as write offs pertaining to property  plant and equipment  and bad debt expense offset against income items such as legal settlements and gains on sales of used equipment 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate on income or loss was in compared to in a reconciliation of the provision for income taxes and the amount of income tax determined by applying the us federal statutory rate of to pretax income or loss is presented in note to the accompanying combined and consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the accompanying combined and consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require that management make numerous estimates and assumptions 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions  impacting the reported results of operations and financial position of the company 
the company s significant accounting principles are more fully described in note to the combined and consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies  however  are considered to be critical in that i they are most important to the depiction of the company s financial condition and results of operations and ii their application requires management s most subjective judgment in making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
on an annual basis  or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired  the company performs an impairment review by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  to its carrying value 
the impairment review involves a number of assumptions and judgments including the 
table of contents identification of the appropriate reporting units and the calculation of fair value 
the company uses its stock price plus a control premium to calculate fair value 
if the company s share price and operating results sustain an extended decline  this could trigger an impairment review 
the company s estimates of future cash flows includes assumptions concerning future operating performance  economic conditions  and technological changes and may differ from actual future cash flows 
during the second quarter of  the company recognized an impairment charge of million due to the trading price of the company s common stock  operating results that reflected lower volumes of domestic conventional product sales  increased handling and shuttling costs  and other factors 
long lived assets  which consist primarily of machinery and equipment and buildings  are depreciated over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
such circumstances would include items such as a significant decrease in the market price of long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the manner which the asset is being used or in its physical condition or a history of operating cash flow losses associated with use of the asset 
when such events or changes occurs  the company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use and  if applicable  the eventual disposition of the assets 
the key variables that the company must estimate include assumptions regarding future sales volume  prices and other economic factors 
significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables  and they include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events 
if such assets are considered impaired  they are written down to fair value as appropriate 
accounting for pensions and postretirement benefit plans requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding numerous factors  including discount rate  rate of return on plan assets  compensation increases  health care cost increases  mortality and employee turnover 
actual results may differ from the company s actuarial assumptions  which may have an impact on the amount of reported expense or liability for pensions or postretirement benefits 
the rate of return assumption is reviewed at each measurement date based on the pension plans investment policies and an analysis of the historical returns of the capital markets  adjusted for current interest rates as appropriate 
for  the company is using an expected rate of return on plan assets of in the us which is unchanged from the discount rate is developed at each measurement date by reference to published indices of high quality bond yields 
a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets would have changed us pension expense by approximately  a change in the discount rate would have changed us pension expense by approximately  and postretirement expense by approximately  the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
allowances for doubtful accounts are based on historical experience and known factors regarding specific customers 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
the company writes down its inventories for estimated slow moving and obsolete goods by amounts equal to the difference between the carrying cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method under which deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and operating losses and tax credit carry forwards 
the effect on deferred taxes for a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
management provides valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets for amounts  which are not considered more likely than not to be realized 

table of contents the company maintains reserves for estimated costs associated with its workers compensation and health insurance liabilities 
the company is self insured for health insurance 
the company s insurers are the direct payors of workers compensation claims and the company is obligated to reimburse the insurers for any payments made 
the company utilizes historical experience and recent expense rates to estimate the reserves necessary for these areas 
if an increased level of claims in excess of current estimates were to occur  additional reserves would be required 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued a revised version of fin no 
 consolidation of certain variable interest entities vies  which is an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
 consolidated financial statements 
fin no

net cash used for financing activities was million in reflecting decreased borrowings under the revolver loan  the scheduled quarterly payments on the term b loan and the change in outstanding cash overdrafts 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in reflecting decreased borrowings under the revolver loan offset by financing obtained in the form of a million second lien loan

the company s borrowings under the new credit agreement and senior notes bear interest rates based on either a floating rate base rate or the libor rate

generally  the company intends to purchase new equipment only after entering into long term customer contracts that justify additional capacity 
a single high speed production unit costs approximately million and investments may occur in increments of two  three or more production units 
it is constar s experience from previous large scale conversions to pet bottles that whole product lines generally convert at once in conjunction with regional or national marketing campaigns 
the company s customers require an ability to meet timelines for commitment of capacity expansion and implementation of project plans 
additionally  because of the large volumes controlled by the major consumer product companies that are its customers  many of the capacity investments the company makes may be fully or largely committed to agreements with only one customer each 
constar s ability to make capital expenditures is limited by the financial covenants contained in its new credit agreement 
these financial covenants impose maximum capital expenditures of million in  million in  million in and million in these covenants allow for the carry forward of a certain amount of spending below the covenant levels in previous periods 
equipment suppliers to the company s industry have continually made improvements in output and performance at lower capital cost per unit of output 
subject to demand for the capacity  the company seeks to 
table of contents maintain and improve its competitive cost position by acquiring state of the art equipment that has the lowest operating and capital cost per unit of output on each occasion that the company increases capacity

the company has no other accruals for environmental matters

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk in the normal course of business  constar is exposed to fluctuations in currency values  interest rates  commodity prices and other market risks 
the company derived approximately of total revenues from sales in foreign currencies during the year ending december  in the company s financial statements operating results in local currency are translated into us dollars based on average exchange rates during the period and balance sheet items are translated at rates on the balance sheet date 
during periods of a strengthening dollar  the company s us dollar financial results related to operations conducted in foreign currencies are reduced because the local currency amounts are translated into fewer us dollars 
conversely  as the dollar weakens  the company s foreign results reported in us dollars will increase accordingly 
approximately of total revenues in were derived from sales in turkey 
these sales were made in turkish lira and the invoiced sale prices are adjusted to account for fluctuations in the exchange rate between the lira and the dollar 
the company is exposed to fluctuations in such exchange rate from the date of the invoice until settlement 
the company may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on assets  liabilities  firm commitments and anticipated transactions 
however  constar does not generally hedge its exposure to translation gains or losses on non us net assets because it reinvests the cash flows within the operations where they are generated 
at december   there were no foreign currency derivatives outstanding 
the company s borrowings under the new credit agreement and senior notes bear floating interest rates based on either a base rate or the libor rate 
therefore  the company has an exposure to interest rate risk 
the definitive extent of the company s interest rate risk in connection with these loan facilities is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and borrowing requirements 
the principal raw materials used in the manufacture of the company s products are resins that are petrochemical derivatives 
the markets for these resins are cyclical  and are characterized by fluctuations in supply  demand and pricing 
substantially all of constar s sales are made under contracts that allow for the pass through of changes in the price of resin  our principal raw material and a major component of cost of goods sold 
when the company adjusts its prices under these agreements to pass through changes in resin prices  its net sales change accordingly but its gross profit is unaffected 
in the aggregate  the lag between effective date of resin price changes and the effective date of price adjustments to its customers under various pass through mechanisms is approximately equal to the company s inventory exposure
