and fremont  california  sq 
ft on august   interland entered into an asset purchase agreement with peer acquisition corp 
peer acquisition and peer network enterprises  inc peer pursuant to which interland sold its dedicated server assets  including its interests in the three data centers 
as part of the peer transaction  interland entered into a series of agreements with peer to provide for a transition of key services and vendor relationships and to provide for the ongoing colocation of interland s remaining server assets and operations  including a colocation services agreement  an administrative services agreement and a server support agreement collectively  the peer transition agreements 
under the administrative services agreement  interland provides peer with various accounting  communications  administrative and related services  including the effective use of approximately employees 
peer has the option to hire all or some of the employees during a day period and reimburses interland for the expense of the employees 
interland is obligated to provide certain additional accounting  communications  administrative and related services  for an hourly fee  for a period of approximately six months 
under the interland network services agreement  interland is obligated to permit peer to have the beneficial use of certain bandwidth and internet access agreements that interland has for a limited period of time 
peer has indicated that it expects to discontinue its use of these services on or before november  interland provides service to peer under the interland network services agreement at cost 
after peer transitions the data centers to its own bandwidth and network connectivity providers  interland will begin to utilize that bandwidth and network connectivity under the peer network services agreement  at rates that are competitive for large volume purchasers like interland 

table of contents under the colocation agreement and the server support agreement  peer will provide interland with access to portions of the data centers  certain of the servers located there  and support services for those servers that support interland s shared hosting products and interland s corporate servers 
interland expects to continue to use these services for a period of at least one year and expects to continue to pay fees of approximately  per month for these services 
this amount is expected to decline over time as interland reduces the number of servers subject to the agreements through consolidation and the implementation of more efficient shared hosting platforms 
the colocation services agreement requires peer to provide minimum service levels and both the colocation services agreement and the server support agreement permit interland to remove its servers at any time to a new colocation provider after one year 
the colocation agreement and server support agreement do not contain any minimum requirements for interland 
data centers as of august   the company does not operate any data centers 
all of its accounts are colocated in peer s data centers 
proprietary technology many of the products interland sells to customers rely on hardware and software technologies provided to interland by third parties under license 
certain interland products and services combine these third party technologies with technologies that are proprietary to interland interland proprietary technology 
interland proprietary technology may be protected by patent law  copyright law  trade secret law and other forms of intellectual property protection 
see intellectual property  page 
the interland proprietary technology includes technologies that enable the company to automate a number of back end functions and technologies that allow customers to order  change and manage their web hosting accounts easily online without technical expertise 
some interland proprietary technologies are unique and may not legally be practiced by competitors without a license from the company 
although the company believes that its suite of proprietary technologies offers customers significant benefits  the company does not believe that its proprietary technologies are sufficient to deter competitors from providing competing products and services 
network operations centers interland continuously monitors its network operations with technical experts in windows and linux operating platforms 
the network operations center personnel monitor each piece of equipment  including routers  switches and servers  as well as all internet and communication connections 
the network operations centers are designed to allow engineers  administrators  and support staff to continually monitor all systems and to be promptly alerted to abnormalities 
the company has procedures designed to rapidly resolve technical problems that arise 
international revenues interland s international revenues totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
international revenues are denominated and paid in us dollars and represent revenues from international customers generated and supported in the us the company has no operations outside of the united states 
competition interland believes that the primary competitive factors in the technical aspects of its business are usability  reliability  technical support and price 
although the market is intensely competitive  the company believes that it compares favorably with its competition on these factors 
in the smb market  the company believes that the critical success factor is the ability to enable business owners to use their website to attract potential clients  make sales  and service their clients 
pricing in the technical segment is subject to heavy competitive pressure and competitors have even offered such services at a dramatically reduced price  or even for free  as a means of acquiring market share or of fostering market awareness 
the company believes that promotional pricing by competitors will continue  however  the costs of providing reliable service and effective technical and customer support will ultimately be reflected in market prices 
nonetheless  relatively low prices are likely to continue to be available for very basic service  and customers who only require a minimal web presence can be expected to often be lost to competitors whose cost structures and prices are based on providing rudimentary service 
the smb hosting market is highly fragmented with a large number of competitors  most of which have market share of less than 
a number of these companies offer web hosting in addition to their core products and services 
current and potential competitors in the market include web hosting service providers  applications hosting providers  internet service providers  telecommunications companies  large information technology firms that provide a wide array of information technology services  computer hardware suppliers and internet centric companies 
some of the company s most prominent competitors include yahoo  earthlink  ntt verio  united online  inc  internet  inc

table of contents intellectual property interland relies on a combination of laws including patent  copyright  trademark  service mark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary rights in its services 
as of august   the company owned seventeen issued us patents patent patent description system and method for managing server configurations automatically configured network server synchronized server parameter database method and apparatus for facilitating load balancing across name servers dynamically incorporating updates to active configuration information providing user access to dynamic updating of remote configuration information method and apparatus for automatic dial up dial down web hosting method and apparatus for scheduling processes based upon virtual server identifiers computer storage systems for computer facilities method and apparatus for providing a self service file hypermedia authoring and publishing system hypermedia authoring and publishing system continuation of us pat

interland has entered into confidentiality and other agreements with its employees and contractors  including agreements in which the employees and contractors assign their rights in inventions to the company 
interland has also entered into nondisclosure agreements with its suppliers  distributors and some customers in order to limit access to and disclosure of its proprietary information 
nonetheless  neither the intellectual property laws nor contractual arrangements  nor any of the other steps the company has taken to protect its intellectual property can ensure that others will not use its technology  or that others will not develop similar technologies 
interland licenses  or leases from others  many technologies used in its services 
the company expects that it and its customers could be subject to third party infringement claims as the number of websites and third party service providers for web based businesses grows 
although the company does not believe that its technologies or services infringe the proprietary rights of any third parties  the company cannot ensure that third parties will not assert claims against it in the future or that these claims will not be successful 
although it has discontinued operations as a manufacturer of personal computers in the electronics industry  the company is nonetheless subject to litigation arising from its past activities 
it is not uncommon in the electronics industry for patent  trademark and other intellectual property rights claims to be asserted against companies  including component suppliers and personal computer manufacturers 
periodically  the company is made aware that technology it has used in these discontinued operations may have infringed intellectual property rights held by others 
the company has evaluated all such claims and  if necessary and appropriate  sought to obtain licenses for the use of such technology 
if the company or its suppliers were unable to obtain licenses necessary to use intellectual property in its discontinued operations products or processes  it may be legally liable to the owner of such intellectual property 
moreover  even in those instances where the company is justified in denying claims that it has infringed on the intellectual property rights of others  it may nonetheless be forced to defend or settle legal actions taken against the company relating to allegedly protected technology  and such legal actions may require the company to expend substantial funds 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors impairment of interland s intellectual property rights could negatively affect its business or could allow competitors to minimize any advantage that interland s proprietary technology may give it 
government regulation interland is not currently subject to direct federal  state or local government regulation  other than regulations that apply to publicly registered businesses generally

this coverage purportedly applies to any loss sustained as a result of such a claim  including  among other things  damages  judgments  settlements and costs  charges and expenses incurred by the company 
to date  underwriters have denied coverage under the policy for any claims asserted by the plaintiffs in the smith litigation 
as a result  the company has filed a lawsuit against underwriters in state court in idaho see interland  inc v 
certain underwriters at lloyd s of london  case no 
cv oc district court for the fourth judicial district of idaho  county of ada the lloyd s litigation seeking a declaration that the policy provides coverage for the losses sustained by the company as a result of the claims made in the smith litigation 
the company is seeking in excess of million in damages from underwriters

periodically  the company is made aware that technology it has used may have infringed on intellectual property rights held by others 
the company evaluates all such claims and  if necessary and appropriate  obtains licenses for the use of such technology 
if the company or its suppliers are unable to obtain licenses necessary to use intellectual property in the applicable products or processes  it may be forced to defend legal actions taken against it relating to allegedly protected technology 
the company evaluates all such claims and accrues a liability for the estimated costs of settlement or adjudication of claims for alleged infringement as of the respective dates of the balance sheets included in this report 
the company is also a defendant in a number of other lawsuits seeking lesser amounts  and which the company regards as unlikely to result in any material payment 
the outcome of litigation may not be assured  and despite management s views of the merits of any litigation  or the reasonableness of its estimates and reserves  the company s cash balances could nonetheless be materially affected by an adverse judgment 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  the company believes it has adequately reserved for the contingencies arising from the above legal matters where an outcome was deemed to be probable and the loss amount could be reasonably estimated 
as such  the company does not believe that the anticipated outcome of the aforementioned proceedings will have a materially adverse impact on its results of operations  its financial condition or its cash flows

in addition to mr 
stibel  the company added seymour holtzman as its chairman and alex kazerani and efrem gerszberg to its board 
also in august  the company announced that it sold its dedicated server assets to peer network for million in cash 
this transaction is a key step in its restructuring plan and allows the company to invest in its core lines of business providing websites and online services to small and medium sized businesses and provides added financial flexibility 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations has been prepared by management based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its critical accounting policies and estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation of accounts receivable  property  plant and equipment  long lived assets  intangible assets  and contingencies 
estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
these judgments and estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
revenue recognition revenues from continuing operations through august were primarily generated from shared and dedicated internet web hosting  managed services  e commerce services  applications hosting  domain name registrations  and website development services 
after august   the company no longer provided dedicated web hosting product services 
revenues are recognized as the services are provided 
hosting contracts generally are for service periods ranging from one to twenty four months and sometimes require up front set up fees  which are deferred and recognized ratably over the customers expected service period 
deferred revenues represent the liability for advance billings to customers for services not yet provided 
the company may permit an early termination of a term contract subject to penalties 

table of contents valuation of accounts receivable judgment is required when the company assesses the likelihood of ultimate realization of recorded accounts receivable  including assessing the likelihood of collection and the credit worthiness of customers 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate or their operating climate were to change  resulting in an impairment of either their ability or willingness to make payments  an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts would be required 
similarly  a change in the payment behavior of customers generally may require an adjustment in the calculation of an appropriate allowance 
each month management reviews customer payment patterns  historical credit card charge backs  customer cancellation trends  and comparative aged receivables balances in order to determine the appropriate amount of allowance for doubtful accounts receivable to record 
the majority of customer payments are made by credit card and all trade receivable balances over days are fully reserved 
additionally  all trade balances days or less are reserved at  with the exception of our large partnership accounts  which was established based on historical data 
the company believes that the current allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is adequate to cover a reasonably expected level of uncollectible accounts receivable as of the balance sheet date 
property  plant  equipment and long lived assets the company utilizes significant amounts of property  plant and equipment in providing service to its customers 
for financial statement reporting purposes  the company uses straight line depreciation for property and equipment over its estimate of their useful lives 
the company uses estimated useful lives of three to seven years for equipment and software 
changes in technology or changes in the intended use of property  plant and equipment may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change 
the company periodically confirms the appropriateness of estimated economic useful lives for each category of property  plant  and equipment 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  the company periodically evaluates goodwill and intangible assets for potential impairment 
the company tests for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets annually and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of goodwill below its carrying amount by determining whether the company s carrying value exceeds its fair value 
fair value is ascertained by using quoted values of the company s stock and by using discounted values of expected future cash flows 
if impairment of carrying value based on estimated future cash flows exists  the company measures the impairment through the use of discounted cash flows 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions  and operational considerations 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that other intangible assets associated with acquired businesses are impaired 
upon completion of the annual assessment  interland recorded a non cash impairment charge of million to remove the remainder of the carrying value of goodwill 
in addition  the company recorded an impairment charge of million for its other intangible assets 
other intangible assets are amortized over an estimate of their period of economic benefit 
contingencies the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to lawsuits and other legal and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes of these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of the loss accrual required  if any  for these contingencies  is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the company consults with legal counsel and other experts where necessary to assess any contingencies 
the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
discontinued operations during fiscal  the company discontinued the operations of its pc systems and spectek business segments 
these segments have been accounted for as discontinued operations in accordance with apb no 
reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions apb  and in this regard an estimate of all retained liabilities was recorded 
the amounts recorded as of the subsequent reported balance sheet dates represent the estimated remaining liabilities 
these amounts are subject to final settlement  which could result in a revision to the estimated loss on the final disposal of these discontinued operations 

table of contents restructuring and acquisition related liabilities the company has remaining reserves related to its restructuring program approved and implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal year in connection with their acquisition of interland ga 
the company also incurred liabilities related to the integration of acquired business during fiscal and these remaining liabilities represent our estimate of future lease payments for data centers and office facilities being exited that cannot be recovered through subleases 
future events may result in adjustments of these estimates 
results of continuing operations the company s consolidated financial information presents the net effect of discontinued operations separate from the results of the company s continuing operations 
historical financial information has been reclassified to consistently separate and present the results of discontinued operations  and the discussion and analysis that follow generally focuses on continuing operations

sale of accounts hostcentric shared accounts and related assets on may   the company entered into an asset purchase agreement the agreement with caird corporation the buyer  pursuant to which the buyer purchased from interland approximately  shared web hosting customer accounts  together with related equipment  trademarks  domain names  and miscellaneous assets 
the company decided that these customers were unlikely purchasers of the company s marketing oriented services and products  but were rather interested in obtaining mere technical hosting a service which the company believes caird provided more efficiently 
in particular  the shared hosting accounts sold consisted of both shared hosting accounts that were part of the hostcentric acquisition in june as well as accounts for customers who purchased shared hosting services under the hostcentric brand thereafter collectively  the accounts 
many of the accounts were acquired by hostcentric pre merger pursuant to a reseller plan which  after an initial payment  offered additional accounts at a deeply discounted price 
substantially all of the sold accounts were serviced through the company s leased facility in orlando  florida and were never integrated into the company s ticketing and hosting platform due to the different billing structure and processes of these accounts 
the company determined that the migration of these accounts into its billing and hosting platforms could result in significant breakage and a corresponding decline in customer satisfaction 
the company closed the orlando facility in the fourth quarter and terminated employees in connection with that closure 
the total purchase price for the accounts was million  which was received at closing  less commissions and deferred revenue adjustments 
as a result of the sale  the company recognized a net gain of million  net of transaction costs in connection with the sale  which was recorded in gain on sale of accounts of the income statement

the sale of assets  and the accompanying assignment of lease obligations for the atlanta  miami and fremont data centers  together with the transfer and termination of approximately employees no longer required for the operation of the dedicated server assets will allow the company to focus better on its web hosting business and decrease the company s fixed costs

million of the proceeds was received by the company in september million is being held in escrow pursuant to an escrow agreement signed at closing to secure interland s indemnification obligations under the asset purchase agreement 
the escrow agreement will continue for a period of one year after the closing 
at the end of that period  if there are no pending indemnification claims  the escrow balance will be released to interland

account cancellations occur as a result of a customer action  b termination by the company for non payment  or c termination by the company as a result of a decision to no longer provide a particular service 
the million  or  decline in hosting revenue from to is primarily attributable to account cancellations of million and the sale of the hostcentric accounts in may  which were partially offset by growth in revenue of million obtained through a new channel reseller agreement with an internet yellow page provider 
the million  or  decline in hosting revenues from to was related to account cancellations  net of new customers obtained through sales and marketing activities  partially offset by the growth in hosting revenues attributable to the hostcentric acquisition

these accounts produced approximately million in revenue in prior to the sale 
in august  interland sold approximately  dedicated web server accounts to an unrelated buyer 
for the year ended august  these accounts produced approximately million in revenues 
consequently  as a result of these actions the company expects a significant reduction in hosting revenues for the next fiscal year 

table of contents other revenues are primarily comprised of consulting  bandwidth transfer overage billings  colocation services  and web based business solution services 
other revenues decreased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal and increased from million in fiscal the million  or  decline in other revenues from to is primarily attributable to hostcentric colocation accounts that canceled or reduced their monthly billing rate and a decline in bandwidth overage usage

the million  or  decrease from to was primarily related to the company s restructuring and integration efforts reducing bandwidth connectivity cost and operating lease costs 
the company supported a number of technical platforms  which it acquired from other companies 
compared to a single uniform platform  this situation imposed higher costs because of the need for specialized personnel for both operations and technical support  and in the duplication of effort to make changes to the user interface or operating support system 
under the terms of the sale of dedicated assets  there will be a transition period during which peer will gradually assume the full operation of the data centers 
during the transition period  the company will assist peer and be paid for its time and expenses 
the transition period is expected to last approximately six months 
in addition  in connection with the sale  the company entered into a series of agreements under which the company may continue to have access to portions of the data centers and certain servers located there  and receive support services from peer interland expects to continue to use these services for a period of at least one year and to pay fees of approximately  per month to the buyer for these services

partially offsetting these decreases was a million increase in legal fees  a million increase in professional fees  and a million increase in occupancy costs associated with office consolidation 
the million or decrease from to was primarily due to a million decrease in employee related cost  a million decrease in professional fees  and a million reduction in occupancy costs associated with office consolidation 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase of million increase in legal fees and million increase in insurance expenses  which included a one time payment of million for d o side a coverage 
bad debt expense bad debt expense decreased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal  which had decreased from million in fiscal the company s bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues decreased to during fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal this million or decrease from to is directly attributable to the implementation of more aggressive collection strategies and more stringent non paying account deactivation termination policies 
generally services are suspended when an account becomes thirty days past due and services are terminated if an account ages beyond sixty days 
bad debt expense has been decreasing each quarter as the company s churn has reduced  and as its collection policies took effect 
the million or decrease from to was attributable to a decline in customer write offs due to our more stringent collection and customer account termination policies for non payment  resulting in a lower trade accounts balance 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses decreased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the company s depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to during fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal the million or decrease from to is due to continued decline in capital expenditures  the expiration of capital leases during fiscal year and the million write off of intangible assets during fiscal year the million or decrease from to was attributable to charges in of million in accelerated depreciation and amortization on the assets associated with closed data centers in seattle  los angeles and kansas city and software products acquired through business combinations 
restructuring and facility exit costs restructuring expense increased to million in from million in and down from million in the company s restructuring and facility exit costs as a percentage of revenues increased to during fiscal from in fiscal and down from in fiscal the million or increase from to relates to new bandwidth contract termination fees of million and the revision of estimates of the restructuring plans currently in place  which are noted in further detail in the footnotes of the financial statements see footnote restructuring and facility exit costs 
table of contents the million or decrease from to is primarily due to fewer restructuring activities 
in march  the company decided to change its approach to distributing its mainstream market hosting solutions from reliance upon a direct field sales force to an indirect channel approach 
due to this decision  the company implemented a restructuring program to reduce its cost structure 
these restructuring charges include costs of million related to lease commitments  and million employee severance and benefits 
the company reduced its reserves related to bandwidth contract obligations from its plan by million as a result of continued negotiations 
the company also increased its reserves under the restructuring plan of by million related to lease abandonment obligations as a result of changes in the company s sublease expectations and landlord requirements 
in  the company approved and initiated a program to exit certain facilities and consolidate those operations into other existing facilities 
this restructuring plan was part of management s continued plan to streamline the company s operations and to reduce the long term operating costs 
the plan provided for the closure of three data center facilities  a reduction of those related workforces of approximately employees  and the termination of bandwidth and data connectivity contracts in place at these and other facilities 
the company exited all three data centers by june and recorded a charge of approximately million 
the plan charges consisted of million in lease termination costs  million in bandwidth termination costs  million in employee termination benefits  and in fixed asset related charges 
these plan charges were partially offset by million of various adjustments  including the settlement of certain data connectivity contract obligations for amounts less than the original estimates 
there was a charge for million to property  plant and equipment representing the write down of remaining book value of fixed assets originally written down to their estimated salvage value included in the restructuring charge recorded in plan charges 
also during fiscal  the plan was adjusted in connection with the bandwidth settlements as the early termination costs reserves were reduced by million and lease abandonment liabilities were also reduced by million related to the plan 
goodwill impairment as of may  in accordance with the requirements of sfas  the company completed its final goodwill impairment test which entailed comparing the aggregate market value of the company s outstanding securities plus its liabilities to the aggregate carrying value of the company s assets  including goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets 
the company s market price of its stock has experienced significant volatility over the last fiscal year and closed as of may   with a market value significantly less that the value at the beginning of the fiscal year 
management retained valuation specialists to assist in the valuation of its tangible and identifiable intangible assets for purposes of determining the implied fair value of goodwill at may  upon completion of the annual assessment  interland recorded a non cash impairment charge of million in fiscal to write off the remaining balance of the carrying value of goodwill 
this compares to a charge of million reduction in fiscal for the company s impairment test as of may  there was no comparative charge for intangible asset impairment the company s aggressive acquisition strategy during and resulted in significant accumulated customer and product related intangible asset balances 
the company continues to monitor the performance of these acquired identifiable intangible assets and during the third quarter of  the company determined that the related discounted present value of future cash flows from its interliant  at t and burlee customer account acquisitions  as well as customer relationship intangible assets from its communitech 
net  innerhost and dialtone acquisitions were materially less than previously estimated  due primarily to customer cancellations and company initiated account terminations 
as a result of this assessment  the company determined that these identifiable intangible assets were worth less than their carrying value  and the company consequently recorded a non cash impairment charge of million to reduce the asset value to its newly assessed value and a million charge for disposal of software 
this compares to a charge of million in fiscal for the company s impairment test as of may  there was no impairment charge recorded during the year ended august  interest income expense  net interest income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and from million in fiscal the company s interest income expense  net as a percentage of revenues  increased to during fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal interest income expense  net consists of interest income earned on the company s combined cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted investments less interest expense on debt  primarily capital leases 
the cause for the change in net interest expense is primarily due to the reduction in interest expense relating to the maturing and termination of debt and leases for capital equipment during fiscal gain on sale of accounts the gain on sale of accounts was million for the year ended august  compared to no activity in and the gain is attributable to the sale of hostcentric shared accounts  the dedicated customer accounts  and their respective related assets  which are described in more detail in footnote sale of accounts of the attached financial statements 
income tax provision the effective income tax expense rate on continuing operations was approximately for fiscal  compared to an effective income tax benefit rate of for fiscal giving rise to the income tax expense in fiscal is an adjustment to a previously recorded tax benefit receivable 
the effective rates principally reflect the federal statutory rate  net of the effect of state taxes  tax exempt securities and non deductible goodwill amortization  net of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 

table of contents earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda ebitda is defined as net income from continuing operations before i interest income or expense  ii income taxes  and iii depreciation and amortization 
ebitda is not an indicator of financial performance under gaap and may not be comparable to similarly captioned information reported by other companies 
in addition  it does not replace net income loss  operating income loss  or cash flows from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity 
the effect of taxes and interest on interland s net loss is not significant  but depreciation and amortization  primarily as a result of acquisitions  is significant 
the company believes that measuring the performance of the business without regard to non cash depreciation and amortization can make trends in operating results more readily apparent  and when considered with other information  assist investors and other users of the company s financial statements who wish to evaluate the company s ability to generate future cash flows 
the company s ebitda was positive million for fiscal compared to a negative million in fiscal  which had decreased from the negative ebitda of million loss in fiscal the primary cause for the increased ebitda during fiscal was the final goodwill impairment of million and million intangible asset impairment charges that were recorded in may and goodwill impairment of million and million intangible asset impairment in may compared to no impairments during may the following table reflects the calculation of ebitda from continuing operations and a reconciliation to net cash provided by used in operating activities for the fiscal year ended august  august  august  net loss depreciation and amortization interest expense income income tax expense benefit discontinued operations ebitda interest income expense provision for bad debts gain on sale of accounts gain loss on the sale of assets goodwill and asset impairment other non cash adjustments income tax expense benefit changes in assets and liabilities receivables  net income tax recoverable other current assets accounts payable  accrued expenses  and deferred revenue net cash provided by used in operating activities

this represents a million or decrease from the total cash and investment position of million at august   which was comprised of million in cash and cash equivalents  million in auction rate securities and million in short and long term restricted investments 
the company also had a receivable for million that was collected in september as of august   the company s total cash and investment position of million represents a million or decrease from the total cash and investment position of million at august  the components of the change in the company s total cash and investment position during fiscal consist of million used to fund operating activities of continuing operations  million used in financing activities of continuing operations  million used to fund discontinued operations  and million provided by investing activities of continuing operations that includes million of net proceeds from sale of accounts  net proceeds of million from auction rate securities  and a million net change of restricted investments  offset by million of equipment and related capital expenditures 
cash used in operating activities of continuing operations decreased million or to million during fiscal from million during fiscal besides the normal working capital fluctuations of receivables  accrued expenses and accounts payable  the decrease in cash used in continuing operations includes the company s continued payout of restructuring initiatives that reduced facility  bandwidth connectivity  and employee related costs but  at a lower rate than the prior year 
it also includes the gain on sale of accounts in the amount of million 
cash provided by investing activities decreased million or to million during fiscal from cash provided by investing activities of million during fiscal the decrease in cash provided by investing activities is primarily related to a decrease in proceeds from investments of million and million increase in auction rate securities purchases  offset by million less of deposits  million less capital expenditures  and the net proceeds of million from the sale of the hostcentric assets in the fourth quarter of  million was delivered to one of the company s issuers of directors and officers liability insurance providing a retention deposit for payment of the company s obligations to indemnify officers and directors in the event that the company does not fulfill its obligations directly 
at such time as the company has fulfilled its obligations  the funds will be returned to the company 

table of contents cash used in financing activities decreased million or to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the decrease in cash used in financing activities is primarily due to a significant reduction in the amount of debt repayments from the prior year due to less capital lease obligations and lower principal debt amounts 
net cash used in discontinued operations decreased million or to million during fiscal from cash used in discontinued operations of million during fiscal the reduction in cash used related to discontinued operations reflects the continued winding down of the computer products and services businesses and lower litigation costs in fiscal in november  the company entered into a settlement agreement that will require a payment of million to settle a pending discontinued operations lawsuit 
on may   interland  inc entered into an asset purchase agreement the agreement with caird corporation the buyer  pursuant to which the buyer purchased from interland certain shared web hosting customer accounts  together with related equipment  trademarks  domain names  and miscellaneous assets accounts 
the company received of the purchase price of million at closing  less costs related to the sale of accounts 
the company made capital expenditures of million during fiscal of which million was for the purchase of servers  data center equipment and related software  and million was investment related expenditures for enhancement of our customer facing systems and security upgrades 
during fiscal the company expects a lower level of investment related to capital expenditures primarily due to the reduction of server and data center equipment purchase requirements with the sale of it dedicated assets 
the company expects to spend somewhere between million and million in capital expenditures in fiscal primarily related to network storage equipment  servers and personal computers 
on july   the company entered into a financing arrangement with us bank under which the company executed a million credit agreement 
during fiscal  the million was paid and the loan was closed 
the payoff of this loan released million of collateralized cash that was pledged under this agreement 
in july  the company entered into a financing arrangement with us bancorp oliver allen technology leasing for a sale and leaseback of up to million for certain equipment  primarily computer hardware 
on february   the company terminated the sale and leaseback agreement and repurchased the assets 
in conjunction with this lease termination the company executed a five year promissory note with us bancorp oliver allen technology leasing for the repurchase amount 
the original sale leaseback agreement required payments of  each month with an end of lease buyout amount in july of approximately million 
the new promissory note bears an interest rate of and requires monthly payments of  over the next five years 
as of august   the principal balance on the promissory note was million 
the company pledged million as collateral for this promissory note  this amount will gradually decrease until the agreement terminates in february as of august   the amount of collateral is million 
these restrictions prevent the company from utilizing the related cash and cash equivalents until all of its obligations under the note are satisfied 
the following table discloses aggregate information about the company s contractual obligations  excluding interest  as of august  and the periods in which payments are due after contractual obligations in thousands total year years years years real property leases long term debt bandwidth commitments contractual obligations operating leases capital leases total commitments the company s web hosting business has historically incurred net losses and losses from operations 
the company s future operation is dependent upon its ability to achieve and sustain positive cash flow prior to the depletion of cash resources 
the company plans to reduce its level of cash requirements through a decrease in capital purchases with the sale of its dedicated accounts and related assets and by improving sales and reducing churn 
the company has also reduced cash outlays for payments associated with prior integration and discontinued operation liabilities and has reduced debt payments because of the buyout of capital lease obligations during the company expects to continue to have negative cash flows as it continues to execute on its business plan 
there can be no assurance that interland s continuing efforts to stabilize or increase its revenue will be successful and the company will be able to continue as a going concern 
if the company is unable to successfully execute its business plan  it may require additional capital  which may not be available on suitable terms 
nonetheless  management believes it has adequate cash and liquid resources to fund operations and planned capital expenditures through the next months 

table of contents reverse stock split the company implemented a for reverse stock split that went into effect as of the close of the market on august  no fractional shares of common stock were issued in connection with the reverse stock split 
in instances where the reverse stock split would result in a shareholder of record becoming a holder of a fractional interest in a share of common stock  the number of shares held by such record shareholder was rounded down to the product of i the closing sales price of the common stock on the effective date of the reverse stock split  multiplied by ii the fractional interest 
stock repurchase program in march  the board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program to acquire outstanding common stock 
under the program  up to million of common stock could be reacquired over the next year 
under this program the company utilized approximately million to buy back approximately  shares of its outstanding stock 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas r  share based payment  sfas r which requires the recognition of cost resulting from transactions in which the company acquires goods and services by issuing its shares  share options  or other equity instruments 
this cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
sfas r applies to awards that are granted  modified or settled in interim or fiscal periods beginning after the effective date 
the adoption of this standard is required for public entities effective as of the beginning of the annual reporting period that starts after june  the company adopted this standard effective september   using the modified prospective method of transition 
this transition method requires that compensation cost be recognized for new awards granted and awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after september  this method also requires us to recognize cost for the unvested portion of all awards issued prior to and outstanding as of september  at the grant date fair value as the remaining requisite service is rendered 
in addition  under sfas no 
r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments and the amortization method for compensation cost 
we are currently assessing the impact of sfas no 
r on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company has committed to grant stock options and will recognize expense with respect to such options in the future 
on july   the board of directors approved and the company granted options to purchase a total of million shares of company common stock to two employees 
the option shares vest and become exercisable at the rate of  shares per month beginning august  on the three year anniversary of the grant date  all unvested shares will vest and become exercisable 
these options are subject to expensing under fas r 
on august   the board of directors adopted the equity incentive plan the plan which was approved by the stockholders on august  the maximum number of shares of stock that may be awarded under the plan is equal to million shares 
off balance sheet arrangements we are currently not engaged in the use of off balance sheet derivative financial instruments  to hedge or partially hedge interest rate exposure nor do we maintain any other off balance sheet arrangements for the purpose of credit enhancement  hedging transactions  or other financial or investment purposes 
directors officers insurance in  the company determined that issuers of directors and officers insurance coverage have become more likely to refuse to defend and pay claims than in the past  and have been aggressively interpreting policy language in an attempt to avoid claims 
the company also recognized that lawsuits brought against public companies have the potential to result in defense costs  settlement or judgments that may exceed the ability of companies to fulfill their customary indemnification obligations to directors and officers 
consequently  individual officers and directors of the company would face exposure to personal liability for the costs of litigation to determine coverage  to defend claims  and to satisfy judgments or settlements  unless supplemental insurance coverage was obtained 
in order to insure this exposure  during the fourth quarter of the company  entered into contracts with two insurers  which together are designed to provide further assurance that the company s indemnification obligations will be satisfied 
the company purchased a policy of directors and officers insurance  which  in the event of the company s inability to pay  will provide broad coverage to individual officers  and directors in these circumstances customarily referred to as side a coverage 
the company paid  for a three year period of coverage beginning on august  for which the associated expense is recognized ratably over the coverage period 
additionally  the company paid  in august  which was expensed in  to cover prior claims and certain potential claims  and delivered million to the insurer to secure the retained exposure 
these held funds are recorded as other assets  and  to the extent they are not exhausted  will be re delivered to the company when exposure to such claims is extinguished by final resolution of such claims 
in each case these policies do not include most customary exclusions  although no director or officer is provided coverage for fraudulent or illegal acts 
as reported in item legal proceedings  the company has not recorded any reserve for any such claims  consistent with the application of sfas  accounting for contingencies 

table of contents risk factors you should carefully consider the following factors and all other information contained in this form k before you make any investment decisions with respect to the company s securities 
the risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only risks the company faces 
interland has incurred losses since inception and could incur losses in the future 
interland has incurred net losses and losses from operations for all but one of each quarterly period from its inception through the fourth quarter of fiscal a number of factors could increase its operating expenses  such as adapting network infrastructure and administrative resources to accommodate additional customers and future growth  developing products  distribution  marketing  and management for the mainstream market  broadening customer technical support capabilities  developing or acquiring new products and associated technical infrastructure  developing additional indirect distribution partners  increased costs from third party service providers  improving network security features  and  legal fees and settlements associated with litigation and contingencies 
to the extent that increases in expenses are not offset by increases in revenues  operating losses will increase 
interland s management and board of directors may be unable to execute their plans to turn around the company  grow its revenues and achieve profitability 
interland has incurred net losses and losses from operations for all but one of each quarterly period from its inception through the fourth quarter of fiscal interland s former chief executive officer  joel j 
kocher  left the company in the last month of fiscal and was replaced by jeffrey m 
stibel as chief executive officer 
at approximately the same time  the company added three new directors to its board of directors 
if the company s new chief executive officer is unable to recruit management talent to execute on the company s plans  or if management and the board of directors are unable to execute on those plans  then the company s plans may be insufficient to grow the company s revenues and achieve profitability 
ours is a recurring revenue subscriber business and as such the effects of a net loss of monthly recurring revenue are magnified 
a large majority of our revenue is derived from monthly recurring charges incurred by owners of hosted websites 
accordingly  the termination of a single account paying per month will affect revenue every month in the future 
the loss of such a customer at the beginning of a fiscal year will result in a twelve fold reduction in revenue for that fiscal year 
absent the addition of customers through acquisitions  interland has consistently incurred a net loss in monthly recurring charges  and this situation may continue with material negative effects on reported revenue and net income 
although reductions in monthly recurring charges may be offset for a time by increases in revenue derived from one time or non recurring charges  the compounding effect of monthly recurring charges losses will almost certainly eventually result in a meaningful reduction of reported revenue 
moreover  because of interland s relatively low percentage of variable costs  a concomitantly high percentage of the amount of revenue loss results in a loss of ebitda and of net income 
there can be no assurance that interland s continuing efforts to stabilize or increase its monthly recurring charges and revenue will be successful 
if revenue continues to decline  the company may eventually require additional capital  which may not be available on suitable terms 
although the company can reduce spending to some degree  there can be no assurance in such an event that the company would be able to continue as a going concern 
unfavorable results of existing litigation may cause interland to have additional expenses or operating losses that exceed the company s ability to pay 
the company is defending a number of matters in active litigation see item  legal proceedings 
the cost of defending lawsuits  regardless of their merit  can be substantial 
the company spent million during to defend lawsuits 
although the company has favorably resolved a number of lawsuits through rulings  verdicts  and minimal settlements  and although the company may be 
table of contents successful in defending ongoing litigation  the costs of defense cannot be expected to be avoided 
the company believes it has appropriately established reserves for the contingency of adverse verdicts in accordance with gaap 
in order for a loss contingency to be reserved for in the financial statements  gaap requires that the information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements 
it is implicit in this condition that it must be probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of the loss and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
therefore  the company has not reserved for all of its pending lawsuits 
consequently lawsuits for which there is no reserve nonetheless pose a risk of substantial loss which would have a material effect on the company s financial position 
additionally  even in those cases where a reserve has been established  the amount of the reserve is necessarily an estimate and the actual result may differ materially 
reserves are established only for the damages that may be assessed  and do not take into account the costs of litigation 
even in those instances where interland may ultimately prevail on appeal  an adverse verdict in a substantial amount may damage the reputation of the company  may require the company to post an appeal bond in an amount which deprives the company of cash  and require additional expenditures for the cost of appeal 
the outcome of litigation is unpredictable  and an adverse final verdict could exceed the company s ability to pay 
because interland s historical financial information is not representative of its future results  investors and analysts will have difficulty analyzing interland s future earnings potential 
because the company has grown through acquisition and its past operating results reflect the costs of integrating these acquisitions  as well as revenues from operations which have now been sold  historical results are not representative of future expected operating results 
the company has recognized very sizeable charges and expenditures in the past for impairment charges  restructuring costs  network enhancements  and exploration of the mainstream market 
because these items are not necessarily recurring  it is more difficult for investors to predict future results 
interland has a limited operating history and its business model is still evolving  which makes it difficult to evaluate its prospects 
interland s limited operating history makes evaluating its business operations and prospects difficult 
its range of service offerings has changed since inception and its business model is still developing 
interland has changed from being primarily a seller of personal computers and related accessories to primarily a provider of web hosting and web based value added business solutions to small and medium sized businesses 
because some of its services are new  the market for them is uncertain 
as a result  the revenues and income potential of its business  as well as the potential benefits of its acquisitions  may be difficult to evaluate 
quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate  which could cause interland s stock price to be volatile 
past operating results have fluctuated significantly on a quarterly and an annual basis 
quarterly and annual operating results may continue to significantly fluctuate due to a wide variety of factors 
because of these fluctuations  comparing operating results from period to period is not necessarily meaningful  and it would not be meaningful to rely upon such comparisons as an indicator of future performance 
factors that may cause the company s operating results to fluctuate include  but are not limited to demand for and market acceptance of the company s services and products  introduction of new services or enhancements by interland or its competitors  costs of implementing new network security features  crm systems  and billing modules  technical difficulties or system downtime affecting the internet generally or its hosting operations specifically  customer retention  increased competition and consolidation within the web hosting and applications hosting markets  changes in pricing policies and the pricing policies of competitors  gains or losses of key strategic partner relationships  impairment charges  restructuring charges  merger and integration costs  
table of contents litigation expenses  insurance expenses  marketing expenses  and seasonality of customer demand interland cannot provide any assurances that it will succeed in its plans to increase the size of its customer base  the amount of services it offers  or its revenues during the next fiscal year and beyond 
in addition  relatively large portions of its expenses are fixed in the short term  and therefore its results of operations are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in revenues 
also  if it cannot continue using third party products in its service offerings  its service development costs could increase significantly 
interland operates in a new and evolving market with uncertain prospects for growth and may not be able to generate and sustain growth in its customer base 
interland operates in a new and evolving market with uncertain prospects for growth and may not be able to achieve and sustain growth in its customer base or to maintain its average revenue per customer account 
the market for web hosting and applications hosting services for small and medium sized businesses  and especially the mainstream market  has only recently begun to develop and is evolving rapidly 
the market for interland s services may not develop further  consumers may not widely adopt its services and significant numbers of businesses or organizations may not use the internet for commerce and communication 
if this market fails to develop further or develops more slowly than expected  or if interland s services do not achieve broader market acceptance  interland will not be able to grow its customer base 
in addition  interland must be able to differentiate itself from its competition through its service offerings and brand recognition 
these activities may be more expensive than interland anticipates  and interland may not succeed in differentiating itself from its competitors  achieving market acceptance of its services  or selling additional services to its existing customer base 
because interland s target markets are volatile  the company may face a loss of customers or a high level of non collectible accounts 
the company intends to continue to concentrate on serving the small and medium sized business market 
this market contains many businesses that may not be successful  and consequently present a substantially greater risk for non collectible accounts receivable and for non renewal 
moreover  a significant portion of this target market is highly sensitive to price  and may be lost to a competitor with a lower pricing structure 
because few businesses in this target market employ trained technologists  they tend to generate a high number of customer service and technical support calls 
the expense of responding to these calls is considerable  and the call volume is likely to increase in direct proportion to revenue  potentially limiting the scalability of the business 
additionally  if the customer becomes dissatisfied with the company s response to such calls  cancellation  non payment  or non renewal becomes more likely 
interland s strategy for minimizing the negative aspects of its target market include capitalizing on infrastructure efficiencies to become a profitable provider at the lowest sustainable price  automating customer care and technical support to reduce the cost per call  and to minimize the time spent by company personnel  intensive training and supervision of customer care and technical support personnel to maximize customer satisfaction  and  increasing the number and breadth of services to differentiate the company from competition 
the company can give no assurance  however  that any of these measures will be successful  and the company s failure to manage these risks could decrease revenues and increase losses 
interland could incur liabilities in the future relating to its pc systems business  which could cause additional operating losses 
interland could incur liabilities from the sale of the pc systems business to gtg pc 
according to the terms of its agreement with gtg pc  interland retained liabilities relating to the operation of the pc systems business prior to the closing of the transaction including liabilities for taxes  contingent liabilities and liabilities for accounts payable accrued prior to the closing 
it also agreed to indemnify gtg pc and its affiliates for any breach of its representations and warranties contained in the agreement for a period of two years  or for the applicable statute of limitations for matters related to taxes 
its indemnification obligation is capped at million 
except for claims for fraud or injunctive relief  this indemnity is the exclusive remedy for any breach of its representations  warranties and covenants contained in the agreement with gtg pc 
accordingly  it could be required in the future to make payments to gtg pc and its affiliates in accordance with the agreement  which could adversely affect its future results of operations and cash flows 
to date it has not had to satisfy any such claims 

table of contents interland could incur liabilities in the future relating to the sale of its dedicated server assets  which could cause additional operating losses 
interland could incur liabilities from the sale of its dedicated server assets to peer networks on august  according to the terms of its agreement with peer networks  interland retained liabilities relating to the operation of the dedicated server assets prior to the closing of the transaction including liabilities for taxes  contingent liabilities and liabilities for accounts payable accrued prior to the closing 
it also agreed to indemnify peer networks and its affiliates for any breach of its representations and warranties contained in the agreement for a period of months  provided  however  that the representations and warranties set forth sections tax matters  erisa matters and intellectual property will survive until days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with extensions  the representations and warranties set forth in section environmental matters will survive until three years following the closing date  and the representations and warranties of the parties set forth in sections authorization  title to assets  business  organization and authorization will survive indefinitely 
its indemnification obligation is capped at sixty percent of the purchase price approximately million 
except for claims for fraud  this indemnity is the exclusive remedy for any breach of its representations  warranties and covenants contained in the agreement with peer networks 
accordingly  it could be required in the future to make payments to peer networks and its affiliates in accordance with the agreement  which could adversely affect its future results of operations and cash flows 
to date it has not had to satisfy any such claims 
because interland faces intense competition  it may not be able to operate profitably in its markets 
the web hosting and applications hosting markets are highly competitive  which could hinder interland s ability to successfully market its products and services 
the company may not have the resources  expertise or other competitive factors to compete successfully in the future 
because there are few substantial barriers to entry  the company expects that it will face additional competition from existing competitors and new market entrants in the future 
many of interland s current and potential competitors have greater name recognition and more established relationships in the industry and greater resources 
as a result  these competitors may be able to develop and expand their network infrastructures and service offerings more rapidly  adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements more quickly  devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their services  and  adopt more aggressive pricing policies than the company can 
current and potential competitors in the market include web hosting service providers  applications hosting providers  internet service providers  telecommunications companies  large information technology firms and computer hardware suppliers 
these competitors may operate in one or more of these areas and include companies such as yahoo  ntt verio  affinity internet  and earthlink 
impairment of interland s intellectual property rights could negatively affect its business or could allow competitors to minimize any advantage that interland s proprietary technology may give it 
the company currently has no patented technology that would preclude or inhibit competitors from entering the web hosting market that it serves 
while it is the company s practice to enter into agreements with all employees and with some of its customers and suppliers to prohibit or restrict the disclosure of proprietary information  the company cannot be sure that these contractual arrangements or the other steps it takes to protect its proprietary rights will prove sufficient to prevent illegal use of its proprietary rights or to deter independent  third party development of similar proprietary assets 
effective copyright  trademark  trade secret and patent protection may not be available in every country in which its products and services are offered 
interland currently is  and in the future may be  involved in legal disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of its intellectual property rights or those of a third party 
intellectual property litigation is typically extremely costly and can be disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel 
in addition  any adverse legal results could subject it to significant liabilities  require it to seek licenses from others  prevent it from using  licensing or selling certain of its products and services  or cause severe disruptions to operations or the markets in which it competes which could decrease profitability 
periodically  interland is made aware of claims  or potential claims  that technology it used in its discontinued operations may have infringed on intellectual property rights held by others 
the company has accrued a liability and charged operations for the estimated costs of settlement or adjudication of several asserted and unasserted claims for alleged infringement relating to its discontinued operations prior to the balance sheet date 
resolution of these claims could be costly and decrease profitability 
if interland is unable to attract and retain key personnel  it may not be able to compete effectively in its market 

table of contents the future success of interland will depend  in part  on its ability to attract and retain key management  technical  and sales and marketing personnel 
the company attempts to enhance its management and technical expertise by recruiting qualified individuals who possess desired skills and experience in certain targeted areas 
the company experiences strong competition for such personnel in the web hosting industry 
the company s inability to retain employees and attract and retain sufficient additional employees  information technology  engineering  and technical support resources could adversely affect its ability to remain competitive in its markets 
the company has faced and may continue to face the loss of key personnel  which could limit the ability of the company to develop and market its products and services 
interland depends on its reseller sales channel to market and sell many of its services 
interland does not control its resellers  and if it fails to develop or maintain good relations with them  it may not achieve the growth in customers and revenues that it expects 
an element of the strategy for the company s growth is to further develop the use of third parties that resell or recommend its services 
many of these resellers are web development or web consulting companies that also sell interland s web hosting services  but that generally do not have established customer bases to which they can market these services 
the company is not currently dependent on any one reseller to generate a significant level of business  but it has benefited and continues to significantly benefit from business generated by the reseller channel 
although interland attempts to provide its resellers with incentives such as price discounts on its services that the resellers seek to resell at a profit  the failure of its services to be commercially accepted in some markets  whether as a result of a reseller s performance or otherwise  could cause its current resellers to discontinue their relationships with the company 
the company also is developing relationships with larger distribution partners  and although the percentage of the company s current revenues generated by any of these relationships is currently small  if the company s strategy is successful  future revenue growth will be dependent on the success and maintenance of these relationships 
interland is vulnerable to system failures  which could harm its reputation  cause its customers to seek reimbursement for services  and cause its customers to seek another provider for services 
the company must be able to operate the systems that manage its network around the clock without interruption 
its operations will depend upon its ability  or that of its service providers  to protect its or their network infrastructure  equipment and customer files against damage from human error  fire  earthquakes  hurricanes  floods  power loss  telecommunications failures  sabotage  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events 
the company s networks are currently subject to various points of failure 
for example  a problem with a router devices that move information from one computer network to another or switches could cause an interruption in the services the company provides to a portion of its customers 
in the past  the company has experienced periodic interruptions in service 
the company has also experienced  and in the future it may continue to experience  delays or interruptions in service as a result of the accidental or intentional actions of internet users  current and former employees  or others 
any future interruptions could cause customers or end users to seek damages for losses incurred  require the company to replace existing equipment or add redundant facilities  damage the company s reputation for reliable service  cause existing customers to cancel their contracts  or make it more difficult for the company to attract new customers 
interland s data centers are maintained by a third party substantially all of the network services and computer servers utilized by interland in its provision of services to customers are housed in data centers owned by other service providers 
in particular  substantially all of interland s servers are housed in the data center in atlanta  georgia that interland sold to peer networks on august  interland obtains internet connectivity for those servers  and for the customers who rely on those servers  in part through direct arrangements with network service providers and in part indirectly through peer networks 
in the future  interland may house other servers and hardware items in facilities owned or operated by other service providers 
a disruption in the ability of one of these service providers to provide service to interland could cause a disruption in service to interland s customers 
a service provider could be disrupted in its operations through a number of contingencies  including unauthorized access  computer viruses  accidental or intentional actions  electrical disruptions  and other extreme conditions 
although interland believes it has taken adequate steps to protect itself through its contractual arrangements with its service providers  interland cannot eliminate the risk of a disruption in service resulting from the accidental or intentional disruption in service by a service provider 
in addition  a service provider could raise its prices or otherwise change its terms and conditions in a way that adversely affects the company s ability to support its customers or financial performance 
data centers and communications networks are vulnerable to security breaches that could cause disruptions in service  liability to third parties  or loss of customers 
table of contents a significant barrier to electronic commerce and communications is the need for secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
some of the company s services rely on security technology licensed from third parties that provides the encryption and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of confidential information 
despite the design and implementation of a variety of network security measures by the company  unauthorized access  computer viruses  accidental or intentional actions and other disruptions could occur 
in addition  inappropriate use of the network by third parties could also potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information  such as credit card and bank account numbers stored in the company s computer systems 
these security problems could result in the company s liability and could also cause the loss of existing customers and potential customers 
although the company continues to implement industry standard security measures  third parties may be able to overcome any measures that it implements 
the costs required to eliminate computer viruses and alleviate other security problems could be prohibitively expensive and the efforts to address such problems could result in interruptions  delays or cessation of service to customers  and harm the company s reputation and growth 
concerns over the security of internet transactions and the privacy of users may also inhibit the growth of the internet  especially as a means of conducting commercial transactions 
disruption of interland s services caused by unknown software or hardware defects could harm its business and reputation the company s service offerings depend on complex software and hardware  including proprietary software tools and software licensed from third parties 
complex software and hardware may contain defects  particularly when first introduced or when new versions are released 
the company may not discover software or hardware defects that affect its new or current services or enhancements until after they are deployed 
although interland has not experienced any material software or hardware defects to date  it is possible that defects may exist or occur in the future 
these defects could cause service interruptions  which could damage its reputation or increase its service costs  cause it to lose revenue  delay market acceptance or divert its development resources 
providing services to customers with critical websites and web based applications could potentially expose interland to lawsuits for customers lost profits or other damages 
because the company s web hosting and applications hosting services are critical to many of its customers businesses  any significant interruption in those services could result in lost profits or other indirect or consequential damages to its customers as well as negative publicity and additional expenditures for it to correct the problem 
although the standard terms and conditions of the company s customer contracts disclaim liability for any such damages  a customer could still bring a lawsuit against it claiming lost profits or other consequential damages as the result of a service interruption or other website or application problems that the customer may ascribe to it 
a court might not enforce any limitations on interland s liability  and the outcome of any lawsuit would depend on the specific facts of the case and legal and policy considerations even if the company believes it would have meritorious defenses to any such claims 
in such cases  it could be liable for substantial damage awards 
such damage awards might exceed its liability insurance by unknown but significant amounts  which would seriously harm its business 
interland could face liability for information distributed through its network 
the law relating to the liability of online services companies for information carried on or distributed through their networks is currently unsettled 
online services companies could be subject to claims under both united states and foreign law for defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement  violation of securities laws or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials distributed through their networks 
several private lawsuits seeking to impose such liability upon other entities are currently pending against other companies 
in addition  organizations and individuals have sent unsolicited commercial e mails from servers hosted by service providers to massive numbers of people  typically to advertise products or services 
this practice  known as spamming  can lead to complaints against service providers that enable such activities  particularly where recipients view the materials received as offensive 
the company may  in the future  receive letters from recipients of information transmitted by its customers objecting to such transmission 
although the company prohibits its customers by contract from spamming  it cannot provide assurances that its customers will not engage in this practice  which could subject it to claims for damages 
in addition  the company may become subject to proposed legislation that would impose liability for or prohibit the transmission over the internet of some types of information 
other countries may also enact legislation or take action that could impose liability on the company or cause it not to be able to operate in those countries 
the imposition upon the company and other online services of potential liability for information carried on or distributed through its systems could require it to implement measures to reduce its exposure to this liability  which may require it to expend substantial resources  or to discontinue service offerings 
the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of these lawsuits and legislative proposals also could affect the rate of growth of internet use 
interland s business operates in an uncertain legal environment where future government regulation and lawsuits could restrict interland s business or cause unexpected losses 
due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet  laws and regulations with respect to the internet may be adopted at federal  state and local levels  covering issues such as user privacy  freedom of expression  pricing  characteristics and quality of products and services  taxation  advertising  intellectual property rights  information security and the convergence of traditional telecommunications services with internet communications 
the company cannot fully predict the nature of future legislation and the manner in which government authorities may interpret and enforce such legislation 
as a result  interland and its customers could be subject to potential 
table of contents liability and expenses under future legislation  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the adoption of any such laws or regulations might decrease the growth of the internet which in turn could decrease the demand for the company s services  or increase the cost of doing business 
in addition  applicability to the internet of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  copyright and other intellectual property issues  taxation  libel  obscenity and personal privacy is uncertain 
these laws generally pre date the advent of the internet and related technologies and  as a result  do not consider or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies 
interland s stock price may be volatile which could cause an investment in its common stock to decrease significantly 
the market price of interland common stock has experienced a significant decline 
the price has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
the following are examples of factors or developments that would likely cause the company s stock price to continue to be volatile variations in operating results and analyst earnings estimates  the volatility of stock within the sectors within which it conducts business  announcements by interland or its competitors regarding introduction of new services  general decline in economic conditions  reductions in the volume of trading in its common stock  and  the company s inability to reduce the rate of account cancellations  or to increase the rate of account additions  or both 
during the weeks ended august  the high and low closing price for interland common stock on nasdaq was and  respectively 
substantial future sales of shares by shareholders could negatively affect interland s stock price 
a number of groups of investors hold substantial numbers of interland shares  including the former shareholders of acquired companies  and hedge funds reported to have investment styles that lead to short term holdings 
substantial sales by these holders may adversely affect interland s stock price 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk substantially all of the company s liquid investments and a majority of its debt are at fixed interest rates  and therefore the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates 
as of august   approximately of the company s liquid investments mature within three months and mature within one year 
the majority of the company s long term debt is comprised of fixed rate capital leases used to finance equipment purchases 
in this regard the underlying debt instruments are not marketable and  therefore  there is no associated market risk 
as of august   management believes the reported amounts of liquid investments and debt to be reasonable approximations of their fair values 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate investment securities will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the portfolio has been primarily comprised of commercial paper rated a p  bank certificates rated aa or better  and corporate medium term notes rated aa or better 
at august   the company s investment portfolio included fixed rate securities with an estimated fair value of million 
the interest rate changes affect the fair market values but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
the fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt exclusive of capital leases is also subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the estimated fair value of the company s long term debt at august  was million

controls and procedures disclosure controls and procedures the company s management  including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the securities exchange act of rules a e  and d e as of august  based on this review  the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that interland s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurances that such disclosure controls and procedures satisfy their objectives and that the information required to be disclosed by the company in its 
table of contents periodic reports is accumulated and communicated to management  including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer  as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure and is recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the us securities and exchange commission s rules and forms 
nevertheless  the company s management  including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer  do not expect that the company s disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within the company have been detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty  and that breakdown can occur because of simple error or mistake 
in particular  many of the company s current processes rely upon manual reviews and processes to ensure that neither human error nor system weakness has resulted in erroneous reporting of financial data 
the company has implemented a number of significant improvements to its internal controls over financial reporting 
the company considers a change in its internal control over financial reporting to be material only when the failure to effectuate such change would have been expected to have resulted in a substantial likelihood of a material misstatement of the company s financial statements 
while we continued to make incremental improvements to our internal controls over financial reporting during the fiscal year  there were no changes in the company s internal control over financial reporting which have materially affected its internal controls 
management s report on internal control over financial reporting the management of interland  inc is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules a f and d f under the securities exchange act of the company s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
a company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
a company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that  in reasonable detail  accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company  ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company  and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition  use  or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 
because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 
also  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 
based on this evaluation  management concluded that interland s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of august  management s assessment of the effectiveness of interland s internal control over financial reporting as of august  has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp  an independent registered public accounting firm  as stated in their report which is included herein
