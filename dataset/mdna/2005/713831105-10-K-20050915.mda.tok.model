item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act if  as amended and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
all statements other than statements of historical fact are forward looking statements for purposes of these provisions  including any statements regarding projections of earnings  statements regarding the future results of ecera  revenues  gross margins or other financial items  plans and objectives of management for future operations  future purchases of capital equipment  future expenditures  potential acquisitions  proposed new products or services and their development schedule  industry  technological or market trends  our ability to address the need for application specific logic products  our ability to respond rapidly to customer needs  expanding product sales  future economic conditions or performance  and any statement of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing 
in some cases  forward looking statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as may  will  expects  plans  anticipates  estimates  potential  or continue  or the negative thereof or other comparable terminology 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements contained herein are reasonable  there can be no assurance that such expectations or any of the forward looking statements will prove to be correct  and actual results could differ materially from those projected or assumed in the forward looking statements 
some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are set forth herein under the heading risk factors factors that may affect operating results in item of this report and elsewhere in this report 
all forward looking statements and reasons why results may differ included in this annual report are made as of the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statement or reason why actual results may differ 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of such statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
our estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that we consider to be reasonable given the circumstances 
actual results may vary from our estimates 
we consider the following accounting policies are critical as defined by the securities and exchange commission  in that they are both highly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require us to make difficult judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 
we also have other important policies that are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our products upon shipment  provided title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the revenue is reasonably assured 
a provision for estimated future returns and other charges against revenue is recorded at the time of shipment 
for the twelve months ended july  the majority of our sales were to distributors 
we sell products to large  domestic distributors at the price listed in our price book for that distributor 
we recognize revenue at the time of shipment 
at the time of shipment  we book a sales reserve for the entire amount if the customer has the right to return the product 
also  at the time of sale we book a sales reserve for ship from stock and debits ssd s  stock rotations  return material authorizations rma s  authorized price protection programs  and any special programs approved by management 
these sales reserves offset against revenues  which then leads to the net revenue amount we report 
the market price for our products can be significantly different than the book price at which the product was sold to the distributor 
when the market price  as compared with the book price  of a particular sales opportunity from our distributor to their customer would result in low or negative margins to our distributor  a ship from stock and debit is negotiated with the distributor 
ssd history is analyzed and used to develop ssd rates that form the basis of the ssd sales reserve booked each period 
we use historical ssd rates to estimate the ultimate net sales price to the distributor 

table of contents our distribution agreements provide for semi annual stock rotation privileges of typically of net sales for the previous six month period 
the contractual stock rotation applies only to shipments at book price 
asian distributors typically buy our product at less than book price and therefore are not entitled to the stock rotation privilege 
in order to provide for routine inventory refreshing  for our benefit as well as theirs  we typically grant asian distributors stock rotation privileges between and even though we are not contractually obligated to do so 
each month a sales reserve is recorded for the estimated stock rotation privilege earned by our distributors that month 
this reserve is the sum of product of each distributor s net sales for the month and their stock rotation percentage 
from time to time  customers may request to return parts for various reasons including the customers belief that the parts are not performing to specification 
many such return requests are the result of customers incorrectly using the parts  not because the parts are defective 
these requests are reviewed by management and when approved result in a return material authorization rma being established 
we are only obligated to accept returns of defective parts 
for customer convenience  we may approve a particular return request  even though we are not obligated to do so 
each month a sales reserve is recorded for the approved rmas that have not yet been returned 
in the past we have not kept a general warranty reserve because historically valid warranty returns  which are the result of a part not meeting specifications or being non functional  have been immaterial and parts can frequently be re sold to other customers for use in other applications 
we do however monitor and assess rma activity and overall materiality to assess whether a general warranty reserve has become appropriate 
price protection is granted solely at the discretion of pericom management 
the purpose of price protection is to reduce our distributor s cost of inventory as market prices fall thus reducing ssd rates 
price protection proposals for individual products located at individual distributors are prepared by pericom sales management 
pericom general management reviews these proposals and if a particular price protection arrangement is approved  then the dollar impact will be estimated based on the book price reduction per unit for the products approved and the number of units of those products in that distributor s inventory 
a sales reserve is then recorded in that period for the estimated amount in accordance with issue of emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
at the discretion of pericom management  we may offer rebates on specific products sold to specific end customers 
the purpose of the rebates is to allow for pricing adjustments for large programs without affecting the pricing we charge our distributor customers 
the rebate we owe is recorded at the time of shipment 
customers are typically granted payment terms of between and days and they generally pay within those terms 
relatively few customers have been granted terms with cash discounts 
distributors are invoiced for shipments at book price 
when they pay those invoices  they claim debits for ssds  stock rotations  cash discounts  rmas and price protection when appropriate 
once claimed  these debits are then processed against the approvals 
the revenue we record for sales to our distributors is net of estimated provisions for these programs 
when determining this net revenue  we must make significant judgments and estimates 
our estimates are based on historical experience rates  inventory levels in the distribution channel  current trends and other related factors 
however  because of the inherent nature of estimates  there is a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates 
our financial condition and operating results depend on our ability to make reliable estimates and we believe that our estimates are reasonable 
inventories 
inventories are recorded at the lower of standard cost which generally approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market value 
we adjust the carrying value of inventory for excess and obsolete inventory based on inventory age  shipment history and our forecast of demand over a specific future period of time 
the semiconductor markets that we serve are volatile and actual results may vary from our forecast or other assumptions  potentially impacting our assessment of excess and obsolete inventory resulting in material effects on our gross margin 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
as required by sfas statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which the company adopted in fiscal  the company ceased amortizing goodwill with a net carrying value of 
table of contents million that resulted from our investment in pericom technology  inc sfas no 
also requires that goodwill be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the company determined that no impairment of this goodwill existed in fiscal the company also tests other intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
the company determined that no impairment of these other intangible assets existed in fiscal investments 
we have also made other investments including loans  bridge loans convertible to equity or asset purchases as well as direct equity investments 
these loans and investments are made with strategic intentions and have been in privately held technology companies  which by their nature are high risk 
these investments are included in other assets in the balance sheet and are carried at the lower of cost  or market if the investment has experienced an other than temporary decline in value 
we monitor these investments quarterly and make appropriate reductions in carrying value if a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary 
deferred tax assets 
the company s deferred income tax assets represent temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities that will result in deductible amounts in future years  including net operating loss carry forwards 
based on estimates  the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that it is more likely than not that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
if  in the future  the company experience s losses for a sustained period of time  the company may not be able to conclude that it is more likely than not that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets 
if this occurs  the company may be required to increase the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense 
overview pericom semiconductor corporation was incorporated in june we completed our first profitable fiscal year on june  we design  manufacture and market high performance digital  analog and mixed signal integrated circuits and frequency control products used for the transfer  routing  and timing of digital and analog signals within and between computer  networking  data communications and telecommunications systems 
our first volume sales occurred in fiscal and consisted exclusively of volt bit interface logic circuits

in fiscal  the company expanded its bridge product line to include enhanced features  higher performance and to support the pci x bus 
it brought to market low voltage analog switches with r on of ohms 
application specific nd generation gigibit lan switches and usb switches were introduced to the customer base 
supervisory products including watchdog timers and reset circuits premiered from pericom 
during the year  saronix was acquired bringing high performance frequency control products to our comprehensive product portfolio 
in fiscal  we introduced our product solution to support the emerging high performance pci express serial link protocol for computer and communication applications 
our pci express product solutions include pci e signal switches  clock generators  and re driver and re timer products 
we introduced several analog switch and voltage translation products in very small form factor packages to support cell phone and other portable consumer products 
we expanded our high performance video switch solution with the addition of differential video switches operating at greater than ghz to support hdmi dvi signal switching in digital tv and notebook applications 
we also introduced four low voltage  high frequency cmos lvpecl crystal oscillator product families targeting storage and communication applications 
as is typical in the semiconductor industry  we expect selling prices for our products to decline over the life of each product 
our ability to increase net revenues is highly dependent upon our ability to increase unit sales volumes of existing products and to introduce and sell new products in quantities sufficient to compensate for the anticipated declines in selling prices of existing products 
we seek to increase unit sales volume through increased wafer fabrication capacity allocations from our existing foundries  qualification of new foundries  increased number of die per wafer through die size reductions and improved yields of good die through the implementation of advanced process technologies  but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts 
chartered semiconductor manufacturing manufactured approximately   and of the wafers for our semiconductor products in fiscal years  and  respectively 
in addition  magnachip formerly known as hynix manufactured approximately   and of the wafers for our semiconductor products in fiscal years  and declining selling prices will adversely affect gross margins unless we are able to offset such declines with the sale of new higher margin products or achieve commensurate reductions in unit costs 
we seek to 
table of contents improve our overall gross margin through the development and introduction of selected new products that we believe will ultimately achieve higher gross margins 
a higher gross margin for a new product is typically not achieved until some period after the initial introduction of the product after start up expenses for that product have been incurred and once volume production begins 
in general  costs are higher at the introduction of a new product due to the use of a more generalized design schematic  lower economies of scale in the assembly phase and lower die yield 
our ability to reduce unit cost depends on our ability to shrink the die sizes of our products  improve yields  obtain favorable subcontractor pricing  and make in house manufacturing operations more productive and efficient 
there can be no assurance that these efforts  even if successful  will be sufficient to offset declining selling prices 
recent developments on september   the company purchased for approximately million a ownership position in ecera comtek corporation ecera of taiwan 
ecera and its owned subsidiary  azer crystal technology co  ltd 
azer have been a key supplier of quartz crystal blanks and crystal oscillator products 
the company has an option to purchase the remaining of azer within six months of september  results of operations the following table sets forth certain statement of operations data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated

table of contents comparison of fiscal  and net revenues the following table sets forth our revenues and the customer concentrations with respect to such revenues for the periods indicated 
fiscal year ended change fiscal year ended change july  june  june  june  net revenues in thousands percentage of net sales accounted for by top direct customers number of direct customers that each account for more than of net sales percentage of gross sales accounted for by top end customers number of end customers that each account for more than of gross sales direct customers purchase products directly from the company 
these include distributors and contract manufacturers that in turn sell to many end customers as well as oems that also purchase directly from the company 
end customers are oems whose products include the company s products 
end customers may purchase directly from the company or from distributors or contract manufacturers 
we rely on the end customer data provided by our direct distribution and contract manufacturing customers 
on october   the company exercised its option to acquire the assets and related liabilities of saronix  llc of menlo park  california 
beginning with the quarter ended december   the company s revenues included revenues from saronix 
for the year end june   revenues of million were generated from the sales of saronix products 
for the year ended july   revenues of million were generated from sales of saronix products 
the rapid semiconductor industry downturn that began in fiscal caused an over supply of inventories in the global distribution and contract manufacturing channels 
this inventory imbalance pushed order rates down  caused a corresponding drop in backlog  and caused the percentage of net sales represented by orders placed and shipped in the same quarter to grow 
these orders are called turns orders 
during much of fiscal business conditions in the semiconductor industry improved and the percentage of the company s revenue represented by turns orders declined 
in late fiscal order rates again slowed in response to an imbalance of inventory as compared with end demand  and the percentage of turns orders again increased although not to the levels of integrated circuit order rates in fiscal have subsequently improved  but the company remains heavily reliant on turns orders 
this reliance on turns orders  the uncertain strength of our end markets  and the uncertain growth rate of the world economy make it difficult to predict near term demand 
net revenues consist of product sales  which are recognized upon shipment  less an estimate for returns and allowances 
net revenue increased in fiscal versus due to one additional quarter of saronix revenues in fiscal versus fiscal  weeks in fiscal vs 
weeks in fiscal  relative improvement in end market demand  and increased acceptance and shipments of the company s new integrated circuit product offerings  particularly in end markets such as cell phones and digital media 
also  the pricing environment for the company s digital switches and interface logic products improved during fiscal however  the pricing environment could again become more difficult as other companies compete more aggressively for business 
pricing for the company s higher margin analog switch  clock and connect products  many of which are proprietary  is more stable and price declines are generally offset by new product introductions and cost reductions 
for the year ended july   and june   respectively  net revenue included sales reserves for price protection in the amount of  and  
table of contents the net revenue increase in fiscal versus fiscal is due to fiscal net revenues of million versus zero in fiscal resulting from the october acquisition of saronix  a recovery in integrated circuit demand drove a higher volume of unit shipments  the higher demand levels stabilized pricing  inventories in distribution channels had been worked down to a very low level and stabilized so orders through distribution increased and were becoming reflective of end demand  and increased acceptance and shipments of the company s new integrated circuit product offerings 
for the year ended june   and june   respectively net revenue included sales reserves for price protection and rebates totaling  and  the following table sets forth net revenues by country as a percentage of total net revenues for the fiscal years ended july   june   and june  fiscal year ended july  june  june  china including hong kong united states taiwan singapore other less than each total for the fiscal year ended july   as compared with fiscal years and  the percentage of our net revenues derived from sales to the united states decreased principally because of decreased sales to domestic distributors as these distributors adjusted their inventory levels 
in addition  an increasing number of shipments are going to asia where an increasing volume of contract manufacturing work is done 
gross profit fiscal year ended change fiscal year ended change in thousands july  june  june  june  net revenues gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net revenues gross margin the increase in gross profit in fiscal versus fiscal was primarily due to fiscal had a full year of revenues and gross profit for saronix products whereas fiscal only had nine months  unit sales volume of our core integrated circuit products improved as a result of end market demand and customer acceptance of the company s new integrated circuit product offerings  higher gross margin on sales because of a favorable product mix change resulting from a higher percentage of sales of our newer  higher margin integrated circuit products  reduced cost of sales due to reductions in force in november and february  and gross profit in fiscal included saronix acquisition related inventory and reduction in force costs of  whereas there were no comparable costs in fiscal gross profit in fiscal and fiscal benefited from the sale of previously written off inventory of  and  respectively 
the improvement in gross margin percentage was driven by a more favorable mix of the company s higher margin analog switch  clock  and connect products as well as product cost reductions and a more stable pricing environment 
the above improvements were partially offset by an approximately million charge taken in the december quarter to write off inventory obsoleted by a product of end of life program  and the inclusion of saronix product sales for one full year in fiscal versus nine months in fiscal since saronix margins are less than the company s total average margins 

table of contents gross profit in fiscal versus fiscal increased due to the following factors fiscal had nine months of saronix sales totaling million whereas fiscal had none  the industry wide recovery of the integrated circuit business started in fiscal and drove increased unit shipments  and we had higher gross margin on sales because of a favorable product mix change resulting from a higher percentage of sales of our newer  higher margin integrated circuit products 
partially offsetting this is the inclusion of saronix revenues for nine months in fiscal versus no saronix revenues in fiscal since saronix margins are less than the company s total average margins 
future gross profit and gross margin are highly dependent on the level and product mix of net revenues 
this includes the mix of sales between lower margin saronix products and our higher margin integrated circuit products 
although we have been successful at favorably improving our integrated circuit product mix and penetrating new end markets  there can be no assurance that this will continue 
accordingly  we are not able to predict future gross profit levels or gross margins with certainty 
research and development fiscal year ended change fiscal year ended change in thousands july  june  june  june  net revenues research and development r d as a percentage of net revenues research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to personnel and overhead  non recurring engineering charges  and other costs associated with the design  prototyping  testing  manufacturing process support and customer applications support of our products 
the expense increase in fiscal versus was primarily due to increased r d wafer fabrication and assembly charges due to a significant number of our products being re designed and re qualified as a result of chartered semiconductor s closure of one of its fabrication facilities and the required migration of the company s products to another of its fabrication facilities  increased mask costs from research and development projects  continuing ramp up of engineering costs in our pericom taiwan ltd subsidiary  and the inclusion of months of saronix engineering expense in fiscal versus nine months in fiscal there was also weeks of expense in fiscal versus weeks in fiscal the expense increase for fiscal as compared to fiscal was also due to increased mask costs  the inclusion of nine months of saronix engineering expenses in fiscal versus zero in fiscal  the ramp up of pericom taiwan ltd in fiscal lower expense in was partially offset by a write off of  of in process research and development that had been acquired from saronix 
no such write off occurred in fiscal the company believes that continued spending on research and development to develop new products and improve manufacturing processes is critical to the company s success and  consequently  expects to increase research and development expenses in future periods over the long term 
in the short term  the company intends to continue to focus on cost control until business conditions improve 
if business conditions deteriorate or the rate of improvement does not meet our expectations  the company may implement further cost cutting actions 
selling  general and administrative fiscal year ended change fiscal year ended change in thousands july  june  june  june  net revenues selling  general and administrative s  g a percentage of net revenues 
table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for sales  marketing  finance  administration  human resources and general management 
the expense increase in fiscal versus fiscal is due to higher sales commission expense due to increased revenues  increased costs associated with sarbanes oxley section compliance  inclusion of months of saronix sg a expense in fiscal versus nine months in fiscal  and fiscal had weeks of expense versus weeks in fiscal the above increases were partially offset by a  gain from the sale of a building in ireland in fiscal and the impact of the reductions in force in november and february the expense increase in fiscal versus is due to the inclusion of nine months of saronix sg a expense in fiscal versus zero in fiscal  higher sales commission expense due to increased revenues from the saronix acquisition  and the fiscal write off of  saronix customer backlog valuation 
these increases were partially offset by the impact of the reductions in force in november the company anticipates that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods over the long term due to increased staffing levels  particularly in sales and marketing  as well as increased commission expense to the extent the company achieves higher sales levels 
in the short term  costs associated with sarbanes oxley section compliance will increase selling  general and administrative expenses 
the company intends to continue to focus on controlling costs until business conditions improve 
if business conditions deteriorate or the rate of improvement does not meet our expectations  the company may implement further cost cutting actions 
restructuring charge in the year ended july  restructuring charges of  were recorded in connection with a reduction of employee positions 
the eliminated positions were mostly production related  but sales and administrative positions were impacted as well 
the intended effect of this restructuring is to continue the company s outsourcing program  realign the company s sales force to reflect geographic sales changes and revised selling strategy  and to reduce costs 
in the year ended june  there was a restructuring charge of  related to an unused leased facility resulting from our move to our new corporate headquarters 
this restructuring accrual became fully depleted in the first quarter of fiscal  when the lease terminated 
in the year ended june  there was a restructuring charge of million related to another unused leased facility 
this facility had originally been leased to accommodate future expansion 
as a result of the semiconductor industry downturn then underway  the company revised its expansion plans and this facility was subleased 
at the time of the sublease  a  restructuring charge was recorded that represented the difference between the sublease rate and the rate the company was paying 
the million restructuring charge was recorded when the company received notice that the tenant would move from this facility and the company estimated that it would not be able to sublease the facility due to the excess available real estate in san jose  california 
due to the continued downturn in the company s business  the company determined that this portion of the facility would not be utilized over the remaining lease term 
the restructuring charge represented the future lease payments and estimated utility and maintenance costs for the remainder of the lease 
the restructuring accrual was fully depleted in the fourth quarter of fiscal  when the lease terminated 
minority interest for the year ended july   minority interest in the losses of our consolidated subsidiary pericom taiwan ltd 
was  there were no minority interest in the years ended june  or june  
table of contents interest income fiscal year ended change fiscal year ended change in thousands july  june  june  june  interest income interest income was relatively unchanged between fiscal and fiscal with somewhat increased interest rates being offset by planned capital losses as the portfolio was restructured to achieve better future returns 
the decrease in interest income in fiscal versus fiscal is due to a  reduction in capital gains coupled with many higher yielding investments maturing and being reinvested at lower interest rates 
provision for income taxes fiscal year ended fiscal year ended in thousands july  june  june  june  pre tax income loss income tax provision benefit effective tax rate our effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes  the effect of foreign income tax and foreign loss  the utilization of research and development tax credits and changes in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
for fiscal the rate was very low compared to statutory rates and prior year because relatively small pre tax income of  was almost completely offset by various tax credits 
a reconciliation of our tax rates for fiscal years  and is detailed in note to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this report on form k 
the income tax benefit in fiscal was million as compared with a benefit of million in fiscal the decrease was due to lower net operating losses in fiscal partially offset by an increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in fiscal the provision for income taxes differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes  the utilization of research and development tax credits and a change in the deferred asset valuation allowance 
equity in net income loss of pericom technology  inc 
fiscal year ended change fiscal year ended change in thousands july  june  june  june  equity in net income loss of investee equity in net income loss of investee is the company s allocated portion of the net income or losses of pericom technology  inc pti  a british virgin islands corporation based in shanghai  people s republic of china 
pericom and certain pericom shareholders formed pti in to develop and market semiconductors in china and certain other asian countries 
the company adopted eitf in the quarter ended december  this adoption did not cause the company to cease recognizing its allocated portion of the net income or losses of pericom technology  inc the company s allocated portion of pti s results declined to a profit of  for fiscal from a profit of  for fiscal due to telecommunications revenue declines as a result of the slowdown in china telecommunications markets that pti serves 

table of contents the company s allocated portion of pti s results in fiscal which was a profit of  improved from a loss of  in fiscal due to strength in the china telecommunications market and success with certain new consumer products both of which drove improvements in gross margin and profitability 
liquidity and capital resources as of july   the company s principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million as compared with million as of june  and million as of june  on september   the company purchased for approximately million a ownership position in ecera comtek corporation ecera of taiwan 
ecera and its owned subsidiary  azer crystal technology co  ltd 
axer have been a key supplier of quartz crystal blanks and crystal oscillator products 
the company has an option to purchase for approximately million the remaining of azer within six months of september  consequently  up to approximately million of the company s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments may be used to complete these investments 
as of july  million is liquid and classified as cash and equivalents compared with million as of june  and million as of june  the maturities of the company s short term investments are staggered throughout the year so that cash requirements are met 
since the company is a fabless semiconductor manufacturer  it has lower capital equipment requirements than other semiconductor manufacturers that own fabs 
for fiscal year  the company spent million on property and equipment compared to million and million as of june  and respectively 
interest rates are at a historically low level although they have been trending upwards as a result of actions taken by the federal reserve board 
the company generated million of interest income for the fiscal year ended july  compared to million and million in fiscal year ended june  and june  respectively 
in the longer term the company may generate less interest income if its total invested balance decreases and these decreases are not offset by rising interest rates or increased cash generated from operations or other sources 
the company s net cash provided in operating activities of million in fiscal was primarily a result of net income of  a million decrease in inventories  including depreciation and amortization of million  partially off set by a decrease to accounts payable of million  and an increase in accounts receivable of million 
the decrease in accounts receivable is the result of a decrease in the accounts receivable allowance of approximately million 
this decrease is primarily due to a reduction in the reserves for returned product at july  as compared with june  at june  the accounts receivable allowance included reserves for the return of product from terminated distributors as well as for the return of product associated with the product end of life program then underway 
on july  there were no terminated distributors in the process of returning product and there was no product end of life program underway 
a  reduction in accrued liabilities  and a  gain on sale or disposal of assets 
the reduction in net inventories during fiscal year ended july  was largely due to inventory written off as well as a result of a concerted effort to reduce inventory levels to a lower level in fiscal year the decrease in accounts payable during this period was the result of routine period to period fluctuations 
the increase in accounts receivable is primarily a result of a decrease in the accounts receivable allowance of approximately million as a result of decreased rma s stock rotation  ship from stock debit  and price protection 
in fiscal year  the company s net cash used in operating activities of  was primarily due to net losses of million  a million increase in deferred income taxes and a million increase in inventories partially offset by depreciation and amortization of million and an increase to accounts payable of million 
these are net of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of saronix llc 
the increase in inventories and accounts payable are primarily due to the growth in our operation 
the company s cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal was primarily due to net losses of million offset by depreciation and amortization of million  and other than temporary decline in the value of investments of million and a million decrease in accounts receivable 
generally  as sales levels rise  the company expects inventories  accounts receivable and accounts payable to increase 
however  there will be routine fluctuations in these accounts from period to period that may be significant in amount 

table of contents the company s net cash provided by investing activities of million in fiscal was primarily due to maturities of short term investments exceeding purchases by million  proceeds from the sale of a building held for sale a building in ireland from the saronix acquisition of million and the sale of a minority interest in a subsidiary of  which were partially offset  and in part  by purchases of property and equipment of million 
the company s cash provided by investing activities of million in fiscal was primarily due to maturities of short term investments exceeding purchases by million partially offset by loans to saronix of million and purchases of property and equipment of million 
the company s cash used in investing activities of million for fiscal was primarily due to million of purchases of property and equipment  loans provided to saronix of million and an investment of approximately million increase in other assets primarily from an investment in gct semiconductor which was partially offset by maturities of short term investments exceeding purchases by million 
the company s cash used in financing activities in fiscal of million was primarily due to the repurchase of million in common stock and payment of a bank loan of million  partially offset by the sale of common stock from the company s employee stock plans of million 
the company s cash provided by financing activities in fiscal of million was primarily due to the sale of common stock from the company s employee stock plans 
the company s cash used in financing activities in fiscal of  was due to the repurchase of common stock by the company of million  which was offset by proceeds received from the sale of common stock from the company s employee stock plans of million 
the company s board of directors has approved the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock 
as of july   the company has repurchased  shares at a cost of approximately million 
in fiscal year  there were  shares repurchased at an approximate cost of approximately million 
no shares were repurchased during fiscal year as of september  there were  shares repurchased at an approximate cost of million

fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosure at july   our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed income securities  excluding those classified as cash equivalents  of million see note of notes to financial statements 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
for example  if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of july   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not have a material effect on our results of operations over the next fiscal year
