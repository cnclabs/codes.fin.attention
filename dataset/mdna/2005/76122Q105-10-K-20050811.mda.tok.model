during fiscal  we also opened practices in paris  france  birmingham  alabama and south florida 
subsequent to year end  we have opened an office in copenhagen  denmark 
at may   we served our clients through offices in the united states and offices abroad 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we completed three transactions the acquisitions to enhance our international presence as well as our ability to assist clients with compliance efforts under sarbanes 
the largest of the three was the all cash acquisition for million of the outstanding capital shares of ernst young s subsidiary  executive temporary management bv etm in the netherlands on july  etm  renamed resources global professionals europe bv rgpe  is considered a market leader in the interim management industry in the netherlands 
we believe this acquisition provides a foundation in continental europe and will allow us to market to our current and prospective multinational clients seeking an alternative to big four firms  particularly in light of concerns about auditor independence 
rgpe  which had seven offices at the date of acquisition  has consolidated two of the offices  in an effort to streamline operations and reduce costs during the european economic slowdown 
rgpe contracted with  or employed  professional service associates on assignment as of may  in addition to the european expansion driven by the acquisition of rgpe  we also acquired the operations of deloitte re sources pty ltd 
from deloitte touche tohmatsu australia in an all cash deal for million on june  we originally launched the subsidiary  renamed resources connection australia pty ltd 
doing business as resources global professionals australia  in on behalf of the deloitte touche tohmatsu australia firm 
the acquisition presented the opportunity to expand our asia pacific presence 
in july  we acquired the company that developed policyiq  a web based solution for internal controls and policy management documentation and content management 
the purchase included upfront cash and provision for contingent payments based on sales volume 
policyiq is a tool that our clients use to assist in complying with sarbanes  among other content management initiatives 
we primarily charge our clients on an hourly basis for the professional services of our associates 
we recognize revenue once services have been rendered and invoice the majority of our clients in the united states on a weekly basis 
our clients are contractually obligated to pay us for all hours billed 
to a much lesser extent  we also earn revenue if a client hires one of our associates 
this type of contractually non refundable revenue is recognized at the time our client completes the hiring process and represented  and of our revenue for the years ended may   and  respectively 
we periodically review our outstanding accounts receivable balance and determine an estimate of the amount of those receivables we believe may prove uncollectible 
our provision for bad debts is included in our selling  general and administrative expenses 
the costs to pay our professional associates and all related benefit and incentive costs  including provisions for paid time off and other employee benefits  are included in direct cost of services 
we pay most of our associates on an hourly basis for all hours worked on client engagements and  therefore  direct cost of services tends to vary directly with the volume of revenue we earn 
we expense the benefits we pay to our associates as they are earned 
these benefits include paid time off and holidays  a bonus incentive plan  referral bonus programs  subsidized group health  dental and life insurance programs  a matching k retirement plan  the ability to participate in the company s employee stock purchase plan  and professional development and career

the actual quarter end dates for fiscal and were as follows for fiscal  august  first quarter  november  second quarter  february  third quarter  and may  fourth quarter  and for fiscal  august  first quarter  november  second quarter  february  third quarter  and may  fourth quarter 
for convenience  all references herein to years or annual periods of one or more years are to years or annual periods ended may critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe a are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and b involve inherently uncertain issues that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
valuation of long lived assets we assess the potential impairment of long lived tangible and intangible assets periodically or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
under the current accounting standard  our goodwill and certain other intangible assets are no longer subject to periodic amortization over their estimated useful lives 
these assets are now considered to have an indefinite life and their carrying values are required to be assessed by us for impairment at least annually 
depending on future market values of our stock  our operating performance and other factors  these assessments could potentially result in impairment reductions of these intangible assets in the future and this adjustment may materially affect the company s future financial results 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our clients failing to make required payments for services rendered 
we estimate this allowance based upon our knowledge of the financial condition of our clients  review of historical receivable and reserve trends and other pertinent information 
if the financial condition of our clients deteriorates or we note an unfavorable trend in aggregate receivable collections  additional allowances may be required and these additional allowances may materially affect the company s future financial results 
income taxes in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates of income taxes  if applicable  in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
the process incorporates an assessment of any current tax exposure together with temporary differences resulting from different treatment of transactions for tax and financial statement purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
the recovery of deferred tax assets from future taxable income must be assessed and  to the extent recovery is not likely  we will establish a valuation allowance 
an increase in the valuation allowance results in recording 
table of contents additional tax expense 
if the ultimate tax liability differs from the amount of tax expense we have reflected in the consolidated statements of income  an adjustment of tax expense may need to be recorded and this adjustment may materially affect the company s future financial results 
revenue recognition we primarily charge our clients on an hourly basis for the professional services of our associates 
we recognize revenue once services have been rendered and invoice the majority of our clients in the united states on a weekly basis 
some of our clients served by our international operations are billed on a monthly basis 
our clients are contractually obligated to pay us for all hours billed 
to a much lesser extent  we also earn revenue if a client hires one of our associates 
this type of contractually non refundable revenue is recognized at the time our client completes the hiring process 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
results of operations the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  our consolidated statements of income data 
these historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results

table of contents year ended may  compared to year ended may  the comments for the year ended may  below include the results of operations for nordic spring from august  through may  the results of operations for the year ended may  include the results of operations of the following acquisitions for the following periods for resources global professionals australia  a full year of results of operations  for rgpe  results of operations from july  through may   and for policyiq  results of operations from july  through may  computations of percentage change period over period are based upon the truncated numbers presented herein 
revenue 
revenue increased million or to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  the continued expansion of our scope of services and improved overall demand for our services triggered the increase in revenue  resulting in more billable hours for our associates and an improvement in rate per hour 
we believe our business expanded due in part to increasing market awareness of our ability to provide services 
in particular  ras engagements increased significantly in fiscal we believe one of the reasons for the increase in ras engagements was the need generated by companies with calendar year end deadlines for initial compliance with the requirements of section of sarbanes 
our provision of services in fiscal to new clients in year one of compliance with section of sarbanes may provide the opportunity for follow on year two services or other types of services in subsequent fiscal years  however  there can be no assurance that there will be continuing demand for sarbanes or related internal accounting control services 
average bill rates improved by compared to the prior year average bill rate 
the increase in revenue for the year is also due to the increase in the number of associates on assignment from  at the end of fiscal to  at the end of fiscal we operated offices  including international offices  during the final quarter of fiscal  compared to offices  including international offices  in the last quarter of fiscal our clients do not sign long term contracts with us 
therefore  our future revenue or operating results cannot be reliably predicted from previous quarters or from extrapolation of past results 
revenue for united states offices improved or million from million for the fiscal year ended may  to million for the fiscal year ended may  revenue for the dutch practice improved or million  from million for the fiscal year ended may  to million for the fiscal year ended may   however  the may  results include amounts only from july  date of acquisition 
approximately million of the increase in dutch revenues was from the impact of foreign currency translation due to the weaker us dollar during fiscal compared to fiscal the other international offices revenue grew or million  from million for the fiscal year ended may  to million for the fiscal year ended may  approximately million of the increase in the other international revenues was from the impact of foreign currency translation due to the weaker us dollar during fiscal compared to fiscal nevertheless  all international practices enjoyed growth  particularly in the united kingdom  canada and japan 
the fiscal results include three quarters of operations for the nordic spring practice acquired in sweden in august direct cost of services 
direct cost of services increased or million to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  the increase in direct cost of services was attributable to the previously described expansion of the scope of services resulting in more chargeable hours for our associates at higher average pay rates 
overall  the average pay rate per hour increased year over year 
the direct cost of services decreased as a percentage of revenue from for fiscal year to for fiscal year the favorable change in the direct cost of services percentage was the result of improvement in the ratio of direct associate salary expense compared to hourly revenue generated  as reflected by the improved average bill rate per hour over average pay rate per hour 
offsetting this improvement was the greater impact of the company s international operations which have a higher direct cost of services percentage higher than the company s targeted and the increase in volume of zero margin client expense reimbursements as the company s projects requiring associate travel increased significantly 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue from for the year ended may  to for the year ended may  as a result of improved leverage on fixed operating costs  the increase in revenue for fiscal also outpaced the company s internal hiring 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  in particular  compensation and related benefit expenses increased as management and administrative headcount grew from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal the increase in dollars spent was attributable to the increase in salaries and benefit costs driven by the larger headcount and occupancy and related costs from relocated or expanded offices 
other increases in spending in fiscal were bonus expense as a result of the company s improved revenue results  costs related to the company s compliance with the requirements of sarbanes  recruiting expense to support the need for an increased number of associates  and bad debt expense in line with the company s receivables growth 
amortization and depreciation expenses 
amortization of intangible assets remained steady at approximately million in both fiscal and the initial amortization of the intangible assets identified in the purchase price allocation of nordic spring in fiscal offset the completion of amortization of certain of the intangibles associated with prior year acquisitions 
depreciation expense increased from million for the year ended may  to million for the year ended may  this increase reflects a full year of depreciation on assets acquired during fiscal  additional depreciation resulting from offices relocated or expanded since may  and investments in information technology 
interest income 
during fiscal  the company generated interest income of million compared to interest income of approximately  in the year ended may  the increase in interest income is a combination of a higher average cash balance available for investment in fiscal and improved interest rates available year over year 
the company has invested available cash in money market and commercial paper investments that have been classified as cash equivalents due to the short maturities of these investments 
as of may   the company has million of investments in government agency bonds with remaining maturity dates between three months and one year from the balance sheet date and million of government agency bonds with remaining maturity dates in excess of one year from the balance sheet date 
the bonds mature through may and have coupon rates ranging from to 
these investments have been classified in the may  consolidated balance sheet as held to maturity securities 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased from million for the year ended may  to million for the year ended may  as a result of the increase in the company s pre tax income 
the effective tax rate in fiscal was compared with in fiscal  which differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state taxes  net of federal benefit 
periodically  the company reviews the components of both book and taxable income to analyze the adequacy of the provision 
there can be no assurance that the company s effective tax rate will not increase in the future 
year ended may  compared to year ended may  the comments following for the year ended may  include the results of operations for the full year for resources global professionals australia  from july  for rgpe  and from july  for policyiq 
the acquisitions  completed in the first quarter of fiscal  are referred to in the comments below as the acquisitions 
the results of operations of the supply chain management scm practice acquired in october are included from october  in the fiscal results 
finally  the results of operations for the fiscal year ended may  consist of weeks  while the results of operations for the fiscal year ended may  consist of weeks 

table of contents revenue 
revenue increased million or to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  the acquisitions contributed million to the growth in revenues compared to the prior year 
without the additional revenue from the acquisitions  revenues increased 
this increase was triggered by the continued expansion of our scope of services and improved overall demand for our services  resulting in more billable hours for our associates and an improvement in rate per hour 
we believe our services expanded in finance and accounting  information technology and sarbanes related engagements due in part to increasing market awareness of our ability to provide those types of services 
average bill rates improved by compared to the prior year average bill rate 
the increase in revenue for the year is also reflected by the increase in the number of associates on assignment from  at the end of fiscal to  at the end of fiscal including associates working for the australian and netherlands practices as of may  
we operated offices during the final quarter of fiscal  compared to offices in the last quarter of fiscal direct cost of services 
direct cost of services increased million or to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  the increase in direct cost of services was attributable to the previously described expansion of the scope of services resulting in more chargeable hours for our associates at higher average pay rates as well as the impact of the services provided by associates employed by the acquisitions 
overall  the average pay rate per hour increased year over year 
the direct cost of services increased as a percentage of revenue from for fiscal year to for fiscal year among the factors contributing to this increase were the incremental increase in pay rate per hour compared to bill rate per hour  the greater impact of international operations which use a higher percentage of independent contractors  the increase in dollar volume of zero margin client expense reimbursements  as the company s projects in fiscal requiring associate travel increased significantly  and the decrease in conversion fees as a percentage of revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal conversion fees are non refundable fees recognized when a client hires one of our associates 
the cost of compensation and related benefits offered to the associates of our international offices is greater as a percentage of revenue than our domestic operations 
thus  the direct cost of services percentage of our international offices has usually exceeded our domestic operations targeted direct cost of services percentage of 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue from for the year ended may  to for the year ended may  as a result of improved leverage 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  this increase was primarily attributable to the acquisitions 
in particular  compensation and related benefit expenses increased because management and administrative headcount grew from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal excluding the acquisitions  management and administrative headcount was at the end of fiscal the increase in dollars spent apart from the acquisitions was attributable to the increase in salaries and benefit costs driven by the larger headcount and occupancy and related costs from new offices opened 
in addition  marketing and advertising expenses increased in the current fiscal year  primarily related to the netherlands practice  bonus expense increased as a result of the company s improved revenue results  and the company increased its provision for bad debts in fiscal as compared to fiscal with the increase in revenues during the year 
amortization and depreciation expenses 
amortization of intangible assets increased to million for fiscal compared to  in fiscal the increase is related intangible assets acquired in the acquisitions 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company completed its allocation of the purchase price of the acquisitions  and considered a number of factors in performing this valuation  including a valuation of identifiable intangible assets 
as a result  approximately million of the purchase price was assigned to amortizable intangible assets related to contractually based customer relationships  acquired databases of potential associates and technology related to the policyiq software 
these intangibles will be amortized over one to five years 
the company is also amortizing intangible assets related to the scm acquisition through fiscal in the prior year  amortization expense related primarily to the amortization of the scm intangible assets 

table of contents depreciation expense increased from million for the year ended may  to million for the year ended may  this increase reflects the impact of depreciation related to the acquisitions  the other offices opened since the beginning of fiscal  a full year of depreciation of assets acquired during fiscal and our incremental investment in information technology 
interest income 
during fiscal  the company generated interest income of  compared to interest income of million in the year ended may  the decrease in interest income is a combination of a lower average cash balance available for investment in fiscal as a result of the use of approximately million for the acquisitions in the first quarter of fiscal and the lower interest rates available year over year 
the company has invested available cash in money market and commercial paper investments that have been classified as cash equivalents due to the short maturities of these investments 
as of may   the company has million of government agency bonds with remaining maturity dates in excess of one year from the balance sheet date 
the bonds mature through and have coupon rates ranging from to 
these investments have been classified in the may  consolidated balance sheet as held to maturity securities 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased from million for the year ended may  to million for the year ended may  as a result of the increase in the company s pre tax income 
the effective tax rate in fiscal was compared with in fiscal quarterly results the following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of income data for each of the eight quarters in the two year period ended may  in the opinion of management  this data has been prepared on a basis substantially consistent with our audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this document  and includes all adjustments  consisting of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of the data

table of contents our quarterly results have fluctuated in the past and we believe they will continue to do so in the future 
certain factors that could affect our quarterly operating results are described below in the section of this report entitled risks related to our business 
due to these and other factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful indicators of future performance 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by our operations and  to the extent necessary  available commitments under our revolving line of credit 
we have generated positive cash flows from operations since inception  and we continued to do so during the year ended may  at may   the company had operating leases  primarily for office premises  expiring at various dates 
at may   the company had no significant capital leases 
future minimum rental commitments under operating leases are as follows payments due by period amounts in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations the company s entered into a million unsecured revolving credit facility with bank of america effective march  the credit agreement 
the credit agreement allows the company to choose the interest rate applicable to advances 
the interest rate options are bank of america s prime rate  a london inter bank offered libor rate plus or bank of america s grand cayman banking center ibor rate plus 
interest  if any  is payable monthly 
there is an annual facility fee of payable on the unutilized portion of the credit agreement 
the credit agreement expires december  as of may  and  the company had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and is in compliance with all covenants included in the credit agreement 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal cash provided by operations in fiscal resulted primarily from the net income of the company of million 
other components of the net increase in cash provided by operations were the increase in the accrual for management incentive bonus as well as the profit sharing plan for associates as of may  compared to may   reflecting the company s revenue increase 
the increase in the number of associates on assignment at the end of fiscal as compared to fiscal also caused the company s accrued salary obligation to increase 
these favorable operating cash flow activities were offset by the increase in the company s accounts receivable balance in fiscal of million  triggered primarily by the company s higher revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal the company had million in cash and cash equivalents  million in short term investments and million of long term marketable securities at may  net cash used in investing activities totaled million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the company used cash to invest in short term and long term marketable securities commercial paper and government agency bonds for a net amount of million and spent approximately million  primarily on technology upgrades to its operating systems as well as on leasehold improvements and office equipment during fiscal in fiscal  the company spent approximately million to acquire nordic spring as compared to approximately million in the prior year to the complete the acquisitions described above 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million for the year ended may   compared to million for the year ended may  the decreased volume of stock option exercises in fiscal caused this change in addition to the company s repurchase of  shares of its common stock for approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 
table of contents our ongoing operations and anticipated growth in the geographic markets we currently serve will require us to continue to make investments in capital equipment  primarily technology hardware and software 
in addition  we may consider making additional strategic acquisitions 
we anticipate that our current cash  existing availability under our revolving line of credit and the ongoing cash flows from our operations will be adequate to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
if we require additional capital resources to grow our business  either internally or through acquisition  we may seek to sell additional equity securities or to secure additional debt financing 
the sale of additional equity securities or the addition of new debt financing could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we may not be able to obtain financing arrangements in amounts or on terms acceptable to us in the future 
in the event we are unable to obtain additional financing when needed  we may be compelled to delay or curtail our plans to develop our business  which could have a material adverse affect on our operations  market position and competitiveness

revised  share based payment sfas r 
this standard requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be expensed in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim period after june  the pro forma disclosures permitted under sfas will no longer be allowed as an alternative presentation to recognition in the financial statements 
under sfas r  the company must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive option  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the retroactive method records compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated

the company does not expect to apply this provision based upon its preliminary evaluation 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab which expresses the views of the sec regarding the interaction between sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides the sec s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
in particular sab provides guidance related to share based payment transaction with nonemployees  the transition from nonpublic to public entity status  valuation methods including assumptions such as expected volatility and expected term  the accounting for certain redeemable financial instrument issues under share based payment arrangements  the classification of compensation expense  non gaap financial measures  first time adoption of sfas r in an interim period  capitalization of compensation costs related to share based payment arrangements  the accounting for income tax effects of share based payment arrangements under adoption of sfas r  the modification of employee share options prior to adoption of sfas r  and disclosures in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations subsequent to adoption of sfas r

and fas no 
sfas 
sfas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes  unless impracticable  retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle 
sfas also provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is impracticable and for reporting a change when retrospective application is impracticable 
the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements is not an accounting change

our ability to attract and retain associates with the requisite experience and skills depends on several factors including  but not limited to  our ability to provide our associates with full time employment  obtain the type of challenging and high quality projects that our associates seek  pay competitive compensation and provide competitive benefits  and provide our associates with flexibility as to hours worked and assignment of client engagements 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in accomplishing any of these factors and  even if we are  that we will be successful in attracting and retaining the number of highly qualified and experienced associates necessary to maintain and grow our business 
the market for professional services is highly competitive  and if we are unable to compete effectively against our competitors  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
we operate in a competitive  fragmented market  and we compete for clients and associates with a variety of organizations that offer similar services 
the competition is likely to increase in the future due to the expected growth of the market and the relatively few barriers to entry 
our principal competitors include consulting firms  independent contractors  employees loaned by the big four accounting firms  traditional and internet based staffing firms  and the in house resources of our clients 

table of contents we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively against existing or future competitors 
many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources  greater revenues and greater name recognition  which may afford them an advantage in attracting and retaining clients and associates 
in addition  our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to changes in companies needs and developments in the professional services industry 
an economic downturn or change in the use of outsourced professional services associates may adversely affect our business 
during the downturn in the us economy during fiscal and  our business was adversely affected 
as the general level of economic activity slowed  our clients delayed or cancelled plans that involved professional services  particularly outsourced professional services 
consequently  we experienced fluctuations in the demand for our services 
in addition  the use of professional services associates on a project by project basis could decline for non economic reasons 
in the event of a non economic reduction in the demand for our associates  our financial results could suffer 
our business depends upon our ability to secure new projects from clients and  therefore  we could be adversely affected if we fail to do so 
we do not have long term agreements with our clients for the provision of services 
the success of our business is dependent on our ability to secure new projects from clients 
for example  if we are unable to secure new client projects because of improvements in our competitors service offerings or because of an economic downturn decreasing the demand for outsourced professional services  our business is likely to be materially adversely affected 
new impediments to our ability to secure projects from clients may develop over time  such as the increasing use by large clients of companies that manage their relationship with service providers 
we may be legally liable for damages resulting from the performance of projects by our associates or for our clients mistreatment of our associates 
many of our engagements with our clients involve projects that are critical to our clients businesses 
if we fail to meet our contractual obligations  we could be subject to legal liability or damage to our reputation  which could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
it is likely  because of the nature of our business  that we will be sued in the future 
claims brought against us could have a serious negative effect on our reputation and on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
because we are in the business of placing our associates in the workplaces of other companies  we are subject to possible claims by our associates alleging discrimination  sexual harassment  negligence and other similar activities by our clients 
we may also be subject to similar claims from our clients based on activities by our associates 
the cost of defending such claims  even if groundless  could be substantial and the associated negative publicity could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain associates and clients 
we may not be able to grow our business  manage our growth or sustain our current business 
we grew rapidly from our inception in until by opening new offices and by increasing the volume of services we provide through existing offices 
we experienced a decline in revenue in fiscal to million from million in fiscal  but revenue has increased in each subsequent fiscal year 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or expand our market presence in our current locations or to successfully enter other markets or locations 
a significant portion of recent growth emanates from clients demands related to compliance with certain sections of sarbanes 
for large companies with calendar year ends  initial compliance was required by march our ability to successfully grow our business will depend upon a number of factors  including our ability to grow our client base  expand profitably into new cities  
table of contents provide additional professional services lines  hire associates  maintain margins in the face of pricing pressures  manage costs  and maintain or grow revenues from clients who have engaged us for sarbanes compliance 
even if we are able to continue our growth  the growth will result in new and increased responsibilities for our management as well as increased demands on our internal systems  procedures and controls  and our administrative  financial  marketing and other resources 
failure to adequately respond to these new responsibilities and demands may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operation 
the increase in our international activities will expose us to additional operational challenges that we might not otherwise face 
as we increase our international activities  we will have to confront and manage a number of risks and expenses that we would not otherwise face if we conducted our operations solely in the united states 
if any of these risks or expenses occur  there could be a material negative effect on our operating results 
these risks and expenses include difficulties in staffing and managing foreign offices as a result of  among other things  distance  language and cultural differences  less flexible labor laws and regulations  expenses associated with customizing our professional services for clients in foreign countries  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  when we sell our professional services in denominations other than us dollars  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local companies  political and economic instability in some international markets  multiple  conflicting and changing government laws and regulations  trade barriers  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
we have acquired  and may continue to acquire  companies  and these acquisitions could disrupt our business 
we have acquired several companies and may continue to acquire companies in the future 
entering into an acquisition entails many risks  any of which could harm our business  including diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  failure to integrate the acquired company with our existing business  failure to motivate  or loss of  key employees from either our existing business or the acquired business  potential impairment of relationships with our employees and clients  additional operating expenses not offset by additional revenue  incurrence of significant non recurring charges  incurrence of additional debt with restrictive covenants or other limitations  
table of contents dilution of our stock as a result of issuing equity securities  and assumption of liabilities of the acquired company 
our business could suffer if we lose the services of one or more key members of our management 
our future success depends upon the continued employment of certain key members of management  including donald b 
murray  our chief executive officer  and stephen j 
giusto  our chief financial officer 
the departure of mr 
murray  mr 
giusto or other members of our management team could significantly disrupt our operations 
key members of our senior management team also include karen m 
ferguson  an executive vice president  john d 
bower  our senior vice president  finance  and kate w 
duchene  our chief legal officer and executive vice president of human relations 
we do not have employment agreements with mr 
bower or ms 
duchene 
our quarterly financial results may be subject to significant fluctuations that may increase the volatility of our stock price 
our results of operations could vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include our ability to attract new clients and retain current clients  the mix of client projects  the announcement or introduction of new services by us or any of our competitors  the expansion of the professional services offered by us or any of our competitors into new locations both nationally and internationally  changes in the demand for our services by our clients  the entry of new competitors into any of our markets  the number of associates eligible for our offered benefits as the average length of employment with the company increases  the number of holidays in a quarter  particularly the day of the week on which they occur  changes in the pricing of our professional services or those of our competitors  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to management and expansion of our business  the timing of acquisitions and related costs  such as compensation charges that fluctuate based on the market price of our common stock  and the periodic fourth quarter consisting of weeks 
due to these factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful indicators of future performance 
it is possible that in some future periods  our results of operations may be below the expectations of investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock could decline 
if our internal controls over financial reporting do not comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act  our business and stock price could be adversely affected 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to evaluate periodically the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal controls as of the end of each fiscal year 
the first management report on internal controls is contained in this report 
section also requires our independent registered public accountant to attest to  and report on  management s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting 

table of contents our management does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors or frauds 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the control system s objectives will be met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  involving us have been  or will be  detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes 
controls can also be circumvented by individual acts of a person  or by collusion among two or more people  or by management override of controls 
the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and we cannot assure you that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
over time  controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies and procedures 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to errors or frauds may occur and not be detected 
although our management has determined  and our independent registered public accountant has attested  that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of may   we cannot assure you that we or our independent registered public accountant will not identify a material weakness in our internal controls in the future 
a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting would require management and our independent registered public accountant to evaluate our internal controls as ineffective 
if our internal control over financial reporting is not considered adequate  we may experience a loss of public confidence  which could have an adverse effect on our business and our stock price 
we may be subject to laws and regulations that impose difficult and costly compliance requirements and subject us to potential liability and the loss of clients 
in connection with providing services to clients in certain regulated industries  such as the gaming and energy industries  we are subject to industry specific regulations  including licensing and reporting requirements 
complying with these requirements is costly and  if we fail to comply  we could be prevented from rendering services to clients in those industries in the future 
additionally  changes in these requirements  or in other laws applicable to us  in the future could increase our costs of compliance 
it may be difficult for a third party to acquire our company  and this could depress our stock price 
delaware corporate law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay  defer or prevent a change of control of our company or our management 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
as a result  these provisions could limit the price that future investors are willing to pay for your shares 
these provisions authorize our board of directors to establish one or more series of undesignated preferred stock  the terms of which can be determined by the board of directors at the time of issuance  divide our board of directors into three classes of directors  with each class serving a staggered three year term 
because the classification of the board of directors generally increases the difficulty of replacing a majority of the directors  it may tend to discourage a third party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us and may make it difficult to change the composition of the board of directors  prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors which  if not prohibited  could allow a minority stockholder holding a sufficient percentage of a class of shares to ensure the election of one or more directors  require that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be effected by any consent in writing  
table of contents state that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board of directors  our chief executive officer  by the board of directors after a resolution is adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors  or by the holders of not less than of our outstanding voting stock  establish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting  provide that certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation can be amended only by supermajority vote of the outstanding shares and that our bylaws can be amended only by supermajority vote of the outstanding shares of our board of directors  allow our directors  not our stockholders  to fill vacancies on our board of directors  and provide that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors 
the company s board of directors has adopted a stockholder rights plan  which is described further in note stockholders equity of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report on form k 
the existence of this rights plan may also have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of our company or our management by deterring acquisitions of our stock not approved by our board of directors 
our clients may be confused by the change in our name to resources global professionals 
in january  our operating company began doing business as resources global professionals in order to better reflect our global capabilities across a base of more than  clients within countries and to avoid confusion with other companies using the name resources connection or some variation thereof 
however  some clients and prospective clients may be confused by this name change or may be unaware that resources connection and resources global professionals are the same company 
while we believe that the name change enhances our brand identity  there is a risk that confusion over the name change could cause our financial results to suffer 
we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  including our brand name 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  the value of such rights may diminish and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
we believe that establishing  maintaining and enhancing the resources global professionals brand name is essential to our business 
we have applied for us and foreign registrations on this new service mark 
we have previously obtained us registrations on our resources connection service mark and puzzle piece logo  registration no 
 registered december   no 
 registered january   and no 
 registered september  as well as certain foreign registrations 
we had been aware from time to time of other companies using the name resources connection or some variation thereof and this contributed to our decision to adopt the new operating company name of resources global professionals this year 
however  our rights to this service mark are not currently protected by any us or foreign registration  and there is no guarantee that any of our pending applications for such registration or any appeals thereof or future applications will be successful 
although we are not aware of other companies using the name resources global professionals at this time  there could be potential trade name or service mark infringement claims brought against us by the users of these similar names and marks and those users may have service mark rights that are senior to ours 
if these claims were successful  we could be forced to cease using the service mark resources global professionals even if an infringement claim is not brought against us 
it is also possible that our competitors or others will adopt service names similar to ours or that our clients will be confused by another company using a name  service mark or trademark similar to ours  thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity 
we cannot assure you that our business would not be adversely affected if confusion did occur or if we were required to change our name 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
at the end of fiscal  we had approximately million of cash  highly liquid short term investments and long term marketable securities 
securities that the company has the ability and positive intent to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost 
these securities consist of commercial paper and government agency bonds 
cost approximates market for these securities 
the earnings on these investments are subject to changes in interest rates  and to the extent interest rates were to decline  it would reduce our interest income 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
prior to fiscal  our foreign operations were not significant to our overall operations  and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk was low 
however  as our strategy to continue expanding foreign operations progresses  more of our revenues will be derived from foreign operations denominated in the currency of the applicable markets 
for the year ended may   approximately of the company s revenues were generated outside of the united states 
as a result  our operating results are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies in relation to the us dollar 
revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
thus  as the value of the us dollar fluctuates relative to the currencies in our us based operations  our reported results may vary 
assets and liabilities of our non us based operations are translated into us dollars at the exchange rate effective at the end of each monthly reporting period 
ninety three per cent of our fiscal year end balances of cash  short term investments and investments in marketable securities were denominated in us dollars 
the remaining was comprised primarily of cash balances translated from euros  british pounds or swedish krona 
the difference resulting from the translation each period of assets and liabilities of our non us based operations are recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive gain 
although we intend to monitor our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations  including the use of financial hedging techniques if and when we may deem it appropriate  we cannot assure you that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future
