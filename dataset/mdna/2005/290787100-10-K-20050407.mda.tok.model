item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form k 
this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
all of these statements are based on information available to us as of the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain risk factors including  but not limited to  those discussed under the heading factors that may affect future results 
executive overview we provide data management solutions that help organizations cost effectively build  optimize  test  and manage their critical data  database  and application infrastructures 
we earn revenues from the world wide sale of these software solutions and related maintenance and support services to corporations  government agencies  educational institutions  and other entities 
it budgets  as well as macroeconomic conditions  affect demand for our products 
in addition  our sales are impacted by competitive conditions  market acceptance of our product offerings  and our execution against sales plans 
we have historically derived a significant percentage of our revenues from our dbartisan product line 
this product line is expected to continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result of this revenue concentration  our business could be harmed by a decline in demand for  or in the prices of  this product line resulting from any change in our pricing model  maturation in the market for this product  increased price competition  or a failure by us to keep up with technological change  among other factors 
we sell our software in the united states and canada primarily through a direct sales force comprised of a telesales group and a field sales organization 
in recent years  the field sales organization has accounted for an increasing portion of overall revenues 
the field sales organization targets larger sales transactions and enterprise wide implementations of our products 
we have targeted these sales as part of our strategy to increase our revenues per customer and sell our products deeper onto our customers organizations 
the sales cycle for these sales can range from two to twelve months 
as a result  it is difficult to predict the period in which larger sales transactions will close and therefore adds additional risk to our quarterly revenue forecasts 
we also anticipate continued growth from international sales to meet our revenue projections  although we cannot at this time provide reliable guidance regarding the magnitude of that growth 
at the same time  we have experienced significant disruption eg employee turnover and increased expenses in our european subsidiary related to our restatement of financial results  which could negatively impact our business in the short term 
in   and the first half of  global economic conditions had a negative impact on it spending and affected sales of our products 
however  we saw an improvement in license sales in the second half of as customers seemed more willing to spend money to bolster their it infrastructures 
overall  proved to be a slightly better it spending environment than the prior year and  coupled with better sales execution in the us market and new product offerings  our total revenues increased to million and million for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively  as compared to million and million for the corresponding periods in 
table of contents most of our operating expenses are related to personnel and related overhead costs  facilities  outside research and development contractors  and legal and other professional service costs 
our operating expenses for the three and twelve months ended december   were million and million  respectively  as compared to million and million for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
we are involved in ongoing litigation and  depending on the activity in a given quarter  our litigation costs can vary materially from period to period 
our revenues for the three and twelve months ended december  increased  as compared to the same periods in the prior year  by and  respectively  while operating expenses increased by and  respectively  for the same comparable periods 
our cash flow from operations was approximately million for the twelve months ended december  cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments were million at december   which increased as compared to the december  balance of million 
our license and maintenance revenues  results of operations  cash flows from operations  and financial condition could be adversely affected in the future by a renewed downturn in global economic conditions  increased competitive pressures and our own inability to execute our sales plans 
restatements our audit committee recently completed an internal investigation focused on our revenue recognition practices related to transactions with certain distributors and resellers  principally those of our united kingdom subsidiary  embarcadero europe  which resulted in the restatement of our financial results for the three months ended march  and june   and the six months ended june  those restated financial statements were filed in amended quarterly reports on form q a on january  the audit committee engaged independent legal and accounting experts to assist it in conducting the investigation 
the cost of the investigation will be approximately million to million  of which million was recorded in operating expenses in the three month period ended december  approximately  to  of costs related to the investigation will be recorded in the three months ending march  we expect to incur additional costs as we implement the recommendations of our audit committee resulting from the investigation 
our results of operations presented in this annual report on form k also includes restated financial information for fiscal years through  as well as the quarters ended march  through september  resulting from errors that were identified with respect to the accounting for the impacts of foreign currencies and for income taxes 
more information regarding this restatement can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we expect to incur costs of approximately  to  in the three months ending march  related to our restatement for prior years 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the impacts and risks associated with our accounting policies are discussed throughout this annual 
table of contents report on form k and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates are those items that require significant judgment and or estimates by management at the time that financial statements are prepared such that materially different results might have been reported if other assumptions had been made 
below is further discussion of the items that we consider to be our critical accounting policies and estimates 
revenue recognition 
our revenues are principally derived from software license sales and related maintenance and support contracts 
customers that license our software products also generally purchase maintenance and support contracts that provide software updates and technical support over a stated term  usually one year 
revenues from maintenance and support contracts are paid for in advance and are recognized ratably over the contract term 
we primarily sell packaged software products that generally do not require us to perform any special installation or integration services 
we recognize revenues in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop we recognize revenues when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  typically upon shipment  when terms are fob shipping point  no significant implementation obligations by us remain  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we use a purchase order  a pre payment via check  wire or credit card  a signed license agreement  or other persuasive evidence as substantiation of an arrangement 
when processing a sales transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with the transaction is fixed and determinable and whether or not collection is probable 
we assess whether the fee is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are typically days from invoice date but in some cases may be or days  we account for the fee as not being fixed and determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not probable  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes probable  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
most customers are granted payment terms  but some payments are collected via check  wire  or credit card at the time an order is placed 
for arrangements with multiple elements eg  undelivered maintenance and support contracts and consulting and training services bundled with licenses  we allocate revenue to the delivered elements of the arrangement using the residual value method 
under the residual value method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
the vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the ongoing maintenance and support obligations for the licenses is based upon the prices paid for separate renewal of those services by similar customers 
vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for other services  primarily consulting and training services  is based upon separate sales of such services 
deferred maintenance and support revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance term  typically one year 
deferred revenue  which consists primarily of maintenance and support services that customers have contracted for in advance but for which revenue has not been recognized  is recognized as services are rendered or as other requirements requiring deferral under sop are satisfied 
our products are sold under a perpetual license model 
updates and upgrades to our products are made available to customers who have purchased maintenance and support contracts 
we do not recognize revenues for refundable fees or agreements with cancellation rights until such rights to refund or cancellation have expired 
our products may be sold through distributors or resellers in the united states and certain international markets 
revenues from software license fees sold through distributors or resellers are recognized on the sell through basis 
maintenance revenue sold through distributors and resellers is recognized ratably over the contractual post contract service pcs period 
distributors and resellers purchase products to fulfill specific customer orders and generally do not hold inventory of our products 
we also enter into arrangements with oems that provide for license fees based 
table of contents on inclusion of our products in their products 
these arrangements often provide for non refundable and upfront minimum royalty payments which are recognized as revenue either immediately or on a sell through basis when due  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
the oem arrangements usually include maintenance and support contracts 
we allocate revenues to the delivered elements of the arrangements using the residual value method based on the vsoe for undelivered items 
we intend to continue to expand our international sales activities in an effort to increase revenues from foreign sales 
we sell our software and related maintenance services directly through our telesales and field sales organizations in north america  the united kingdom and australia and indirectly through our distribution partners worldwide 
significant management judgment and estimates must be made in connection with the determination of the revenue to be recognized in any accounting period 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates for any period  material differences in the amount and timing of revenue recognized could result allowance for doubtful accounts and returns 
we establish allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts based on our review of credit profiles of our customers  contractual terms and conditions  current economic trends and historical payment  return and discount experience 
we reassess the allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts each period 
historically  our actual losses and credits have been consistent with these provisions 
however  unexpected events or significant future changes in trends could result in a material impact to our future statements of operations and of cash flows 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates for any period  material differences in the amount and timing of revenue or bad debt expense recognized could result 
our allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts as a percentage of net revenues were  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of activities during the years reported 
based on our results for the year ended december   a one percentage point deviation in our allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts as a percentage of net revenues would have resulted in an increase or decrease in revenue and or expense of approximately  capitalized research and development costs 
capitalized research and development costs include certain costs associated with acquiring and developing technology used in our licensed products 
research and development costs are capitalized in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  which requires capitalization of research and development costs once technological feasibility has been established through such time as the related product is generally available for sale 
we consider technological feasibility to have been established when a working model that includes all significant planned features and functionality exists 
accordingly  purchased technology is capitalized if it has reached technological feasibility at the time of acquisition  costs of developed technology are capitalized after technological feasibility is reached 
costs of purchased and developed technology are capitalized and amortized on a product by product basis over their remaining estimated useful lives at the greater of straight line or the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product 
amortization begins when technology is available for sale 
estimated useful lives of capitalized technology are generally three years 
our capitalized software costs were million  net at december  a discussion of our policies related to capitalized software can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements under the heading capitalized software development costs and further detail can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
lease related impairment loss 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  in we recorded a restructuring charge in connection with our abandonment of certain operating leases as part of a program to restructure our operations and related facilities 
lease abandonment costs were estimated to include the impairment of leasehold improvements  remaining net present value of the company s future contractual lease obligations  net of any sublease income and brokerage fees 
in  based on changes in the commercial real estate market in san francisco  we recorded an additional impairment charges to cover lower than estimated sublease 
table of contents income 
further  in  we recorded a second restructuring and impairment charge of million related to the consolidation of our office leases in san francisco 
the restructuring charge is primarily based on the net present value of the company s future contractual lease obligations net of any sublease income and any incidental expenses related to restructuring 
estimates related to sublease costs and income are based on assumptions about the time period required to locate and contract with suitable sub lessees as well as the sublease rates that can be achieved  as determined by market trend information analyses provided by a commercial real estate brokerage we retained 
we will continue to review these estimates each reporting period 
to the extent that these assumptions change due to unfavorable market conditions  the ultimate restructuring expenses for these abandoned facilities could increase 
accounting for income taxes 
in conjunction with preparing our consolidated financial statements  we must estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation and amortization  for financial reporting and tax reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance against our us net deferred tax assets 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a given period  we must increase the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
at december   we had gross deferred tax assets of million 
due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  consisting of colorado net operating loss carry forwards  we established a valuation allowance of approximately  the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of current and future taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
a detailed discussion of our income tax provision and the components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for deferred stock based compensation 
our stock based employee compensation plans are described more fully in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we account for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
and related interpretations 
deferred stock based compensation cost is reflected in net income loss  as some options and stock awards granted under those plans had an exercise price less than the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant  which is described more fully in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we amortize stock based compensation using the multiple option method over the remaining vesting periods of the related options and stock awards  which are generally four years 
pro forma information regarding net income loss and earnings per share is required in order to show our net income loss as if we had accounted for employee stock options and awards under the fair value method of sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 and is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of options and stock awards issued pursuant to the option plans at the grant date were estimated using the black scholes model 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility 
we use projected volatility rates  which are based upon historical volatility rates trended into future years 
because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our options 
the effects of applying pro forma disclosures of net income loss and earnings per share are not likely to be representative of the pro forma effects on net income loss and earnings per share in the future years for the 
table of contents following reasons the number of future shares to be issued under these plans is not known and the assumptions used to determine the fair value can vary significantly 
in december  fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment 
the new pronouncement replaces the existing requirements under sfas no 
and apb according to sfas no 
r  all forms of share based payments to employees  including employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans  would be treated the same as any other form of compensation by recognizing the related cost in the statement of operations 
this pronouncement eliminates the ability to account for stock based compensation transactions using apb no 
and generally would require instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
fasb concluded that for public companies sfas no 
r is effective for awards and stock options granted  modified or settled in cash in interim or annual periods beginning after june  sfas no 
r provides transition alternatives for public companies to restate prior interim periods or prior years 
the company expects the adoption of sfas r will have a material adverse impact on our net income and net income per share 
the company is currently in the process of evaluating the extent of such impact

table of contents years ended december    and revenues total revenues and year over year changes are as follows in thousands  except for percentages change change year ended december  amount percent amount percent revenues license maintenance total revenues total revenues 
total revenues increased for fiscal year compared to fiscal year  primarily due to a general increase in information technology spending and better sales execution in north america 
total revenues increased from to and is attributable to the growth in maintenance revenue related to the growth in our installed base 
license 
license revenue increased in compared to the increase was primarily due to a generally better information technology spending environment and increased license revenue generated in our north american region 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further detail on total revenue by region 
license revenue decreased in compared to  largely due to the global economic slowdown during that period and resulting reduction in information technology spending 
we expect that license revenues will remain relatively constant as a percentage of total revenue in maintenance 
maintenance revenue increased in compared to  primarily due to the increase in the cumulative number of licenses sold  a growing installed base  and constant maintenance renewals 
maintenance revenue increased in compared to  primarily as a result of additional maintenance revenue related to the growth in our installed base 
we expect that maintenance revenue will remain relatively constant as a percentage of total revenue in cost of revenues total cost of revenues 
total cost of revenues and year over year changes are as follows in thousands  except percentages change change year ended december  amount percent amount percent cost of revenues license amortization of acquired technology maintenance total cost of revenues license 
cost of license revenues consists primarily of amortization of capitalized research and development expenses  royalties  credit card merchant fees  product media and packaging and shipping 
cost of license revenues were million   and  for  and  respectively 
the absolute dollar and percentage of total revenues increased from to were primarily due to an increase of approximately  in amortization expense related to capitalized research and development expenses  and an increase of approximately  for royalties  offset by a decrease of approximately  related to lower product media and packaging costs 
amortization expense for capitalized research and development costs is expected to be approximately  in the absolute dollar increase from to was due primarily to a  increase in amortization expense related to capitalized research and development expenses for a product that came to market in this increase was partially offset by a  reduction in product media and packaging 
amortization of acquired technology 
amortization of acquired technology expense was million  million and million in   and  respectively 
the expense is primarily related to technology acquired in 
table of contents the acquisition of advanced software technologies  inc in and additional technology acquisitions in and the increase from to was due to a full year of amortization for the technology put into service in the decrease in was due to the completion of amortization in the fourth quarter of we expect there to be no amortization of acquired technology expense in maintenance 
cost of maintenance revenues consists primarily of customer support personnel and related expenses  including payroll  employee benefits  and allocated overhead 
the decrease in cost of maintenance as a percentage of revenues from to to was due primarily to the increase in maintenance revenues from period to period while the number of related personnel remained flat  allowing us to realize economies of scale through increased utilization of our customer support personnel 
we expect to hire more support personnel to support our expanding product line and customer base 
when we hire such personnel  we expect cost of maintenance revenues to increase in absolute dollars and potentially to increase as a percentage of maintenance revenues if the additional personnel are hired in advance of an increase in the related revenues 
operating expenses total operating expense 
total operating expenses were million  million  and million for   and  respectively  representing an increase of from to and a decrease of from to change change year ended december  amount percent amount percent operating expenses research and development purchased research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of other intangible assets restructuring and impairment charges total operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses  including payroll  employee benefits  allocated overhead  and non cash stock based compensation  as well as expenses related to outside software development contractors 
domestic costs decreased  due to lower headcount and a reduced overhead expense allocation based on our restructuring in q canadian development lab costs increased  due to increased operating costs including an unfavorable currency exchange cost of  we anticipate that we will continue to invest significant resources into research and development activities in order to develop new product and advance the technology of our existing products 
we expect to continue to benefit from cost efficiencies related to expanding the research and development activities of our canadian subsidiary 
the absolute dollar increase from to was primarily due to an increase of  related to increased headcount in our canadian development lab  which led to higher personnel expenses  overhead costs  bonus payments  as well as an unfavorable currency exchange rate impact of  there was also an increase of approximately  in recruiting fees and approximately  in increased software maintenance expense 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives and  as such  we expect that spending on research and development in will be consistent in absolute dollars with purchased research and development 
purchased research and development consists of technology purchased from third parties 
from time to time  we may purchase technology to supplement our research and development efforts and to leverage the resources available to us 
such purchases are for the rights  titles  and interest in the technology 
if we determine that the purchased software has not reached technological feasibility  we expense the cost of the technology in the year of the purchase see capitalized software development costs in note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of when purchased technology is expensed versus capitalized 
in  we spent million to purchase technology that had not reached technological feasibility 
the technology was subsequently integrated into our products in  and there are no related contractual obligations 
table of contents for future purchases of technology 
no comparable expense was incurred in or we may choose to purchase additional technology in the future based on our development needs and our decisions to internally build technology versus purchase technology from third parties 
our past purchases and integration of research and development did not create a material strain on our financial or personnel resources 
however  if we choose to purchase additional research and development in the future  such purchases may have a material effect on our financial and or personnel resources 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses  commissions earned by sales personnel  non cash stock based compensation  trade shows  travel  and other marketing communication costs  such as advertising and other marketing programs 
the increase in absolute dollars from to was primarily due to a million increase in wages and related costs  including  increase in non cash stock based compensation 
international sales and marketing costs attributable to the uk and australia increased  due to increased headcount and unfavorable currency exchange rates 
excluding stock based compensation  the absolute dollar increase from to was primarily due to a  increase in expense in our european subsidiary as a result of an increase in the average exchange rate for the pound sterling 
in  we reduced marketing expenses  both personnel related and discretionary marketing expenses  which was offset by higher personnel related expenses for sales resulting primarily from increased wages and commissions 
we intend to selectively increase staff in our sales organization and to create select marketing programs and  accordingly  expect that sales and marketing expenditures will increase in absolute dollars in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  general operating expenses  and non cash stock based compensation 
the increase in absolute dollars from to was primarily due to million related to the costs of the audit committee investigation that led to a restatement of our financial results for the three months ended march  and the three and six months ended june   an increase in non cash stock based compensation of approximately  a  increase in litigation expense  and  in professional services related to sarbanes oxley compliance requirements 
international general and administrative expenses increased by  related to professional services fees for accounting  tax services  and personnel recruitment 
excluding stock based compensation  the absolute dollar increase from to was due to a  increase in legal fees primarily attributable to the legal matter discussed in item legal proceedings  a  increase in personnel related expenses  and a  increase in professional service and insurance expenses  partially offset by a  decrease in expenses for our european subsidiary  primarily due to lower personnel related costs  and a  decrease in bad debt expense 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase in the near future  as we continue to incur costs to comply with the additional rules and regulations promulgated by the sarbanes oxley act  the securities and exchange commission  and the nasdaq national market 
these increased costs will include the hiring of additional personnel  as well as costs associated with outside legal counsel  accounting and advisory services 
further  we expect to incur additional costs as we continue to implement the recommendations of our audit committee resulting from the investigations related to our recent financial restatements 
we are also involved in ongoing litigation and  depending on the activity in a given quarter  our litigation costs can vary materially from period to period 
in addition  we expect to incur additional costs of approximately  to  related to the audit committee investigation and approximately  to  in the three months ending march  related to our restatement of prior years 
see note amortization of other intangible assets 
in connection with the acquisitions of advanced software technologies  inc  engineeringperformance  inc  and the remaining of embarcadero europe ltd  we recorded million of goodwill and other intangible assets in the fourth quarter of relating to non technology intangible assets acquired  we recorded million of amortization expense in as an operating expense 
these assets were fully amortized as of december  we ceased amortization of goodwill when we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
effective january  see goodwill in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test on september  the results of the analysis showed that goodwill was not impaired 
going forward  we will test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or in the event of a significant change in our business 
if  in the future  we determine that this goodwill 
table of contents is impaired  we will be required to take a charge at the date of impairment to write down this asset 
the dollar amount of such potential future charge  if any  cannot currently be estimated 
restructuring and impairment charges 
in  we recorded an impairment loss of million related to office leases in san francisco and boston when we decided to abandon and sublease these office spaces in order to streamline operations 
the impairment loss consists of approximately million in contractual obligations under the facilities leases  net of estimated sublease income from the projected date of abandonment to the end of the lease term 
the remaining  consists of write downs to leasehold improvements and other assets attributable to the abandoned space  as well as other expenses related to securing the sublease arrangements 
when we recorded the lease related impairment loss  we made estimates about sublease costs and income 
in  based on changes in the commercial real estate market in san francisco  we recorded an additional  in impairment loss to cover lower than expected sublease income 
at december   we had a balance of  in accrued restructuring costs for future facilities lease charges 
in april  we entered into a non cancelable five year operating lease agreement for our headquarters in san francisco  california 
the objectives of entering into this new lease agreement were to consolidate our two offices in san francisco  eliminate excess office space within san francisco and improve our operating efficiencies 
in conjunction with the execution of the new lease  we subleased our other san francisco long term lease contract 
the sublease agreements co terminate along with the master lease to which they are subject in july as a result  we recorded restructuring and impairment charges of million during the year ended december  the charges were comprised of three elements the net present value of approximately million relating to the future contractual lease obligation  an impairment loss of approximately  relating to abandoned leasehold improvements  and approximately  related to other contractual restructuring expenses  including tenant improvement allowances and brokerage and legal fees 
if our subtenants were to stop paying the sublease income  we could be required to record another restructuring charge 
the amount of that charge cannot be estimated at this time 
a summary of the restructuring accrual is as follows in thousands facility leases  net of sublease income write down of leasehold improvements other restructuring expenses total initial loss charged to accrual non cash expenses accrual as of december  net cash payments accrual as of december  restructuring and impairment charges during the three months ended june  non cash reductions of accrual net cash payments during the year ended december  accrual as of december  other income  net 
other income  net consists primarily of interest income and was   and  in   and  respectively 
the increase from to was due to an increase in market interest rates and investments in longer term maturities yielding higher interest rates 
the decrease from to was due to significant decreases in market interest rates  which negatively impacted our interest income 
provision for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
sfas no 
provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
provision for income taxes was  million  and  in   and  respectively 
the effective income tax rate was   and in   and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a decrease in income before income taxes and a benefit received from disqualifying dispositions of employee stock options for which stock based compensation was 
table of contents recognized in previous periods 
the increase from to was primarily due to the increase in income before taxes 
the exercise and sale of incentive stock options typically creates disqualifying dispositions which benefits the overall corporate tax rate 
it is impossible to forecast the exercise of our outstanding common stock options or the disqualifying dispositions associated with them 
the benefits received from the disqualifying dispositions can only be considered in calculating a company s tax rate in the period in which they are realized 
in the past  our effective tax rate has been reduced due to the occurrence of such disqualifying dispositions 
we had net deferred tax assets totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
in addition  at december   we had federal and state net operating loss carry forwards nols of approximately million and million  respectively 
these nols can be carried forward to offset future taxable income  if any 
our federal and state net operating loss carry forwards expire in through  if not utilized 
at december   we had federal  state and foreign research and development credits of approximately million   and  respectively 
the federal credits expire in through the foreign credits expire in through the state credits do not expire 
we will continue to evaluate our ability to realize deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in the event that actual results differ from our estimates  we will adjust such estimates in the future periods  and we may also need to adjust the effective rate for the current year 
in october  the president signed the american jobs creation act of the act 
the act creates a temporary incentive for u 
s corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
the deduction is subject to a number of limitations and  as of today  uncertainly remains as to how to interpret numerous provisions in the act 
the provisions of the act do not impact the financial statements under current accounting rules 
the company will evaluate the impact of the act once the final guidance is issued

in  cash provided by operating activities resulted from million in net income  million in non cash adjustments primarily comprised of depreciation  amortization and deferred stock based compensation charges  as well as a million net change in operating assets and liabilities 
the net change in operating assets and liabilities is primarily due to an increase in accrued restructuring charge of million related to our restructuring in the second quarter of and an increase of million in deferred revenue due a larger installed customer base and related increase in maintenance renewals 
in  cash provided by operating activities resulted from million in net income  million in non cash adjustments primarily comprised of depreciation  amortization  and deferred stock based compensation  as well as a million net change in operating assets and liabilities 
the net change in operating assets and liabilities is primarily due to a million increase in deferred revenue due a larger installed customer base and related increase in maintenance renewals 
to the extent that non cash items increase or decrease our future operating results  there will be no corresponding impact on our cash flows 
the non cash adjustments include depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and intangible assets  as well as amortization of deferred stock based compensation and tax benefits for the exercise of certain employee stock options 
these non cash adjustments may increase or decrease and  as a result  positively or negatively impact our future operating results 
in  the non cash adjustments were mainly due to million in non cash stock based compensation expense  million in amortization of developed technology   in amortization of other intangibles   of impairment charges  offset by a million decrease in deferred tax assets other than non cash items  our primary source of operating cash flows is the collection of accounts receivable from our customers 
we measure the effectiveness of our collections efforts by an analysis of average accounts receivable daily sales outstanding dso 
collection of accounts receivable and related dso could fluctuate in the future periods due to timing and amount of our revenues and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
in the future  collections could also fluctuate based upon the payment terms we extend to our customers 
in the past  our payment terms have typically been net thirty days 
our dso for the three months ended december   and were days  days and days  respectively 
our operating cash flows may be impacted in the future by the timing of payments to our vendors for accounts payable 
we typically pay our vendors and service providers in accordance with their invoice terms and conditions 
the timing of cash payments in future periods will be impacted by the nature of accounts payable arrangements and management s assessment of our cash inflows

we expect to continue to acquire such investments in the future and receive proceeds from them as they mature or are sold 
also included in cash used for investing activities were purchases of property and equipment  payments of principal under capital lease obligations  and technology acquired and developed 
for the year ended december  and  purchases of property and equipment were million and million  respectively 
we entered into a  three year capital lease agreement in june with a financial institution to finance acquisition of certain furniture and fixtures and computer equipment 
the capital lease agreement bears interest of per annum and has a buyout at its expiration in june it is likely we will enter into additional capital lease arrangements as long as interest rates remain attractive

table of contents in september  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to  shares of our common stock 
in july  our board of directors amended the stock repurchase program  allowing us to repurchase up to  shares in addition to the shares previously repurchased 
the board of directors increased the number of shares authorized for purchase by one million shares in both july and october the main use of cash in financing activities during the year ended december  was the repurchase of approximately million shares of our outstanding stock for million 
in the years ended december   and  we repurchased approximately  and  shares  respectively  at a cost of approximately million  and million  respectively 
thus  including the increase in authorized shares to repurchase in october  we have approximately million shares available for repurchase at december  the timing of future repurchases and the price paid for the shares could have a material impact on our liquidity 
we have no immediate plans for use of our previously repurchased shares 
a summary of the repurchase program is as follows number of shares cost of repurchase average cost thousands thousands initial repurchase program authorized in september increased in repurchase program authorized in july increased in repurchase program authorized in july increased in repurchase program authorized in october total authorized for repurchase shares repurchased in shares repurchased in shares repurchased in shares repurchased in total shares repurchased remaining shares available for repurchase at december  this use of cash was offset in   and by million  million  and  respectively  provided by exercises of stock options under our equity compensation plans 
our future liquidity and capital resources could be impacted by the exercise of outstanding common stock options and the cash proceeds we receive upon exercise of these securities 
further  we have approximately million shares available to issue under our current plans 
the timing of the issuance  the duration of their vesting provision and the grant price will all impact the timing of any proceeds 
however  we cannot estimate the amount of such proceeds at this time 
furthermore  the company suspended all exercises of stock options under each of its equity compensation plans from november  through january  this suspension was required because the company s periodic reports are incorporated by reference into the registration statements for the securities issuable under each such equity compensation plan 
the company has extended the exercisability of all options that would otherwise have terminated during that period for a period of time equal to that during which the options were not exercisable due to the suspension 
the company does not believe that this extension will have a material impact on its future cash flows 
in august  we terminated our million revolving credit facility with a financial institution 
we did not intend to utilize this line of credit due to our liquidity position 
the financial institution issued an irrevocable standby letter of credit for approximately  in relation to a real estate lease agreement executed in april the standby letter of credit expires on june  our contractual obligations consisted of facility lease commitments  operating leases for office equipment  and capital leases for property and equipment 
in april  we announced a restructuring plan  and  as a part of that plan  we entered in to a new five year lease commitment and subleased the remainder of our long term san francisco 
table of contents office leases 
gross lease payment obligations under the non cancelable operating and capital lease are as follows in thousands year ending december  capital lease operating leases bank letter of credit total thereafter total minimum payments less amount representing interest present value of net minimum lease payments we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to finance our operations through at least the next to months 
if we fail to generate cash flow from operations in the future due to an unexpected decline in revenues or due to a sustained increase in cash expenditures in excess of revenues generated  our cash balances may not be sufficient to fund continuing operations without obtaining additional financing 
if additional financing is needed  there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in march  the fasb issued eitf issue no 
eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which provides new guidance for assessing impairment losses on investments 
additionally  eitf includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb delayed the accounting provisions of eitf  however  the disclosure requirements remain effective for annual periods ending after june  we have complied with the disclosure requirements and will evaluate the impact of eitf once the final guidance is issued 
in december  fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment 
the new pronouncement replaces the existing requirements under sfas no 
and apb according to sfas no 
r  all forms of share based payments to employees  including employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans  would be treated the same as any other form of compensation by recognizing the related cost in the statement of operations 
this pronouncement eliminates the ability to account for stock based compensation transactions using apb no 
and generally would require that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method  with a binomial or lattice model preferred to the black scholes valuation model 
the lattice model can explicitly capture expected changes in dividends and stock volatility over the expected life of the options  in contrast to the black scholes option pricing model  which uses weighted average assumptions about option pricing 
for public companies  fasb has determined that sfas no 
r is effective for awards and stock options granted  modified or settled in cash in interim or annual periods beginning after june  sfas no 
r provides transition alternatives for public companies to restate prior interim periods or prior years 
the company expects the adoption of sfas r will have a material adverse impact on our net income and net income per share 
the company is currently in the process of evaluating the extent of such impact 
in december  fasb issued sfas  exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment to apb opinion no 

this statement amends apb to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents in december  fasb staff position no 
fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp fas was issued  providing guidance under sfas  accounting for income taxes for recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of  enacted on october  fsp fas allows time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effects of the jobs act before applying the requirements of fsp fas accordingly  we are evaluating the potential effects of the jobs act and have not adjusted our tax expense or deferred tax liability as of december  factors that may affect future results in addition to other information in this report  the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the company 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or currently deem immaterial may also become important factors that may harm our business 
we have restated our previously issued financial statements and have material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that require remediation 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act  we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective at december  this annual report on form k includes restated consolidated financial information for fiscal years through  as well as for the first three quarters of this restatement of financial information results from errors that were identified with respect to the accounting for the impact of foreign currencies and for income taxes 
we have concluded that these errors constitute material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
the existence of one or more material weaknesses at december  precludes us from concluding that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december  in addition  as previously announced  following the third quarter of  our audit committee conducted an internal investigation focused on our revenue recognition practices related to transactions with certain distributors and resellers  principally those of our united kingdom subsidiary  embarcadero europe 
upon completion of this investigation  we concluded that it was necessary to restate our financial statements to properly reflect sales to certain distributors and resellers on a sell through basis  which is consistent with our revenue recognition policy  for the quarters ended march and june  this restatement resulted from a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting with respect to the reporting of transactions principally conducted by embarcadero europe 
following discovery of the material weakness  we have taken steps  including replacing certain employees of our uk subsidiary and appointing a new controller as of march  to strengthen our internal controls over financial reporting to prevent the recurrence of the circumstances that resulted in our determination to restate prior period financial statements 
because we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective at december   we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and a loss of public confidence in our internal controls 
in addition  any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to timely meet our regulatory reporting obligations 
any of these failures could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock 
further  implementation of remediation procedures related to the material weaknesses will consume management s attention and result in increased general and administrative expenses 
in addition  this annual report on form k and our quarterly report on form q for the third quarter of were not filed within the time periods required by the rules of the securities and exchange commission 
as a result  we are deemed to be untimely in our reporting obligations and will thus be unable for a period of time to utilize certain forms for the registration of securities or other purposes 
for example  only after being current in our public reporting obligations for a period of one year currently anticipated to be april will we be eligible to utilize form s for the registration of securities 

table of contents we must meet ongoing stringent requirements of nasdaq to maintain the listing of our common stock in the nasdaq national market 
as previously announced  the nasdaq stock market notified us on november  that our securities were subject to delisting from the nasdaq national market due to our failure to timely file a form q for the third quarter of we requested an oral hearing before a nasdaq listing qualifications panel the nasdaq panel to appeal the delisting proceedings and request additional time to file the form q 
this oral hearing occurred on december  the nasdaq panel took no action at that time 
we filed the required form q for the third quarter of  along with forms q a for the quarters ended march  and june   all on january  by letter dated january   we received the determination of the panel granting our request for continued listing in the nasdaq national market  subject to the condition that we timely file all required periodic reports for all reporting periods ending on or before december  our failure to timely file this annual report on form k resulted in non compliance with the determination of the nasdaq panel 
in its determination  the panel reserved the right to reconsider the terms of the continued listing exception 
the untimely filing of this annual report on form k increases the risk that the nasdaq panel would reconsider our continued listing 
because of the untimely filing of this form k or if we otherwise fail to comply with nasdaq s requirements for continued listing  we could be subject to immediate delisting 
the delisting of our common stock would significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and would significantly negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate in future periods  and  as a result  our stock price may fluctuate or decline 
our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter 
we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our historical results of operations are not indicative of our future performance 
our revenues and operating results may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  including the factors discussed below under the captions increased costs associated with corporate governance compliance and our audit committee investigation may significantly impact the results of our operations  litigation could continue to increase our general and administrative expenditures and harm our business  if sales of our dbartisan fall  our revenues and income may decline  if our products do not perform as expected  we may lose customers  our costs will increase and revenues may be delayed or lost  if we do not generate new business from our existing customers and add new customers  we will not be able to sustain or increase our revenues  our operating results would be harmed if the recovery in information technology spending does not continue  we invest heavily in research and development with no guarantee of return from the investments that we make  if we are not able to enhance our existing products to adapt to rapid technological change  or we introduce new products that do not achieve market acceptance  our revenues and earnings may suffer and we may experience loss of market share  large sales of our products and maintenance involve a lengthy sales cycle and are unpredictable  which could cause delays in recognizing revenue or the failure to obtain revenue  our high fixed operating expenses might adversely affect our profitability if future revenue expectations are not met  if our products do not perform as expected  we may lose customers  our costs will increase and revenues may be delayed or lost  and we may be required to change our revenue recognition policies based on changing implementation guidelines and interpretations  which could cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly 
seasonal variations in orders for our products also contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
these fluctuations are likely to cause corresponding volatility in our stock price  particularly if our operating results vary from analysts expectations 

table of contents increased costs associated with corporate governance compliance and our audit committee investigation may significantly impact the results of our operations 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance  public disclosure and compliance practices  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nasdaq national market rules  are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours in understanding and complying with these laws  regulations and standards 
as a result of this uncertainty and other factors  devoting the necessary resources to comply with evolving corporate governance and public disclosure standards will result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention to compliance activities 
we also expect these developments to increase our legal compliance and financial reporting costs 
in addition  these developments may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain such coverage 
moreover  we may not be able to comply with these new rules and regulations on a timely basis 
these developments could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  or qualified executive officers 
we have incurred significant costs to date in connection with our efforts to comply with regulatory requirements  notably section of the sarbanes oxley act of as a result  our general and administrative expenses have increased and we expect this trend to continue in the near term 
additionally  we have incurred significant legal  accounting and consulting costs in connection with our recent audit committee investigation 
the cost of the investigation conducted by the audit committee of our board of directors will be approximately million to million  of which million was recorded in operating expenses in the three month period ended december  as a result  our results of operations for the quarter ended december  were adversely affected 
the remainder of such expenses is being recorded in the first quarter of  and this will negatively affect our results of operations for that quarter 
in addition  we will continue to incur increased general and administrative expenses as we implement  test and refine our internal control over financial reporting and recruit new personnel into our finance organization 
litigation could continue to increase our general and administrative expenditures and harm our business 
we have been subject to lawsuits as part of our normal course of business  including the suit brought against us by the client server factory relating to our acquisition of engineering performance  inc in november this litigation is still pending and has contributed to an increase in our general and administrative expenses in the defense of this lawsuit could also result in the diversion of our management s time and attention away from business operations  which could harm our business 
in addition  litigation is expensive and unpredictable and could harm our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
if sales of dbartisan fall  our revenues and income may decline 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales of our dbartisan product 
for the year ended december   dbartisan and dbartisan add on products accounted for more than of our license revenues 
this continues a trend that held true for and we expect that sales of dbartisan will continue to represent a substantial portion of our license revenues for the foreseeable future 
in addition  many of our customers initiate a relationship with us by purchasing dbartisan 
if demand for dbartisan declines due to competition  technological change or other factors  our revenues and income may decline significantly 
if our products do not perform as expected  we may lose customers  our costs will increase and revenues may be delayed or lost 
computer software such as ours often contains undetected errors and may contain design flaws 
errors may be found in current versions  new versions  or enhancements of our products after we make commercial shipments 
if our software contains undetected errors  performs unreliably  or if we otherwise fail to meet our customers expectations  we may suffer loss of revenues  market share or customers  negative publicity and harm to our reputation  diversion of research and development and management resources  increased maintenance and warranty costs  legal actions by customers against us  and increased insurance costs 

table of contents if we do not generate new business from our existing customers and add new customers from our new or existing products  we will not be able to sustain or increase our revenues 
our license arrangements generally do not provide for substantial ongoing license or maintenance payments 
therefore  our future revenue growth depends on our success in expanding our relationships with existing customers and attracting new customers 
our ability to expand our relationships with existing customers and attract new customers will depend on a variety of factors  including the performance  quality  breadth  and depth of our current and future products and maintenance 
our failure to expand relationships with existing customers or to add new customers would reduce our future license and maintenance revenues 
in addition  if our existing customers do not renew their support contracts  our future maintenance revenues will be adversely affected 
our operating results would be harmed if the recovery of information technology spending does not continue 
the markets into which we sell our products are cyclical and are subject to general economic conditions 
although the information technology market has recovered since the second half of and was generally better in  economic conditions remain uncertain and the recovery may not be sustained 
any renewed slowdowns in the database market or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and our results of operations would be harmed 
if we are not able to attract and retain qualified personnel  our business will not be able to grow 
our success depends on the continued service of our executive officers and other key administrative  sales and marketing  research and development  and support personnel 
none of our executive officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term  and we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies 
as a result of the recently completed investigation by the audit committee of our board of directors  we are recruiting new personnel for our finance and sales organization 
our business will not be able to grow if we cannot fill these positions and attract  retain  and motivate other qualified personnel 
competition for qualified employees remains intense and we may not be able to attract  assimilate  or retain highly qualified personnel in the future 
there has been in the past and there may also be in the future a shortage of personnel that possess the technical background necessary to sell  support  and develop our products effectively 
it has also become more difficult to recruit qualified financial personnel since the new laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance  public disclosure are financial reporting 
some of our current employees and those that we seek to hire may be subject to non competition or non solicitation covenants that could further limit our ability to attract or retain qualified personnel 
our financial statements have been and could again be impacted by unauthorized and improper actions of our personnel 
as we have recently experienced with our restatement for the quarters ended march and june   our financial statements can be adversely impacted by our employees errant or improper actions 
for instance  revenue recognition depends on  among other criteria  the terms negotiated in our contracts with our customers 
our personnel may act outside of their authority and negotiate additional terms without our knowledge which could impact our ability to recognize revenue in a timely manner 
for instance  in the event that our sales personnel have negotiated terms that do not appear in the contract and of which we are unaware  whether the additional terms are written or oral  we could be prevented from recognizing revenue in accordance with our policy 
furthermore  depending on when we learn of unauthorized actions and the size of transactions involved  we may have to restate our financial statements for a previously reported period  which could seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we have implemented new controls to prevent such conduct  but we cannot be certain that these new controls will be effective 
we invest heavily in research and development with no guarantee of return from the investments that we make 
we have invested significant resources in the development of new products 
if our new products are not accepted in the marketplace  we may not achieve future revenue growth and may have limited return on the investments that we have made 
in addition  we plan to continue to invest in research and development and could fail to achieve expected returns from future investments 

table of contents if we are not able to enhance our existing products to adapt to rapid technological change  or we introduce new products that do not achieve market acceptance  our revenues and earnings may suffer and we may experience loss of market share 
the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent product introductions and enhancements  uncertain product lifecycles  and changes in customer demands and industry standards 
our success depends on our ability to continue to enhance our current products  introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments and market conditions  satisfy increasingly complicated customer requirements  integrate our products with multiple database platforms  and modify our products as database platforms change 
however  due to the nature of computing environments  new products and product enhancements could require longer development and testing periods than we currently anticipate 
moreover  if we develop new products that do not achieve market acceptance  we may not be able to recoup development and marketing expenses  which could harm our operating results 
the introduction of new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards may render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
delays in the general availability of new releases or problems in the installation or implementation of new releases could harm our business and operating results 
we may not be successful in developing and marketing  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products or new product enhancements that respond to technological change  evolving industry standards  or customer requirements 
our failure to do so would render our products obsolete and could harm our ability to compete 
in addition  our products and product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance 
large sales of our products and maintenance involve a lengthy sales cycle  which could cause delays in recognizing revenue or the failure to obtain revenue 
since  large sales of our products and maintenance to individual customers have increased 
this is due to our efforts to sell larger packages of our traditional software  as well as the introduction of new products that have significantly higher starting prices and longer evaluation periods than our traditional products 
these large sales typically involve sales cycles between six and twelve months  which is considerably longer than our sales cycle prior to this lengthy sales cycle is due to the need to educate and convince prospective customers of the value of our products and to gain approval from more constituencies within a prospective account  including key management personnel 
the timing of our revenues has become more difficult to forecast because of this lengthy sales cycle for large sales 
we may expend substantial time and resources to negotiate transactions with prospective customers but then be delayed in concluding  or be unable to conclude  sales of our products and maintenance 
any delay in  or failure to complete  sales in a particular period would reduce our revenues in that period as well as in subsequent periods over which revenues for the sale may be recognized 
if we were to experience a delay on one or more large orders  it could harm our ability to meet our forecasts for a given period 
if our sales cycle unexpectedly lengthens in general or for one or more large sales  it could negatively affect the timing of our revenues and may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from period to period 
our high fixed operating expenses might adversely affect our profitability if future revenue expectations are not met 
the majority of our operating expenses consist of personnel and related expenses and facility related costs 
these costs are relatively fixed in the short term  and our operating decisions such as when to hire additional personnel and when to expand our facilities and infrastructure are based in large part on expectations about expected future revenues 
if we hire personnel and enter into facilities contracts based on our expectations about future revenues  and then fail to meet those revenue expectations  we would likely have lower than expected earnings per share  which would negatively affect our stock price 

table of contents we may have future non recurring charges in the event of goodwill impairment 
we adopted sfas no 
on january   and  as a result  we ceased to amortize goodwill 
we now test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or in the event of a significant change in our business 
we performed our last impairment test in september and determined that there had been no impairment to our goodwill 
at december   our goodwill balance was million 
in the future  if we determine that this goodwill has been impaired  we will be required to take a non recurring charge to write down this asset  which would adversely affect our earnings and book value 
we may be required to change our revenue recognition policies based on changing implementation guidelines and interpretations  which may cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly 
in recent years  software revenue recognition rules have been under heavy review and interpretation by various accounting authoritative and regulatory bodies  including the american institute for certified public accountants and the financial accounting standards board 
these reviews and interpretations have resulted in significant changes in the practices and standards for recognizing revenues in software companies 
there could be further changes in these standards 
we may have to change our methods of revenue recognition to comply with new standards  and any such change could cause deferment of revenues recognized in current periods to subsequent periods or accelerated recognition of deferred revenue to current periods  such changes might cause shortfalls in meeting securities analysts and investors expectations in any period 
any such shortfalls could have an adverse impact on our stock price 
the expansion of our international operations exposes us to risks 
we expect to continue to expand our international sales and research and development operations 
as a result  we could face a number of risks from our expanding international operations staffing and managing foreign operations  complying with increased financial accounting and reporting complexities  including implementing effective internal controls across international operations  potentially adverse tax consequences  the loss of revenues and net income resulting from currency fluctuations  compliance with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties  the impact of war or terrorist activities  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  licenses  tariffs and other trade barriers  longer sales and payment cycles  and costs and difficulties of customizing products for foreign countries 
further expansion of our international operations may require significant management attention and financial resources and may place burdens on our management  administrative  operational and financial infrastructure 
our possible investments to establish facilities in other countries may not produce desired levels of revenues or profitability  which would negatively affect our stock price 
we may lose market share and be required to reduce prices as a result of competition from our existing competitors and other independent software vendors and developers of software 
the market for our products is highly competitive  dynamic  and subject to rapidly changing technology 
pricing pressure in the market has increased as competitors have lowered prices and engaged in more aggressive discounting 
if such pricing pressure continues  it could have an adverse effect on our margins 
we compete primarily against other providers of data and database management  data performance and availability  enterprise data design and modeling  and data movement technologies  which include computer associates  quest software  bmc software  ibm rational software  borland software corporation  informatica corporation  ascential software  and other independent software vendors 
our products also compete with products offered by database software manufacturers  including oracle  microsoft  sybase and ibm 
some of these competing products are provided at no charge to their customers 
we expect that companies such as oracle  microsoft  sybase  and ibm will continue to develop and incorporate into their products applications which compete with our products and may take advantage of their substantial technical  financial  marketing and distribution resources in those efforts 
we may 
table of contents not be able to compete effectively with those products or efforts  which could significantly harm our business and operating results 
there has been consolidation in our industry  such as ibm s acquisition of rational software and borland software corporation s acquisition of togethersoft 
these and any future acquisitions may have the effect of improving the competitive positions of the acquired companies and weakening our competitive situation 
to effectively compete as the industry consolidates  we may need to seek alliances with other companies in order to gain better acceptance of our products 
we may not be able to enter into such alliances on terms favorable to us or at all 
in addition  if the market for application and data lifecycle management products grows  some of our competitors may increase their focus on offering software directly competitive with ours  whether by internal development  external development  or acquisition 
our competitors may also attempt to keep us from integrating our software with theirs  making it more difficult for our customers to adopt our software 
if such increased competition were to result in resistance to integration of our software with the software of these competitors  we may have difficulty entering markets where our competitors have strong market positions 
further  if a single database platform were to gain a considerably larger share of the database market than other database platforms  we would lose our multi platform competitive advantage and our sales would suffer 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  and greater name recognition than we do 
they also may be able to respond more quickly than we can to changes in technology or customer requirements 
competition could seriously impede our ability to sell additional products on acceptable terms 
our competitors may pursue the following actions develop and market new technologies that render our products obsolete  unmarketable or otherwise less competitive  make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with other companies  thereby enhancing the functionality of their products  or establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with channel or strategic partners which limit our ability to sell or to co market products through these channels 
competitive pressures could reduce our market share  reduce customer orders  reduce gross margins  or require us to reduce our prices  any of which would harm our operating results 
international political instability may increase our cost of doing business and disrupt our business 
continued international political instability  evidenced by the threat or occurrence of terrorist attacks  enhanced national security measures  sustained military action in afghanistan and iraq  strained international relations with foreign governments and other international conflicts  may halt or hinder our ability to do business  may increase our costs  and may adversely affect our stock price 
this continued instability may  for example  negatively impact the reliability and cost of transportation  negatively affect the desire of our employees and customers to travel  adversely affect our ability to obtain adequate insurance at reasonable rates  or require us to take extra security precautions for our domestic and international operations 
in addition  this international political instability has had and may continue to have negative effects on financial markets  including significant price and volume fluctuations in securities markets 
if this international political instability continues or escalates  our business and results of operations could be harmed and the market price of our common stock could decline 
our proprietary rights may be inadequately protected and infringement claims or independent development of competing technologies could harm our competitive position 
we rely on copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures  and contractual provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we also enter into confidentiality agreements with employees and consultants and attempt to restrict access to proprietary information on a need to know basis 
despite such precautions  unauthorized third parties may be able to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we consider as proprietary 
we license our software products primarily under shrink wrap licenses delivered electronically with our software products 
shrink wrap licenses are not negotiated with or signed by individual licensees and purport to take effect 
table of contents upon installation of the product or downloading of the product from the internet 
these measures afford only limited protection 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software exists 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as well as the laws of the united states 
we may have to enter into litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others with respect to our rights 
litigation is generally very expensive and can divert the attention of management from daily operations 
accordingly  any intellectual property litigation could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 
further  the cost we may need to incur in connection with the defense of such lawsuits  if significant  could harm our financial condition 
we are not aware of any case in which we are infringing the proprietary rights of others 
however  third parties may bring infringement claims against us 
any such claim is likely to be time consuming and costly to defend  could cause product delays and could force us to enter into unfavorable royalty or license agreements with third parties 
a successful infringement claim against us could require us to enter into a license or royalty agreement with the claimant or develop alternative technology 
however  we may not be able to negotiate favorable license or royalty agreements  if any  in connection with such claims and we may fail to develop alternative technology on a timely basis 
accordingly  a successful product infringement claim against us could harm our business and operating results 
acquisitions of companies or technologies may result in disruptions to our business 
we may make strategic acquisitions of companies  products  or technologies as necessary in order to implement our business strategy 
if we make acquisitions and are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations  we may not receive the intended benefits of such acquisitions and the revenues and operating results of the combined company may decline 
any acquisition may temporarily disrupt our operations and divert management s attention from day to day operations 
in addition  acquisitions may subject us to unanticipated liabilities or risks  including litigation and the costs and uncertainties related to legal proceedings 
for example  we are currently a defendant in litigation related to our acquisition of engineeringperformance  inc  in november we are unable to predict an outcome for this litigation at this time 
as the alleged damages and related claims against the company are considerable  an unfavorable outcome would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flow 
while we have financed our acquisitions to date primarily through our working capital  we may incur debt or issue equity securities to finance future acquisitions 
the issuance of equity securities for any acquisition could be substantially dilutive to our stockholders 
in addition  our profitability may suffer due to acquisition related expenses 
we are susceptible to business interruptions that could harm our business 
our operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses  human errors  natural disasters  telecommunications failures  intentional acts of vandalism  and other similar events 
in particular  our corporate headquarters are located in san francisco  which is known for its seismic activities 
although we have a disaster recovery plan for critical data and business applications  this does not provide assurance that we would not suffer a business interruption 
a significant business interruption would result to losses or damages to our operation and harm our business 
our business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for losses that might occur  which would result in increased expenses and harm our operating results 
certain persons have substantial control over us  which could impede stockholder approval of certain transactions 
our executive officers and directors  in the aggregate  beneficially held of our outstanding common stock as of december  in addition  some of our founders who are no longer associated with us continue to hold a significant amount of our common stock 
these groups of stockholders  if acting together  can significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the approval of equity compensation plans  the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 

table of contents we expect the price of our common stock to remain volatile  making it difficult for our stockholders to predict the return on their investment 
since our initial public offering  the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in response to a number of factors  including market reactions to our announcement of the restatements of our financial statements for the years   and  the inability of the investing public to rely on our previously issued financial information for those years and the quarters ended march  june  and september  and  and the delayed filing of the form k for as disclosed in our form b filing dated march   market reaction to our announcement of the delayed filing of our form q for the quarter ended september   and the inability of the investing public to rely on our previously issued financial statements for the quarters ended march and june   changes in market valuation of software and technology companies  quarterly variations in our operating results  global and domestic economic and political conditions  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  announcements that we or our competitors make related to significant contracts  acquisitions  capital commitments  strategic partnerships or product introductions or enhancements  additions or departures of key personnel  stock market price and volume fluctuations  which are particularly volatile among securities of software and internet companies  and sales of significant amounts of our common stock or other securities in the open market 
some of our founders  who are no longer associated with the company  continue to hold significant amounts of our common stock 
we cannot control the sales of our common stock by these founders and that may add to the volatility of our stock price 
provisions of our charter and bylaws and delaware law could deter takeover attempts that might be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
we are subject to the provisions of delaware law that restrict business combinations with interested stockholders  which may have the effect of inhibiting a non negotiated merger or other business combinations 
an unfavorable government review of our tax returns or changes in our effective tax rates could adversely affect our operating results 
our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions 
our tax filings are subject to review or audit by the internal revenue service and state  local and foreign taxing authorities 
we exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and  in the ordinary course of our business  there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily relates to our investment portfolio  which at december  included fixed income securities with a fair value of approximately million 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
from time to time  some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with an interest rate fixed at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  marketable securities in money market funds  tax exempt municipal auction rate securities and tax exempt municipal bonds 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio 
based on our portfolio at december   if interest rates were to change by  interest income could be impacted positively or negatively by approximately  on an annualized basis 
there would be no material impact on the fair market value of the portfolio 
as of december   all of our investments were in money market accounts  tax exempt municipal auction rate securities and tax exempt municipal bonds 
foreign exchange risk our operations are conducted primarily in the united states and are denominated in united states dollars 
a small but growing portion of our sales originate through our european subsidiary and are denominated in pounds sterling 
with respect to such sales  revenues are collected and operating expenses are generally paid in pounds sterling 
accordingly  we are exposed to volatility in sales and earnings within europe due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
our exposure to foreign exchange risk is related to the magnitude of foreign net profits and losses denominated in pound sterling  as well as our net position of monetary assets and monetary liabilities in pound sterling 
these exposures have the potential to produce either gains or losses within our consolidated results 
in addition  our european operations in some instances act as a natural hedge because both operating expenses and sales are denominated in local currency 
in these instances  although an unfavorable change in the exchange rate of pound sterling against the us dollar will result in lower sales when translated to us dollars  operating expenses will also be lower 
we believe an immediate increase of in the exchange rates of the us dollar to pound sterling may have a material impact on our operating results or cash flows 
for example  in the pound sterling exchange rate strengthened by approximately over  which improved earnings per share by approximately 
our international business is subject to risks  including  but not limited to changing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility when compared to the united states 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors
