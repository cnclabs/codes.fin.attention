item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
forward looking statements the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  might  will  should  expect  plan  anticipate  project  believe  estimate  predict  potential  intend or continue  the negative of terms like these or other comparable terminology  and other words or terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance 
these statements are only predictions 
all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to us on the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
any or all of our forward looking statements in this document may turn out to be wrong 
actual events or results may differ materially 
our forward looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties 
in evaluating these statements  you should specifically consider various factors  including the risks outlined under the caption important factors that may affect our business  results of operations and stock price set forth at the end of this item and those contained from time to time in our other filings with the sec 
we caution investors that our business and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenues from the sale of products and services are recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fees are fixed and determinable and collectibility is assured 
revenues from multiple element arrangements involving upfront payments  license fees and milestone payments received for the delivery of rights or services representing the culmination of a separate earnings process are recognized when due and the amounts are considered collectible 
revenues from upfront payments  license fees and milestone payments received in connection with other rights or services which represent continuing obligations of ours are deferred until all of the elements have been delivered or we have verifiable and objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements 
upfront payments and license fees are recognized ratably over the collaboration research period 
payments for the achievement of substantive milestones are recognized when the milestone is achieved and payments for milestones which are not substantive are recognized ratably over the research period 
we perform certain research and development activities on behalf of collaborative partners 
we are generally reimbursed at pre determined billing rates and recognize revenue as the activities are performed  but bill the collaborator monthly  quarterly or upon the completion of the effort  based on the terms of each agreement 
amounts earned  but not billed to the collaborator  if any  are included in accounts receivable in the accompanying balance sheets 
investments 
our investments are diversified among high credit quality debt securities in accordance with our investment policy 
we classify our investments as available for sale  which are reported at fair market value with the related unrealized gains and losses included as a component of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses and declines in value of investments judged to be other than temporary are included in other income expense 
we have determined that unrealized losses are temporary as the duration of the decline in the value of the investments has been short  the extent of the decline  in both dollars and percentage of cost is not significant  and we have the ability and intent to hold the investments until we recover at least substantially all of the cost of the investment 
the fair value of our investments is subject to volatility 
to date  the carrying values of our investments have not been written down due to declines in value judged to be other than temporary 
declines in the fair value of our investments judged to be other than temporary could adversely affect our future operating results 

table of contents accrued expenses 
as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of services performed and the associated costs incurred for such services where we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost 
we make these estimates as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees paid to contract research organizations in conjunction with clinical trials  fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with manufacturing clinical grade materials  and professional service fees 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be provided and the level of effort in each period 
if the actual timing of the provision of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate  we will adjust the accrual accordingly 
in the event that we do not identify costs that have been incurred or we under or overestimated the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our actual expenses could differ from such estimates 
the date on which some services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often subjective determinations 
we make judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us at the time and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
research and development 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
research and development expenses consist of direct and overhead expenses for drug discovery and research  preclinical studies and for costs associated with clinical trial activities and are expensed as incurred 
costs to acquire technologies that are utilized in research and development and that have no alternative future use are expensed when incurred 
research and development expenses under government grants approximate the revenue recognized under such agreements 
reimbursements for shared expenses received from collaborative partners are recorded as reductions of research and development expenses 
we account for our clinical trial costs by estimating the total cost to treat a patient in each clinical trial and recognize this cost  based on a variety of factors  beginning with the preparation for the clinical trial 
this estimated cost includes payments to our contract research organizations for trial site and patient related costs  including laboratory costs related to the conduct of the trial  and other costs 
our cost per patient varies based on the type of clinical trial  the site of the clinical trial and the length of the treatment period for each patient 
as actual costs become known to us  we adjust our accrual  these changes in estimates may result in a change in our clinical study accrual  which could affect our results of operations 
stock based compensation 
we grant stock options to employees for a fixed number of shares with an exercise price equal to the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
we recognize no compensation expense on these employee stock option grants 
for certain stock options granted to nonemployees  we recognize as expense the estimated fair value of such options as calculated by the black scholes option pricing model  which is re measured during the service period 
fair value is determined using the black scholes option pricing model and the expense is amortized over the vesting period of each option or the recipient s contractual arrangement  if shorter 
changes in the fair value of our common stock during the service period will cause fluctuations in recognized compensation expense for variable options 
please refer to additional discussion on sfas no 
revised shares based payment  or sfas r  contained in this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under non cash stock based compensation 
income taxes 
we have net deferred tax assets which are fully offset by a valuation allowance due to our determination that net deferred assets will not be realized 
we believe that a full valuation allowance will be required on losses reported in future periods 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be made  a portion of which would increase income or decrease losses in the period in which such a determination was made 

table of contents on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  investments  accrued expenses  research and development  stock based compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
overview we focus on the development of monoclonal antibody based therapeutic products for the treatment of cancer and immunologic diseases 
we currently have three product candidates in clinical trials  sgn  sgn and sgn  and four product candidates in preclinical development sgn  sgn  sgn and sgn our pipeline of product candidates is based upon three technologies genetically engineered monoclonal antibodies  monoclonal antibody drug conjugates adcs and antibody directed enzyme prodrug therapy adept 
these technologies enable us to develop monoclonal antibodies that can kill target cells on their own as well as increase the potency of monoclonal antibodies by enhancing their cell killing ability 
we also have active discovery programs to identify novel antigens and new monoclonal antibodies 
since our inception  we have incurred substantial losses and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
these losses and accumulated deficit have resulted from the significant costs incurred in the development of our monoclonal antibody based technologies  clinical trial costs  manufacturing expenses of preclinical and clinical grade materials  general and administrative costs and non cash stock based compensation expenses 
we expect that our losses will continue for the foreseeable future as we continue to expand our research  development  clinical trial activities and infrastructure in support of these activities 
we do not currently have any commercial products for sale 
to date  our revenues have been derived principally from our collaboration and license agreements and from small business innovative research sbir grants 
in the future  our revenues may consist of milestone payments  technology licensing fees and sponsored research fees under existing and future collaborative arrangements  royalties from collaborations with current and future strategic partners  grant revenues and commercial product sales 
because a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future will depend on entering into new collaboration and license agreements and achieving development and clinical milestones under existing collaboration and license agreements  our results of operations may vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful and you should not rely on them as indicative of our future performance 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues revenues in thousands annual percentage change funded research and material supply fees earned portion of technology access fees and milestones collaborations and license agreements government grants total total revenues increased to million in from and increased to million in from  due to higher collaboration and license revenues 

table of contents funded research and material supply fees increased to million in from and increased to million in from in  this revenue growth came from increased fees earned as part of the research programs of our new adc collaborations with bayer and curagen and continuation of our existing adc collaborations with ucb celltech  genentech  protein design labs and our adept collaboration with genencor 
in  this revenue growth came from increased research and material supply fees from our collaborations with ucb celltech  genentech  protein design labs and genencor 
the earned portion of technology access fees and milestones increased to million in from and increased to million in from this revenue growth is the result of new adc collaborations and the expansion of existing adc collaborations and consists primarily of upfront technology access fees that are being recognized ratably over the research period of each collaboration 
we expect that future revenues will vary from year to year and from quarter to quarter based on the timing and amounts of payments under our current license and collaboration agreements and our ability to enter into additional agreements and obtain additional government grants 
research and development research and development in thousands annual percentage change total research and development expenses  excluding non cash stock based compensation expenses  increased to million in from and increased to million in from the increase in was principally due to increases in costs of manufacturing clinical grade materials of approximately million  increases in external clinical trial costs of approximately million  increases in personnel expenses of approximately million and increases in lab supplies of approximately million 
the increase in was principally due to increases in personnel expenses of approximately million  reduced collaboration expense reimbursement of approximately  increases in depreciation and occupancy costs of approximately  and increases in recruiting and relocation costs for new personnel of approximately  in  these expenses were offset by decreases in external clinical trial costs of approximately  the number of research and development personnel increased to at december  from at december  and from at december  our research and development expenses can be divided into research  development and contract manufacturing and clinical programs 
we estimate the costs associated with these programs as follows research development in thousands annual percentage change research development and contract manufacturing clinical total research expenses include  among other things  personnel  occupancy and laboratory expenses associated with the discovery and identification of new antigen targets and monoclonal antibodies and the development of novel classes of stable linkers and potent cell killing drugs 
research expenses increased primarily due to increased personnel expenses associated with higher staffing levels  which included the addition of our vice president  preclinical therapeutics  and related increases in general lab supplies 
development and contract manufacturing expenses include personnel and occupancy expenses and external contract manufacturing costs for the scale up and manufacturing of drug product for use in our clinical trials 

table of contents development costs increased in from due to both increased personnel expenses associated with higher staffing levels and increased contract manufacturing costs 
contract manufacturing costs increased by approximately million primarily due to our agreement with abbott laboratories for the manufacturing of our sgn monoclonal antibody product candidate  which is substantially complete 
this antibody is also used in our sgn adc product candidate 
both research and development expenses include additional costs related to our expanded laboratory and office facilities 
clinical expenses include personnel and occupancy expenses and external clinical trials costs including principal investigator fees  clinical site expenses  clinical research organization charges and regulatory activities associated with conducting human clinical trials 
clinical costs increased in from principally due to expanded third party costs for our sgn phase ii trials  new patient enrollments in our sgn phase i trials and costs for our sgn phase ii trials 
clinical costs also increased in from due to increased personnel expenses associated with higher staffing levels  which included two medical director positions 
costs associated with our clinical activities decreased in from due to the completion of patient enrollment in our sgn phase i trials and our sgn non small cell lung phase ii trial 
we allocate our employee and infrastructure resources across several projects  including our discovery and research programs directed towards identifying novel antigen targets  monoclonal antibodies and new classes of stable linkers and cell killing drugs 
many of our costs are not attributable to a specifically identified project  but instead are directed to overall research efforts 
accordingly  we do not allocate our infrastructure costs and do not account for internal research and development costs on a project by project basis 
as a result  we cannot report actual total costs incurred for each of our clinical and preclinical projects on a project by project basis 
we do  however  separately account for significant third party costs of development programs identified as product candidates for further preclinical and clinical development 
the following table shows  for the periods presented  total payments that we made or expenses incurred for preclinical study support  clinical supplies and clinical trial services provided by third parties for each of our product candidates and the remaining unallocated costs for such periods product candidates s in thousands annual percentage change years january  to december  sgn sgn sgn sgn sgn and sgn total third party costs unallocated costs and overhead total research and development sgn represents a majority of our total third party research and development expenditures due to the costs of manufacturing sgn for clinical trials and the costs of expanding our clinical trials into europe 
for sgn  genentech manufactured substantial quantities of clinical grade material that have been transferred to us  which has enabled us to keep our third party costs associated with sgn low during the initiation of our clinical development of sgn however  we expect the third party costs associated with sgn to increase as we expand our clinical trial activities and conduct later stage clinical and commercial manufacturing with abbott laboratories 
we also expect third party costs for sgn to increase as we conduct clinical grade manufacturing and initiate clinical trials 
our expenditures on current and future preclinical and clinical development programs are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion 
in order to advance our product candidates toward eventual commercialization  the product candidates are tested in 
table of contents numerous preclinical safety  toxicology and efficacy studies 
we then conduct clinical trials for those product candidates that may take several years or more to complete 
the length of time varies substantially based upon the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product candidate 
the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of a variety of factors  including the number of patients who participate in the trials  the length of time required to enroll trial participants  the number of sites included in the trials  the costs of producing supplies of the product candidates needed for clinical trials and regulatory submissions  the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate  and the costs and timing of  and the ability to secure  regulatory approvals 
furthermore  our strategy may include entering into collaborations with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of some of our product candidates 
in these situations  the preclinical development or clinical trial process for a product candidate and the estimated completion date may largely be under the control of that third party and not under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our product candidates will be subject to future collaborations or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements 
the risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in the section of this report titled important factors that may affect our business  results of operations and stock price 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects  anticipated completion dates or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product candidate 
we anticipate that our research  development  contract manufacturing and clinical expenses will continue to grow in the foreseeable future as we expand our discovery and preclinical activities  as new product candidates enter clinical trials and as we advance our product candidates already in clinical trials  sgn  sgn and sgn  to new clinical sites 
these expenses will fluctuate based upon many factors including the degree of collaborative activities  timing of manufacturing campaigns  numbers of patients enrolled in our clinical trials and the outcome of each clinical trial event 
general and administrative general and administrative in thousands annual percentage change total general and administrative expenses  excluding non cash stock based compensation expenses  increased to million in from and increased to million in from in  the increase was attributable to additional administrative personnel and increased professional service fees to facilitate compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of in  the increase was principally due to additional administrative personnel  benefit and severance pay costs and increased expenses for liability and directors and officers insurance 
the number of general and administrative personnel increased to at december  from at december  and from at december  we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as our costs related to adding personnel in support of our operations increase 
we will also continue to incur professional fees in order to comply with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of  but at anticipated levels below costs 

table of contents non cash stock based compensation non cash stock based compensation in thousands annual percentage change total non cash stock based compensation expense decreased to  in from and decreased to million in from these decreases are primarily attributable to scheduled accelerated amortization of deferred stock based compensation in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
over the vesting period of stock option grants issued prior to march  in  the decrease also includes changes for unvested stock option forfeitures from terminated employees  changes in value of options subject to variable accounting and a non cash stock based compensation charge of approximately  for accelerated vesting of stock options for employee severance pay 
variable accounting treatment related to non employee stock option grants results in charges or benefits  recorded to non cash stock based compensation  depending on fluctuations in the market value of our common stock 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised share based payment  or sfas r 
among other items  sfas r eliminates the use of apb and the intrinsic value method of accounting  and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards  in the financial statements 
sfas r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective method  or a modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after that date  and based on the requirements of sfas for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas r 
under the modified retrospective method  the requirements are the same as under the modified prospective method  but also permits entities to restate financial statements of previous periods based on proforma disclosures made in accordance with sfas we currently utilize a standard option pricing model ie  black scholes to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
while sfas r permits entities to continue to use such a model  the standard also permits the use of a lattice model 
we have not yet determined which model we will use to measure the fair value of employee stock options upon the adoption of sfas r 
we currently expect to adopt sfas r effective july  if we adopt the modified prospective method and continue to use the standard option pricing model  we estimate share based compensation expense to be approximately million for the quarter ended september  and approximately  for the quarter ended december  based on stock options outstanding as of february  these estimates may increase as additional awards of equity instruments are granted 
we currently do not anticipate any changes in compensation strategies due to the adoption of fas r 
investment income  net investment income  net in thousands annual percentage change total investment income increased to million in from and decreased to million in from in  the increase was primarily due to additional interest income received from the net proceeds of approximately million from our follow on public offering of  shares of common stock that was completed in february in  the decrease was primarily due to declining average interest yields 
we anticipate that investment income will decline in based on lower average anticipated levels of cash and investment balances 

table of contents non cash accretion of preferred stock deemed dividend non cash accretion of preferred stock deemed dividend in thousands total non cash accretion of preferred stock deemed dividend was million in and  in as part of our series a convertible preferred stock financing in july  we recorded a non cash accretion of preferred stock deemed dividend  which represented an increase to reported net loss in arriving at net loss attributable to common stockholders  using the effective interest method through the date of earliest conversion in july in the future  we will not record any additional non cash accretion of preferred stock deemed dividend as part of our series a convertible preferred stock financing 
the non cash accretion of the preferred stock deemed dividend did not have an effect on net loss or cash flows for the applicable reporting periods or have an impact on total stockholders equity as of the applicable reporting dates 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources at december cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments working capital for the year ended december cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities capital expenditures included in investing activities above we have financed our operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities and funding from our collaboration and license agreements 
for the previous three years  we received million in net proceeds from our follow on public offering  approximately million of net proceeds from our private placement of series a convertible preferred stock and common stock warrants  approximately million in cash fees and milestone payments under our collaboration and license agreements  approximately million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock to our collaborators pursuant to our collaboration and license agreements and approximately million in cash from stock option exercises and from common stock issued pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan 
at december   cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments totaled million 
our cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments and restricted investments are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments  consisting of us government and agency securities  high grade us corporate bonds  taxable municipal bonds  mortgage backed securities  commercial paper and money market accounts 
capital expenditures of million in consisted of improvements  lab equipment  furniture and fixtures  primarily in connection with the expansion of our existing headquarters and operations facility for lab and office expansion which was completed during august capital expenditures of  in and million in consisted primarily of lab equipment  computers and related information systems in support of our research and development activities and in support of employee growth 
we expect that our capital expenditures will decrease from based on completion of improvements to our existing headquarters and operations facility during we expect to incur substantial costs as we continue to develop and commercialize our product candidates 
we anticipate that our rate of spending will accelerate as a result of the increased costs and expenses associated 
table of contents with adding personnel  clinical trials  regulatory filings  manufacturing  and research and development collaborations 
however  we may experience fluctuations in incurring these costs from quarter to quarter based on the timing of manufacturing campaigns  accrual of patients to clinical trials and collaborative activities 
certain external factors may influence our cash spending including factors such as the progress of our research and development activities  the cost of filing and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments and our ability to establish collaboration and license agreements 
some of our manufacturing  license and collaboration agreements also provide for periodic maintenance fees over specified time periods  as well as payments by us upon the achievement of development and regulatory milestones and the payment of royalties based on commercial product sales 
we do not expect to pay any royalties on net sales of products under any of these agreements for at least the next several years 
the amounts set forth above could be substantially higher if we are required to make milestone payments or if we receive regulatory approvals and are required to pay royalties earlier than anticipated 
the following are our future minimum contractual commitments for the periods subsequent to december  in thousands total thereafter operating leases manufacturing  license and collaboration agreements total the minimum payments under manufacturing  license and collaboration agreements in primarily represent contractual obligations related to manufacturing campaigns to perform scale up and gmp manufacturing for monoclonal antibody and adc products for use in our clinical trials 
as part of the terms of our office and laboratory lease  we have collateralized certain obligations under the lease with approximately  of our investments and the majority of our property and equipment 
these investment securities are restricted as to withdrawal and are managed by a third party 
beginning in june  the lease provides for decreases in the restricted account balance by approximately  per year provided that the total amount pledged does not fall below approximately  in the event that we fail to meet specific thresholds of market capitalization  stockholders equity or cash and investment balances  we would be obligated to increase our restricted investment balance 
at december   we were in compliance with these thresholds 
we believe that our current cash and investment balances will be sufficient to enable us to meet our anticipated expenditures and operating requirements for at least the next months 
however  changes in our business may occur that would consume available capital resources sooner than we expect 
we may seek additional funding through some or all of the following methods corporate collaborations  licensing arrangements and public or private equity financings 
we do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed  or that  if available  we will obtain financing on terms favorable to our stockholders or us 
if we are unable to raise additional funds should we need them  we may be required to delay  reduce or eliminate some of our development programs  which may adversely affect our business and operations 
subsequent events in february  curagen corporation paid a million fee to exercise its option to designate a second antigen target under its existing adc collaboration with us 
under the terms of the agreement  curagen has rights to use our adc technology with antibodies against up to two targets selected by curagen 
curagen also pays ongoing technology access and material supply fees and has agreed to make progress dependent milestone 
table of contents payments and pay royalties on net sales of adc products 
curagen is responsible for research  product development  manufacturing and commercialization of any products resulting from the collaboration 
in february  we entered into an agreement with abbott laboratories for manufacturing of our sgn monoclonal antibody product candidate 
under the terms of the agreement  abbott has agreed to perform scale up and gmp manufacturing of sgn to support clinical trials 
in the future  abbott has also agreed to manufacture commercial grade material to support potential regulatory approval and commercial launch of sgn if required 
our total costs through the end of of manufacturing sgn with abbott could be up to million 
in march  we achieved a milestone under our adc collaboration agreement with genentech  triggering a payment to us 
the milestone is based on genentech s continued progress in preclinical development with an adc utilizing our technology 
important factors that may affect our business  results of operations and stock price you should carefully consider the risks described below  together with all of the other information included in this annual report on form k and the information incorporated by reference herein 
if we do not effectively address the risks we face  our business will suffer and we may never achieve or sustain profitability 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this annual report on form k also contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of factors that are described below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our product candidates are at early stages of development and  if we are not able to successfully develop and commercialize them  we may not generate sufficient revenues to continue our business operations 
all of our product candidates are in early stages of development 
significant further research and development  financial resources and personnel will be required to develop commercially viable products and obtain regulatory approvals 
currently  sgn  sgn and sgn are in clinical trials and sgn  sgn  sgn and sgn are in preclinical development 
we expect that much of our efforts and expenditures over the next few years will be devoted to these clinical and preclinical product candidates 
we have no products that have received regulatory approval for commercial sale 
our ability to commercialize our product candidates depends on first receiving fda approval 
thereafter  the commercial success of these product candidates will depend upon their acceptance by physicians  patients  third party payors and other key decision makers as therapeutic and cost effective alternatives to currently available products 
if we fail to gain approval from the fda or to produce a commercially successful product  we may not be able to earn sufficient revenues to continue as a going concern 
we will continue to need significant amounts of additional capital that may not be available to us 
we expect to make additional capital outlays and to increase operating expenditures over the next several years as we hire additional employees and support our preclinical development  manufacturing and clinical trial activities 
we will need to seek additional funding through public or private financings  including equity financings  and through other means  including collaborations and license agreements 
however  changes in our business may occur that would consume available capital resources sooner than we expect 
if adequate funds are not available to us  we will be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our development programs 
we do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed  or that  if available  we will obtain financing on terms favorable to our stockholders or us 
our future capital requirements will depend upon a number of factors  including the size  complexity and timing of our clinical programs  our receipt of milestone based payments or other revenue from our collaborations or license arrangements  
table of contents the ability to manufacture sufficient drug supply to complete clinical trials  progress with clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs associated with acquisitions or licenses of additional products  including licenses we may need to commercialize our products  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  and product commercialization activities 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience substantial dilution 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies or product candidates  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
clinical trials for our product candidates are expensive  time consuming and their outcome is uncertain 
before we can obtain regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any product candidate that we wish to develop  we are required to complete preclinical development and extensive clinical trials in humans to demonstrate its safety and efficacy 
each of these trials requires the investment of substantial expense and time 
we are currently conducting phase ii clinical trials of our two most advanced product candidates and phase i clinical trials of a third product candidate 
we expect to commence additional trials of these and other product candidates in the future 
there are numerous factors that could delay each of these clinical trials or prevent us from completing these trials successfully 
commercialization of our product candidates will ultimately depend upon successful completion of additional research and development and testing in both clinical trials and preclinical models 
at the present time  sgn  sgn and sgn are our only product candidates in clinical development and sgn  sgn  sgn and sgn are our only product candidates in preclinical development 
as a result  any delays or difficulties we encounter with these product candidates may impact our ability to generate revenue and cause our stock price to decline significantly 
ongoing and future clinical trials of our product candidates may not show sufficient safety or efficacy to obtain requisite regulatory approvals 
we still only have limited efficacy data from our phase i and phase ii clinical trials of sgn and sgn and our phase i clinical trials of sgn phase i and phase ii clinical trials are not primarily designed to test the efficacy of a drug candidate but rather to test safety  to study pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and to understand the drug candidate s side effects at various doses and schedules 
for example  we are currently conducting two phase ii biomarker studies of sgn in an effort to optimize the dosing schedules of sgn in combination with taxotere 
furthermore  success in preclinical and early clinical trials does not ensure that later large scale trials will be successful nor does it predict final results 
acceptable results in early trials may not be repeated in later trials 
we believe that any clinical trial designed to test the efficacy of sgn  sgn or sgn  whether phase ii or phase iii  will likely involve a large number of patients to achieve statistical significance and will be expensive 
we may conduct lengthy and expensive clinical trials of sgn  sgn or sgn  only to learn that the drug candidate is not an effective treatment 
a number of companies in the biotechnology industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after promising results in earlier trials 
in addition  clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay  limit or prevent regulatory approvals 
negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could cause it to be redone or terminated 
in addition  failure to construct appropriate clinical trial protocols could result in the test or control group experiencing a disproportionate number of adverse events and could cause a clinical trial to be redone or terminated 
the length of time necessary to complete clinical trials and to submit an application for marketing approval for a final decision by the fda or another regulatory authority may also vary significantly based on the type  complexity and novelty of the product involved  as well as other factors 

table of contents our clinical trials may take longer to complete than we project or they may not be completed at all 
the timing of the commencement  continuation and completion of clinical trials may be subject to significant delays relating to various causes  including scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions  difficulties in identifying and enrolling patients who meet trial eligibility criteria  and shortages of available drug supply 
patient enrollment is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  the eligibility criteria for the trial  the existence of competing clinical trials and the availability of alternative or new treatments 
we depend on medical institutions to conduct our clinical trials and to the extent they fail to enroll patients for our clinical trials or are delayed for a significant time in achieving full enrollment  we may be affected by increased costs  program delays or both  which may harm our business 
in addition  we may conduct clinical trials in foreign countries in the future which may subject us to further delays and expenses as a result of increased drug shipment costs  additional regulatory requirements and the engagement of foreign clinical research organizations  as well as expose us to risks associated with foreign currency transactions insofar as we might desire to use us dollars to make contract payments denominated in the foreign currency where the trial is being conducted 
clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the fda s or other applicable foreign government guidelines and are subject to oversight by the fda  other foreign governmental agencies and institutional review boards at the medical institutions where the clinical trials are conducted 
in addition  clinical trials must be conducted with supplies of our product candidates produced under the fda s current good manufacturing practices and other requirements in foreign countries  and may require large numbers of test patients 
we  the fda or other foreign governmental agencies might delay or halt our clinical trials of a product candidate for various reasons  including deficiencies in the conduct of the clinical trials  the product candidate may have unforeseen adverse side effects  the time required to determine whether the product candidate is effective may be longer than expected  fatalities or other adverse events arising during a clinical trial due to medical problems that may not be related to clinical trial treatments  the product candidate may not appear to be more effective than current therapies  quality or stability of the product candidate may fall below acceptable standards  or we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of the product candidate to complete the trials 
due to these and other factors  our current product candidates or any of our other future product candidates could take a significantly longer time to gain regulatory approval than we expect or may never gain approval  which could reduce or eliminate our revenue by delaying or terminating the potential commercialization of our product candidates 
we currently rely on third party manufacturers and other third parties for production of our drug products and our dependence on these manufacturers may impair the development of our product candidates 
we do not currently have the ability to manufacture ourselves the drug products that we need to conduct our clinical trials and rely upon a limited number of manufacturers to supply our drug products 
we received clinical grade sgn from bristol myers squibb for our previous clinical trials  and have entered into agreements with contract manufacturers including icos corporation  albany molecular research and sicor inc  now a wholly owned subsidiary of teva pharmaceutical industries ltd  to supplement our supplies of sgn as necessary for future studies 
for sgn  we have contracted with icos to manufacture preclinical and early stage clinical supplies and with abbott laboratories for late stage clinical and commercial supplies 
for sgn  genentech manufactured substantial quantities of clinical grade material that have been transferred to us  and we have contracted with abbott laboratories for late stage clinical and commercial supplies 
in addition  we rely on other third parties to perform additional steps in the manufacturing process  including synthesis of our next generation drug linker systems  conjugation  vialing and storage of our product candidates 

table of contents for the foreseeable future  we expect to continue to rely on contract manufacturers and other third parties to produce  vial and store sufficient quantities of our product candidates for use in our clinical trials 
if our contract manufacturers or other third parties fail to deliver our product candidates for clinical use on a timely basis  with sufficient quality  and at commercially reasonable prices  and we fail to find replacement manufacturers or to develop our own manufacturing capabilities  we may be required to delay or suspend clinical trials or otherwise discontinue development and production of our product candidates 
in addition  we depend on outside vendors for the supply of raw materials used to produce our product candidates 
if the third party suppliers were to cease production or otherwise fail to supply us with quality raw materials and we were unable to contract on acceptable terms for these raw materials with alternative suppliers  our ability to have our product candidates manufactured and to conduct preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates would be adversely affected 
securing phase iii and commercial quantities of our product candidates from contract manufacturers will require us to commit significant capital and resources 
we may also be required to enter into long term manufacturing agreements that contain exclusivity provisions and or substantial termination penalties 
in addition  contract manufacturers have a limited number of facilities in which our product candidates can be produced and any interruption of the operation of those facilities due to events such as equipment malfunction or failure or damage to the facility by natural disasters could result in the cancellation of shipments  loss of product in the manufacturing process or a shortfall in available product candidates 
our contract manufacturers are required to produce our clinical product candidates under fda current good manufacturing practices in order to meet acceptable standards for our clinical trials 
if such standards change  the ability of contract manufacturers to produce our product candidates on the schedule we require for our clinical trials may be affected 
in addition  contract manufacturers may not perform their obligations under their agreements with us or may discontinue their business before the time required by us to successfully produce and market our product candidates 
any difficulties or delays in our contractors manufacturing and supply of product candidates could increase our costs  cause us to lose revenue or make us postpone or cancel clinical trials 
the fda requires that we demonstrate structural and functional comparability between the same drug product manufactured by different organizations 
because we have used or intend to use multiple sources to manufacture sgn  sgn and sgn  we will need to conduct comparability studies to assess whether manufacturing changes have affected the product safety  identity  purity or potency of any commercial drug candidate compared to the drug candidate used in clinical trials 
if we are unable to demonstrate comparability  the fda could require us to conduct additional clinical trials  which would be expensive and significantly delay any commercialization 
our second generation adc technology and our adept technology are still at an early stage of development and have not yet entered human clinical trials 
our second generation adc technology  utilizing proprietary stable linkers and highly potent cell killing drugs  and our adept technology are still at relatively early stages of development 
the adc technology is used in our sgn and sgn product candidates and is the basis of our collaborations with genentech  ucb celltech  protein design labs  curagen and bayer 
the adept technology is used in our sgn product candidate and is the basis of our collaboration with genencor 
we and our corporate collaborators are still conducting toxicology  pharmacology  pharmacokinetics and other preclinical studies  and significant additional studies will be required before any of these adc or adept product candidates enter human clinical trials 
for example  we have observed evidence of toxicity in some preclinical models with certain drug linker forms and are focusing our efforts on forms with the lowest toxicity in order to maximize the therapeutic window of our adc technology 
in addition  preclinical models to study anti cancer activity of compounds are not necessarily predictive of toxicity or efficacy of these compounds in the treatment of human cancer and there is no assurance that we will be able to use these technologies in the treatment of humans 
any failures or setbacks in our adc or adept programs could have a detrimental impact on our internal product candidate pipeline and our ability to maintain and or enter into new corporate collaborations regarding this technology  which would negatively affect our business and financial position 

table of contents we have a history of net losses 
we expect to continue to incur net losses and may not achieve or maintain profitability for some time  if at all 
our limited operating history may make it difficult to evaluate our business and an investment in our common stock 
we have incurred net losses in each of our years of operation and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to make substantial expenditures to further develop and commercialize our product candidates and anticipate that our rate of spending will accelerate as the result of the increased costs and expenses associated with research  development  clinical trials  manufacturing  regulatory approvals and commercialization of our potential products 
in the near term  we expect our revenues to be derived from technology licensing fees  sponsored research fees and milestone payments under existing and future collaborative arrangements and from government grants 
in the longer term  our revenues may also include royalties from collaborations with current and future strategic partners and commercial product sales 
however  our revenue and profit potential is unproven and our limited operating history makes our future operating results difficult to predict 
in some circumstances we rely on collaborators to assist in the research and development activities necessary for the commercialization of our product candidates 
if we are not able to locate suitable collaborators or if our collaborators do not perform as expected  we may not be able to commercialize our product candidates 
we have established and intend to continue to establish alliances with third party collaborators to develop and market some of our current and future product candidates and to license our adc and adept technologies 
we have licensed our adc technology to genentech  ucb celltech  protein design labs  curagen and bayer  and have licensed our adept technology to genencor 
these collaborations provide us with cash and revenues through technology access and license fees  sponsored research fees  equity sales and potential milestone and royalty payments 
we use these funds to partially fund the development costs of our internal pipeline of product candidates 
collaborations can also create and strengthen our relationships with leading biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and may provide synergistic benefits by combining our technologies with the technologies of our collaborators 
for example  in july  we formed a collaboration with celera genomics to jointly discover and develop antibody based therapies for cancer 
under certain conditions  our collaborators may terminate their agreements with us and discontinue use of our technologies 
we cannot control the amount and timing of resources our collaborators may devote to products incorporating our technology 
additionally  our relationships with our collaborators divert significant time and effort of our scientific staff and management team and require effective allocation of our resources to multiple internal and collaborative projects 
our collaborators may separately pursue competing products  therapeutic approaches or technologies to develop treatments for the diseases targeted by us or our collaborators 
even if our collaborators continue their contributions to the collaborative arrangements  they may nevertheless determine not to actively pursue the development or commercialization of any resulting products 
our collaborators may fail to perform their obligations under the collaboration agreements or may be slow in performing their obligations 
if any of our collaborators terminate or breach our agreements with them  or otherwise fail to complete their obligations in a timely manner  it may have a detrimental effect on our financial position by reducing or eliminating the potential for us to receive technology access and license fees  milestones and royalties  as well as possibly requiring us to devote additional efforts and incur costs associated with pursuing internal development of product candidates 
furthermore  if our collaborators do not prioritize and commit substantial resources to programs associated with our product candidates  we may be unable to commercialize our product candidates  which would limit our ability to generate revenue and become profitable 
in the future  we may not be able to locate third party collaborators to develop and market our product candidates and we may lack the capital and resources necessary to develop all our product candidates alone 
we depend on a small number of collaborators for most of our current revenue 
the loss of any one of these collaborators could result in a substantial decline in our revenue 
we have collaborations with a limited number of companies 
to date  almost all of our revenue has resulted from payments made under agreements with our corporate collaborators  and we expect that most of our future 
table of contents revenue will continue to come from corporate collaborations until the approval and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates 
the failure of our collaborators to perform their obligations under their agreements with us  including paying license or technology fees  milestone payments or royalties  could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 
in addition  a significant portion of revenue received from our corporate collaborators is derived from research and material supply fees  and a decision by any of our corporate collaborators to conduct more research and development activities themselves could significantly reduce the revenue received from these collaborations 
payments under our existing and future collaboration agreements are also subject to significant fluctuations in both timing and amount  which could cause our revenue to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors and cause a decrease in our stock price 
we rely on license agreements for certain aspects of our product candidates and technology 
failure to maintain these license agreements or to secure any required new licenses could prevent us from developing or commercializing our product candidates and technology 
we have entered into agreements with third party commercial and academic institutions to license technology for use in our adc technology and product candidates 
currently  we have license agreements with bristol myers squibb  arizona state university  genentech  protein design labs  clb research and development  icos corporation  mabtech ab  the university of miami and imperial college london  among others 
some of these license agreements contain diligence and milestone based termination provisions  in which case our failure to meet any agreed upon diligence requirements or milestones may allow the licensor to terminate the agreement 
many of our license agreements grant us exclusive licenses to the underlying technologies 
if our licensors terminate our license agreements or if we are unable to maintain the exclusivity of our exclusive license agreements  we may be unable to continue to develop and commercialize our product candidates 
in addition  continued development and commercialization of our product candidates may require us to secure licenses to additional technologies 
we may not be able to secure these licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
we rely on third parties to provide services in connection with our preclinical and clinical development programs 
the inadequate performance by or loss of any of these service providers could affect our product candidate development 
several third parties provide services in connection with our preclinical and clinical development programs  including in vitro and in vivo studies  assay and reagent development  immunohistochemistry  toxicology  pharmacokinetics and other outsourced activities 
if these service providers do not adequately perform the services for which we have contracted or cease to continue operations and we are not able to quickly find a replacement provider or we lose information or items associated with our product candidates  our development programs may be delayed 
if we are unable to enforce our intellectual property rights  we may not be able to operate our business profitably 
similarly  if we fail to sustain and further build our intellectual property rights  competitors may be able to develop competing therapies 
our success depends  in part  on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and successfully defending these patents against third party challenges in the united states  canada  france  germany  japan  united kingdom and italy  as well as other countries 
we own multiple us and foreign patents and pending patent applications for our technologies 
we also have rights to issued us patents  patent applications  and their foreign counterparts  relating to our monoclonal antibody and drug based technologies 
our rights to these patents and patent applications are derived from worldwide licenses from bristol myers squibb  arizona state university  genentech and protein design labs  among others 
in addition  we have licensed our us and foreign patents and patent applications to third parties 
the standards that the us patent and trademark office and foreign patent offices use to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change 
consequently  our pending patent applications may not be allowed and  if allowed  may not contain the type and extent of patent claims that will be adequate to 
table of contents conduct our business as planned 
additionally  any issued patents may not contain claims that will permit us to stop competitors from using similar technology 
similarly  the standards that courts use to interpret patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and may evolve  particularly as new technologies develop 
as a result  the protection  if any  given by our patents if we attempt to enforce them or if they are challenged in court is uncertain 
we rely on trade secrets and other proprietary information where we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable 
however  trade secrets and other proprietary information are difficult to protect 
we have taken measures to protect our unpatented trade secrets and know how  including the use of confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements with our employees  consultants and certain contractors 
it is possible  however  that these persons may breach the agreements or that our competitors may independently develop or otherwise discover our trade secrets or other proprietary information 
our research collaborators may publish data and information to which we have rights 
if we cannot maintain the confidentiality of our technology and other confidential information in connection with our collaborations  then our ability to receive patent protection or protect our proprietary information may be impaired 
we may incur substantial costs and lose important rights as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property rights  us patent and trademark office interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings in the united states and elsewhere involve complex legal and factual questions 
these proceedings are costly and time consuming 
if we become involved in any litigation  interference or other administrative proceedings  we will incur substantial expense and it will divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
an adverse determination may subject us to significant liabilities or require us to seek licenses that may not be available from third parties on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
we may be restricted or prevented from developing and commercializing our product candidates in the event of an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding  or if we fail to obtain necessary licenses 
if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified personnel  our future growth and ability to compete would suffer 
we are highly dependent on the efforts and abilities of the principal members of our senior management 
additionally  we have several scientific personnel with significant and unique expertise in monoclonal antibodies and related technologies 
the loss of the services of any one of the principal members of our managerial or scientific staff may prevent us from achieving our business objectives 
the competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology field is intense  and our future success depends upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled scientific  technical and managerial employees 
in order to commercialize our products successfully  we will be required to expand our workforce  particularly in the areas of manufacturing  clinical trials management  regulatory affairs  business development and sales and marketing 
these activities will require the addition of new personnel  including management  and the development of additional expertise by existing management personnel 
we face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  as well as academic and other research institutions 
to the extent we are not able to attract and retain these individuals on favorable terms  our business may be harmed 
we face intense competition and rapid technological change  which may result in others discovering  developing or commercializing competing products before or more successfully than we do 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and subject to significant and rapid technological change 
we are aware of many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are actively engaged in research and development in areas related to antibody therapy 
some of these competitors have 
table of contents successfully commercialized antibody products or are developing or testing product candidates that do or may in the future compete directly with our product candidates 
for example  we believe that companies including genentech  amgen  immunogen  biogen idec  medarex  chiron and wyeth are developing and or marketing products that may compete with ours 
other potential competitors include large  fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and more established biotechnology companies  which have significant resources and expertise in research and development  manufacturing  testing  obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing 
also  academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private research organizations conduct research  seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research  development  manufacturing and marketing 
it is possible that these competitors will succeed in developing technologies that are more effective than our product candidates or that would render our technology obsolete or noncompetitive 
if our competitors develop superior products  manufacturing capability or marketing expertise  our business may fail 
our business may fail because we face intense competition from major pharmaceutical companies and specialized biotechnology companies engaged in the development of other products directed at cancer 
many of our competitors have greater financial and human resources expertise and more experience in the commercialization of product candidates 
our competitors may  among other things develop safer or more effective products  implement more effective approaches to sales and marketing  develop less costly products  obtain quicker regulatory approval  have access to more manufacturing capacity  form more advantageous strategic alliances  or establish superior proprietary positions 
in addition  if we receive regulatory approvals  we may compete with well established  fda approved therapies that have generated substantial sales over a number of years 
we anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter our market and scientific developments surrounding other cancer therapies continue to accelerate 
we have no experience in commercializing products on our own and  to the extent we do not develop this ability or contract with a third party to assist us  we may not be able to successfully sell our product candidates 
we do not have a sales and marketing force and may not be able to develop this capacity 
if we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities  we will need to enter into sales and marketing agreements to market our products in the united states 
for sales outside the united states  we plan to enter into third party arrangements 
in these foreign markets  if we are unable to establish successful distribution relationships with pharmaceutical companies  we may fail to realize the full sales potential of our product candidates 
additionally  our product candidates may not gain market acceptance among physicians  patients  healthcare payors and the medical community 
the degree of market acceptance of any approved product candidate will depend on a number of factors  including establishment and demonstration of clinical efficacy and safety  cost effectiveness of a product  its potential advantage over alternative treatment methods  and marketing and distribution support for the product 
moreover  government health administrative authorities  private health insurers and other organizations are increasingly challenging both the need for and the price of new medical products and services 
consequently  uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics and diagnostics 
for these and 
table of contents other reasons  physicians  patients  third party payors and the medical community may not accept and utilize any product candidates that we develop and even if they do  reimbursement may not be available for our products to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development 
similarly  even if we do receive reimbursement  the target market for our products may be small or the focus of intense competition and we may not realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development 
the holders of our series a convertible preferred stock have voting and other rights that they could exercise against your best interests 
the holders of our series a convertible preferred stock have rights to designate two members of our board of directors and to vote as a separate class on certain significant corporate transactions  including the issuance of securities that would rank on a par with or senior to the series a convertible preferred stock or the incurrence of debt in excess of million 
the holders of series a convertible preferred stock are not entitled to receive any cumulative or non cumulative dividends  and may only receive a dividend when and as declared by our board of directors or if any dividends are paid on any other shares of our capital stock based on the number of shares of common stock into which such holder s shares of series a convertible preferred stock would then convert 
in addition  upon our liquidation or dissolution including a merger or acquisition  the holders of our series a convertible preferred stock are entitled to receive a liquidation preference in an amount equal to the greater of per share of series a convertible preferred stock or the amount that would have been paid had each such share of series a convertible preferred stock been converted to common stock 
the holders of series a convertible preferred stock also have the right under certain circumstances in the event of our merger or acquisition approved by our board of directors to receive their liquidation preference in cash or a combination of cash and new preferred securities of the acquiring or surviving corporation 
this requirement to pay cash or issue new preferred securities does not apply if the consideration to be received by the series a holders has an aggregate value of more than per share calculated on an as if converted to common stock basis determined on the date definitive documentation for such sale transaction is signed or if holders of rds of the outstanding shares of series a convertible preferred stock waive this requirement 
the holders of series a convertible preferred stock may exercise these rights to the detriment of our common stockholders 
the holders of our series a convertible preferred stock also have the right at any time to request that we register for resale the shares of our common stock that they acquire upon conversion of their series a convertible preferred stock or upon exercise of their warrants to purchase our common stock  subject to certain limitations 
in addition  the holders of our series a convertible preferred stock may convert their series a convertible preferred stock into common stock at any time and sell shares of the common stock acquired upon such conversion in the public market in reliance upon rule future sales in the public market of such common stock  or the perception that such sales might occur  could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could make it more difficult for us to raise funds through a public offering or private placement of our equity securities 
we face product liability risks and may not be able to obtain adequate insurance to protect us against losses 
we currently have no products that have been approved for commercial sale 
however  the current and future use of our product candidates by us and our corporate collaborators in clinical trials  and the sale of any approved products in the future  may expose us to liability claims 
these claims might be made directly by consumers or healthcare providers or indirectly by pharmaceutical companies  our corporate collaborators or others selling such products 
we may experience financial losses in the future due to product liability claims 
we have obtained limited general commercial liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials 
we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates 
however  we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses 
if a successful product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liabilities  our assets may not be sufficient to cover such claims and our business operations could be impaired 

table of contents our operations involve hazardous materials and are subject to environmental  health and safety controls and regulations 
we are subject to environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  including those governing the use of hazardous materials 
the cost of compliance with environmental  health and safety regulations is substantial 
our business activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
in the event of an accident or environmental discharge  we may be held liable for any resulting damages  which may materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may engage in future acquisitions that increase our capital requirements  dilute our stockholders  cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities and subject us to other risks 
we actively evaluate various strategic transactions on an ongoing basis  including licensing or acquiring complementary products  technologies or businesses 
any potential acquisitions may entail numerous risks  including increased operating expenses and cash requirements  assimilation of operations and products  retention of key employees  diversion of our management s attention and uncertainties in our ability to maintain key business relationships of the acquired entities 
in addition  if we undertake acquisitions  we may issue dilutive securities  assume or incur debt obligations  incur large one time expenses and acquire intangible assets that could result in significant future amortization expense 
moreover  we may not be able to locate suitable acquisition opportunities and this inability could impair our ability to grow or obtain access to technology or products that may be important to the development of our business 
legislative actions  potential new accounting pronouncements and higher insurance costs are likely to impact our future financial position or results of operations 
future changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse  unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our financial position or results of operations 
new pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred with frequency in the past and may occur again in the future and as a result we may be required to make changes in our accounting policies 
compliance with new regulations regarding corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nasdaq national market rules and the recent accounting changes to expense stock options  are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours and insurance costs are increasing as a result of this uncertainty and other factors 
as a result  we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards  and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from science and business activities to compliance activities 
for example  we have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial costs and expend significant resources to comply with the regulations promulgated under section of the sarbanes oxley act of our stock price may be volatile and our shares may suffer a decline in value 
the market prices for securities of biotechnology companies have in the past been  and are likely to continue in the future to be  very volatile 
during the fourth quarter of  our stock price fluctuated between and per share 
as a result of fluctuations in the price of our common stock  you may be unable to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for them 
the market price of our common stock may be subject to substantial volatility in response to many risk factors listed in this section  and others beyond our control  including announcements regarding the results of discovery efforts and preclinical and clinical activities by us or our competitors  changes in our existing corporate partnerships or licensing arrangements  establishment of new corporate partnering or licensing arrangements by us or our competitors  our ability to raise capital  
table of contents developments or disputes concerning our proprietary rights  issuance of new or changed analysts reports and recommendations regarding us or our competitors  share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares  changes in government regulations  and economic or other external factors 
our existing stockholders have significant control of our management and affairs 
our executive officers and directors and holders of greater than five percent of our outstanding voting stock  together with entities that may be deemed affiliates of  or related to  such persons or entities  beneficially owned approximately percent of our voting power as of march  as a result  these stockholders  acting together  may be able to control our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions  such as mergers  consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets 
consequently  this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control  including a merger  consolidation  takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control  which might affect the market price of our common stock 
anti takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
in addition to the  shares of series a convertible preferred stock that are currently outstanding as of march   our board of directors has the authority to issue up to an additional  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of seattle genetics without further action by the stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock 
further  certain provisions of our charter documents  including provisions eliminating the ability of stockholders to take action by written consent and limiting the ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of stockholders without giving advance notice  may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of seattle genetics  which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock 
in addition  our charter documents provide for a classified board  which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board of directors 
similarly  state anti takeover laws in delaware and washington related to corporate takeovers may prevent or delay a change of control of seattle genetics 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in accordance with our policy  we do not have any derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest in high quality interest bearing instruments  consisting of us government and agency securities  high grade us corporate bonds  taxable municipal bonds  adjustable mortgage backed securities  commercial paper and money market accounts 
such securities are subject to interest rate risk and will rise and fall in value if market interest rates change  however  we do not expect any material loss from such interest rate changes
