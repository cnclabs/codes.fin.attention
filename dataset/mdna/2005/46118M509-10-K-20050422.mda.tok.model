item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and under revenue recognition in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item below  and the arising of any contingencies that make deferral of revenue recognition appropriate under any given contract 
we also caution that total annual contract value is different from backlog 
backlog typically excludes amounts already recognized as revenue  while total annual contract value may include amounts already recognized as revenue for portions of the current annual terms of our existing subscribenet contracts 
in addition  total annual contract value includes fees paid  payable or expected for the current annual terms of our existing subscribenet contracts  even if we expect to provide the related services after our current fiscal year 
marketing our central marketing goals are to attract and retain customers for our services 
we target our marketing efforts to senior personnel across multiple departments in software companies and other mid sized and large corporations 
we use an integrated approach of targeted advertising  direct mail  email and online promotions  interactive web based seminars  or webinars  event sponsorships  trade shows  brand awareness campaigns  and regular meetings with existing customers to stimulate demand for our services  generate sales leads and maintain customer relationships 
we employ a variety of tools to achieve our marketing goals 
our print and online advertising campaigns are designed to target senior personnel across multiple departments in software companies  and educate them on our products and services 
our direct mail  email and online promotions are designed to highlight specific benefits of our services and offer limited time incentives to enter into purchase or evaluation agreements 
in our webinars  our senior executives and other panelists who may include independent it analysts  senior executives of our customers and partners  and other industry experts  educate prospective customers on esdm and other topics relevant to our business 
our co branding with software spectrum for sales of sun software and maintenance helps us penetrate highly qualified market segments 
we also use trade shows  event sponsorships  and regional marketing to target key audiences  expand our customer base and heighten awareness of the intraware brand 
we also hold user conferences and periodic meetings with our customers to educate them on our service offerings  gather feedback from them about our services  and learn about their evolving requirements 
competition the esdm market is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive  and we expect competition to increase in the future 
our primary competition comes from our potential customers  including software companies and other companies that distribute software or digital goods  who choose to develop an in house alternative to the subscribenet service 
however  we also face increasing competition from a small number of other providers of outsourced electronic software delivery services 
a number of these competitors have historically provided related services  such as e commerce services  replication and distribution of physical media such as cds  or product lifecycle management solutions  and relatively recently have begun to provide electronic software delivery services 
we believe this trend will continue as software and other digital goods companies convert from physical to digital distribution of their products  stimulating additional demand for esdm services 
we believe we compete effectively as a result of our early deployment of a centralized  high capacity  web based  customizable esdm solution containing valuable administrative and reporting tools 
principal competitive factors include the performance  features and functionality of an esdm solution  the comprehensiveness of the services offered by the esdm provider  such as integration with licensing and physical fulfillment solutions  the cost of a provider s esdm solution versus the cost of competing esdm solutions or the cost to a potential customer of building  deploying and maintaining an alternative service in house  the esdm provider s experience in and focus on providing esdm services  the esdm provider s track record of successful project implementations  positive references by the esdm provider s existing customers  and the openness of an esdm solution s architecture and the ease with which it integrates with major customer relations management  order processing and enterprise resource planning systems used by software providers 
we believe we compete effectively as to all of these factors 
we believe our principal advantages include our relatively senior position as one of the first esdm service providers  the depth and breadth of features and functionality of an esdm solution  our high capacity  high availability network for delivery of enterprise class software applications rapidly and securely  the suite of services that we offer through alliances  including licensing  desktop deployment  and on demand physical fulfillment  the price of our solution  particularly compared with the cost to software providers of developing and maintaining an alternative service in house  our strong track record of successful project implementations  existing customers who are willing to provide positive references  the flexibility of our solution  which is easily customized and integrated with customers erp  crm and licensing systems  and our suite of administrative and reporting tools that add value for software companies and their end users 
nevertheless  we face a number of competitive challenges 
a key challenge is resistance from software companies that determine  for perceived strategic reasons or based on their cost assessments  that they do not wish to outsource electronic software delivery 
another principal challenge is our focus on esdm  and our reliance on third party alliances for key ancillary services such as hosted license generation and desktop deployment 
while we believe our focus has enabled us to offer a superior esdm solution to our competitors  and our integration with best of breed ancillary solutions addresses a broad set of customer needs  some prospective customers prefer this set of solutions to be supported by a single provider 
a third principal challenge is our small size  as some large software providers prefer to outsource services to larger suppliers with greater resources 
in addition  many of our competitors have longer and more profitable operating histories than we have 
they may also have significantly greater financial and other resources  wider name recognition  and a larger installed base of customers including non esdm customers than we have 
they also may be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can  which would allow them to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
in addition  many of our competitors have existing relationships with divisions of our current or potential customers  and may be able to leverage their existing relationships to discourage these customers from purchasing additional services or products from us  or may be able to persuade these customers to replace our services or products with their own 
intellectual property  proprietary rights and licenses our future success depends in part on our proprietary rights and technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary rights 
although we seek to take advantage of available intellectual property protections  we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel  new product developments  frequent product enhancements and reliable product maintenance are more essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position 
there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 
to date  we own three us patents on electronic commerce technologies  expiring in july  september  and february  respectively 
in addition  we have four patent applications pending in the united states on our subscribenet esdm technology 
we plan to file additional patent applications on our subscribenet esdm technology in the current fiscal year 
we have trademark registrations in the united states 
our key registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks include intraware  subscribenet  the way digital goods move  and control your technology 
we also hold registrations and pending applications for a number of trademarks and service marks outside the united states 
we are aware that certain other companies are using the name intraware as a company name or as a trademark or service mark outside the united states 
while we do not believe we have infringed any rights and we have received no notice of any claims of infringement from any of those companies  and we own registrations for the intraware trademark in the united states and in other countries  we can make no assurance that these or other companies will not claim superior rights to intraware or other marks used in our business 
we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners  and generally control access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  it may be possible for unauthorized parties to copy certain portions of our products or services  or reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
there can be no assurance that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states 
we purchase licenses and will continue to purchase licenses for certain products integral to our services and products  including products which are integrated with our software code and used with our products to provide key functionality 
we cannot be assured that these third party product licenses will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or that we will be able to successfully integrate such third party products into our solutions

item legal proceedings 
in re intraware  inc initial public offering securities litigation in october  we were served with a summons and complaint in a purported securities class action lawsuit 
on or about april   we were served with an amended complaint in this action  which is now titled in re intraware  inc initial public offering securities litigation  civ 
no 
sas sdny  related to in re initial public offering securities litigation  mc sas sdny the amended complaint is brought purportedly on behalf of all persons who purchased our common stock from february  the date of our initial public offering through december  it names as defendants intraware  three of our present and former officers and directors  and several investment banking firms that served as underwriters of our initial public offering 
the complaint alleges liability under sections and of the securities act of and sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  on the grounds that the registration statement for the offerings did not disclose that the underwriters had agreed to allow certain customers to purchase shares in the offerings in exchange for excess commissions paid to the underwriters  and the underwriters had arranged for certain customers to purchase additional shares in the aftermarket at predetermined prices 
the amended complaint also alleges that the underwriters misused their securities analysts to manipulate the price of our stock 
no specific damages are claimed 
lawsuits containing similar allegations have been filed in the southern district of new york challenging over other initial public offerings and secondary offerings conducted in and all of these lawsuits have been consolidated for pretrial purposes before united states district court judge shira scheindlin of the southern district of new york 
on july   an omnibus motion to dismiss was filed in the coordinated litigation on behalf of the issuer defendants  of which intraware and its three named current and former officers and directors are a part  on common pleadings issues 
on or about october   the court entered and ordered a stipulation of dismissal  which dismissed the three named current and former officers and directors from the litigation without prejudice 
on february   the court entered an order denying in part the issuer defendants omnibus motion to dismiss  including those portions of the motion to dismiss relating to intraware 
in june  a stipulation of settlement for the claims against the issuer defendants  including us  was submitted to the court 
the underwriter defendants in the in re initial public offering securities litigation collectively  the underwriter defendants  including the underwriters of our initial public offering  are not parties to the stipulation of settlement 
the settlement provides that  in exchange for a release of claims against the settling issuer defendants  the insurers of all of the settling issuer defendants will provide a surety undertaking to guarantee plaintiffs a billion recovery from the non settling defendants  including the underwriter defendants 
the amount our insurers would be required to pay to the plaintiffs could range from zero to approximately million  depending on plaintiffs recovery from the underwriter defendants and from other non settling parties 
if the plaintiffs recover at least billion from the underwriter defendants  our insurers would have no liability for settlement payments under the terms of the settlement 
if the plaintiffs recover less than billion  we believe our insurance will likely cover our share of any payments towards satisfying plaintiffs billion recovery deficit 
management estimates that its range of loss relative to this matter is zero to million 
presently there is no more likely point estimate of loss within this range 
as a consequence of the uncertainties described above regarding the amount we will ultimately be required to pay  if any  as of february   we have not accrued a liability for this matter 
there is no guarantee the settlement will become final  as it is subject to a number of conditions  including the final approval of the court
