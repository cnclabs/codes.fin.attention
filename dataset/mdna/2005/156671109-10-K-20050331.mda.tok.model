item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview contained in this discussion and elsewhere in this annual report are forward looking statements which management believes to be reasonable and informative 
such statements are based on assumptions which may not prove to be correct for reasons management cannot predict 
consequently  the inclusion of forward looking statements should not be considered as representations by the trust or its management that expected results will be achieved or that stated objectives will be attained 
several factors that might cause such a difference are identified at the end of this discussion 
during all of and the trust owned or controlled  as continuing operations  thirteen apartment communities containing  apartment units  three multi tenant commercial properties containing  rentable square feet  and one restaurant property leased to an operator under month to month net lease 
comparative information related to income and expenses contained in this discussion applies to continuing operation only  unless otherwise indicated 
in april   the trust sold the unit park plaza apartments  and in december  contracted to sell the unit fox run apartments 
in a separate sale contract  the trust agreed to sell to an unrelated buyer  the restaurant property previously operated as the fortune house 
management expects to complete the restaurant property sale in the second quarter of and the fox run sale in the third quarter of in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
 the net investments in those three properties are presented in the consolidated balance sheets as real estate held for sale 
the gain realized from the sale of the park plaza apartments  and the results of operations for it and the other two properties held for sale  for years ended december   and  are summarized and shown in the consolidated statements of operations as income or loss from discontinued operations 
the three sale transactions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
five apartment properties containing units are owned by five separate partnerships that are controlled by the trust through a wholly owned subsidiary 
holders of operating partnership units have the option to exchange them  one for one  for shares of beneficial interest in the trust at any time until november  as of december  and  holders of and  respectively of the outstanding units  had exercised their exchange options 
see note to the financial statements 
management anticipates that the increase in outstanding shares and corresponding decrease in the minority interest will not have a material impact on net income per share during the next year 
at december  the trust s net investment in real estate consisted of apartment properties  commercial properties and net leased restaurant properties 
the  apartment units in the portfolio throughout and contributed and  respectively  of the total revenue from continuing real estate operations  and and  respectively  of continuing real estate operating expenses 
critical accounting policies amortization of management contracts 
in the trust paid  for the general partner interest and absolute management control over five partnerships 
the trust elected to amortize  on a straight line method  its cost to acquire its position over the ten year period during which the holders of limited partnership units could elect to  or not elect to  exchange those units for shares of beneficial interest of the trust  consequently  depreciation expense each year includes  for amortization of the acquisition costs 
carpet replacement policy 
from its inception in  the trust has consistently followed the practice of charging the cost to replace carpets in its apartment units to expense as incurred 
real estate operating expenses include costs to replace carpets of   and  for  and respectively 
an acceptable alternative method of accounting would be the capitalization of costs as incurred  followed by charges for depreciation over the estimated useful life of the carpet 
management believes that  due to the relatively short useful life of apartment carpets  the annual expense for replacements is not materially greater than would be the annual charges for depreciation had the carpets been capitalized when purchased 
impairment of long lived assets 
when an event or change in circumstance indicates that future undiscounted cash flows and net realizable value is insufficient to recover the carrying value of a long lived asset  the asset value is reduced to fair market value and an impairment loss is recognized 
results of operations compared with  rental and related income from the trust s continuing apartment operations increased by while apartment operating expenses  exclusive of depreciation  increased by 
the increase in gross income from apartment properties resulted from the net effect of higher average rental rates and a increase in overall occupancy rates 
apartment economic occupancy rates increased from an average of in to in in mid december  the aggregate physical occupancy rate for the trust s apartment properties was up from in mid december  the increasing trend in occupancy rates that commenced in the fourth quarter of is due primarily to intensive marketing efforts and the use of rental incentives and discounts 
the lack of employment opportunities in several indiana communities  and relatively low mortgage loan interest rates continue to make home ownership a viable alternative for residents of higher rent apartments 
real estate operating expenses  including real estate taxes excluding interest and depreciation for the apartment properties increased 
in operating expenses amounted to of gross possible income for  down from in maintenance and repairs and building services expenses were lower in  however  those decreases were more than offset by higher site personnel costs 
real estate taxes estimated to be payable in that were accrued in  decreased by from amounts that were accrued in real estate tax accruals for amounts estimated to be payable in decreased by  from comparable accruals in due to successful appeals for reduction of assessed values that resulted from an indiana statewide reassessment of real property as of march  some further reductions are possible from appeals that are still pending for four properties 
in addition to the reduction in the amounts accrued for payment in  additional benefits were realized from refunds of taxes accrued for payments in and those prior year overpayments credited against real estate tax expense in amounted to  mortgage interest expense for decreased by  from the amount reported for approximately  of that decrease is attributable to lower interest rates on three mortgage loans that were refinanced in the balance of the decrease is attributed primarily to a reduction in mortgage loan balances that resulted from scheduled monthly debt service 
general and administrative expenses in increased by  from the previous year primarily due to an increase in amounts incurred for professional fees

an appeal for a reduction of the new assessed values has been filed by the trust 
a year lease that began in expired in november  the lessee elected not to renew the lease  and vacated the property 
in addition to the loss of revenue from the property  the trust accrued  in for estimated real estate taxes payable in under the prior lease  the lessee was responsible for real estate taxes 
results of operations compared with  rental and related income from the trust s apartment operations decreased by while apartment operating expenses  exclusive of depreciation  increased by 
the decrease in gross income from apartment properties resulted from the net effect of 
higher average rental rates and a decrease in overall occupancy rates 
apartment economic occupancy rates decreased from an average of in to in in mid december  the aggregate physical occupancy rate for the trust s apartment properties had improved to from in mid december of the downward trend in occupancy rates from the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of is due primarily to a decline in employment opportunities in several indiana communities  and relatively low mortgage loan interest rates that continue to make home ownership a viable alternative for residents of higher rent apartments 
the board of trustees and management have taken action to counter the recent disappointing operating results 
during  the trust changed management firms for its apartment properties 
the board selected a management firm that it believes to have a highly qualified staff  a proactive management philosophy and particular strength in marketing 
while the management change was costly in  apartment occupancy has been steadily  albeit slowly  improving 
real estate operating expenses  including real estate taxes excluding interest and depreciation for the apartment properties increased in operating expenses amounted to of gross possible income for  up from in utility costs were up due to higher rates and the cost of providing electricity and heat to vacant units 
carpet and tile replacement costs increased by to provide rental incentive and to catch up from a lower than average expense level in the previous year 
maintenance and repairs increased by from the amount represented of gross potential income  a level that management considers normal for the trust s portfolio 
real estate tax accruals for amounts estimated to be payable in increased by  or from comparable accruals in due to an indiana statewide reassessment of real property 
contrary to the significant increase in real estate taxes following reassessment of the apartment properties  each one of the commercial properties experienced lower assessed values and lower billings for taxes payable in the trust  in its accruals in  underestimated by approximately  the amount of real estate tax payable in that underestimate was a charge against income in in addition to the amount accrued as an operating expense in for taxes payable in on site personnel costs  as a percent of gross possible income  were up from in to in  a increase 
mortgage interest expense for decreased by  from the amount reported for approximately  of that decrease is attributable to lower interest rates on three mortgage loans that were refinanced in july  the balance of the decrease is attributed primarily to a reduction in mortgage loan balances that resulted from scheduled monthly debt service 
no mortgage loans were refinanced in general and administrative expenses in decreased by  from due primarily to a reduction in amounts incurred for professional fees 
in the trust expensed approximately  primarily legal fees  related to the transfer of rental operations to century realty properties  lp and  for real estate appraisal fees

general and administrative expenses amounted to of income from real estate operations in  compared with in officer and employee compensation  including payroll taxes and benefits  amounted to  in  up from  in in the trust sold the park plaza apartments and executed contracts to sell the fox run apartments and the property formerly known as the fortune house restaurant 
in accordance with provisions regarding sales of long lived assets of fas no 
 operating results of the three aforementioned properties were reclassified to income or loss from discontinued operations for prior periods 
the changes in income and expenses attributable to discontinued operations are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the trust realized an operating loss of  in and operating income of  in from the three properties as follows park plaza apartments   fox run apartments   fortune house restaurant   total income loss   during park plaza had occupancy of and operating expenses were  compared with occupancy of and operating expenses of for all of the decline in occupancy accounted for a decrease in revenue of  while the increase in expenses amounted to  during fox run had occupancy of and operating expenses of of gross possible income  compared with occupancy of and operating expenses of for the decline in occupancy accounted for a decrease in revenue of  the increase in the portion of gross possible income used for operating expenses amounted to  of additional costs 
marketing  decorating and carpeting costs intended to improve occupancy accounted for most of the increase in operating expenses 
the decline in income from the fortune house restaurant property reflects the scheduled decrease in the amount of previously deferred income recognized during the year 
contractual obligations the following schedule represents the trust s obligations as of december  to make future payments under contracts  such as mortgage debt  lease agreements  and other long term obligations amounts in thousands payments due by period within to to after obligations total year years years years mortgage notes      capital leases operating leases purchase obligations other tenants deposits totals      the trust is a lessee of certain office equipment  such as copying machines and postage equipment  which represent insignificant obligations 
the trust holds security deposits by tenants of its rental properties 
individual deposits that are refunded  in whole or in part  when a tenant vacates  are replaced by similar deposits received from incoming tenants 
changes in the aggregate amount of deposits held during any given period are not material 
a mortgage loan on the land and buildings of the fox run apartments is scheduled to mature march  with a balance due of  the fox run apartments are under contract to be sold on terms that permit the buyer to delay closing of the sale until the third quarter of the mortgagor has granted an extension of the maturity date until the earlier of the closing date of the sale or december  liquidity and sources of capital at december   the trust and its controlled partnerships had  in cash  including  in controlled partnership accounts  which management believes is sufficient to meet anticipated working capital requirements 
other than the gain realized from the sale of an apartment property in  the trust s investment properties have not produced sufficient cash flow since the first half of to justify distributions to shareholders 
in december  the trust distributed per share  all of which was designated as capital gain 
due to better than expected operating results in the fourth quarter of  an additional per share of capital gain will be paid in the trust intends to resume quarterly distributions when operating results permit 
other than cash that may be required for property improvements and replacements which amounts may exceed funds generated by operations  management is not aware of any significant transactions or events which will require material expenditures in management is considering recommendations by the property managers to undertake significant exterior painting and paving projects 
the trust has not made any commitments  which would require expenditures in excess of funds expected to be provided by operations during management expects to continue to operate as a qualified real estate investment trust  and to distribute to shareholders all of its otherwise taxable income 
since the trust s net income for consisted entirely of gain from the sale of property  the  that was distributed to shareholders in  was designated as capital gain 
during  the trust distributed  all of which was designated as return of capital 
the aggregate surplus cash distributed to the minority interest partners by the controlled partnerships totaled  during there were no distributions by the controlled partnerships in due to differences in depreciation rates and carrying values of some properties  the net income reported for was more than taxable income 
the reported net loss for  was more than the loss for tax purposes  and  for  reported net income was less than taxable income 
impact of inflation inflation  except for increases in real estate taxes payable in that resulted from the indiana state wide reassessment of real estate  has not had a significant impact on the trust during  and business risk factors and prospects among the factors  some of which are beyond the control of management  that could affect the trust s business and results of its operations in the future are the following failure to generate sufficient marginal revenue to offset the marginal costs to comply with internal control documentation and related auditing requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of failure by the trust and its principal management agent to attract and retain qualified management personnel in key positions 
long term unfavorable apartment market and economic conditions that adversely effect occupancy and rental rates 
difficulty selling properties that no longer meet the trust s investment criteria 
unforeseen impediments in closing sales of properties that are under contract to be sold 
competitive factors that may inhibit the trust s ability to lease apartments or to maintain or increase rental rates
