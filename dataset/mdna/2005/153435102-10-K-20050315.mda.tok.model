the rate of inflation in poland was in  in  and in using average national bank of poland exchange rates for the full year  the zloty in comparison to the us dollar appreciated by in  in and in on may   poland joined the european union and  as a result  products manufactured within the european union will no longer be subject to import duties  which may have a positive impact on the company s future business as the pricing of the company s imported product portfolio becomes aligned with local product 
it is important to note that while poland joined the european union in may  joining the european union does not automatically result in joining the euro zone 
this is a separate process with different admission requirements 
poland is currently forecasting joining the euro zone in in order to aid understanding  we have prepared tables which segment the income statement information as presented in the financial statements into those elements of the income statement which relate to operations acquired by the company during the reporting period and those which relate to operations owned in both reporting periods

normal trade terms from the company s polish vodka suppliers are days  however  the company is offered by some of these suppliers significant discounts if the company pays for goods when delivered 
the discounts offered are considerably in excess of the effective rate the company would pay for day terms on our bank facilities 
cod is also referenced in discussions regarding margin and short term banking facilities

the company s working capital requirements are also seasonal  and are normally highest in the months of december and january 
liquidity then normally improves as collections are made on the seasonally higher fourth quarter receivables 
other matters the company continues to be involved in litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
in management s opinion  the litigation in which the company is currently involved  individually and in the aggregate  is not material to the company s financial condition or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of net sales  expenses  assets and liabilities 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
provisions for doubtful debts the company makes general provision for doubtful debt based on the aging of its trade receivables 
where circumstances require  the company will make specific provision for any excess not provided for under the general provision 
inventory because of the nature of the products supplied by the company  great attention is paid to inventory rotation 
where goods are estimated to obsolete or unmarketable they are written down to a value reflecting the saleable value in their relevant condition 

table of contents during the fourth quarter of  the company changed its inventory valuation methodology to better reflect the impact of volume related supplier discounts and the costs associated with storage and handling 
the basis of the adjustment is to reduce inventory and thereby reduce operating profit by the amount of volume related supplier bonuses deemed to be within closing inventory 
against this an allocation of overheads which are attributable to inventory receipt and storage is added to inventory and thereby increases operating profit 
goodwill and intangibles acquired goodwill is no longer amortized as required by fasb instead the company assesses the recoverability of its goodwill at least once a year or whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances or business climate indicate that expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges for individual business units may not be sufficient to support the recorded goodwill 
if undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to support the goodwill  an impairment charge would be recognized to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill based on the expected discounted cash flows of the business unit 
no such charge has been considered necessary through the date of the accompanying financial statements 
intangibles trademarks are amortized over years 
the calculation of the impairment charge for goodwill requires use of estimates 
factoring in a deviation of for estimated gross profit of the acquired entities  or the discount rate as compared to managements estimate  there would still be no need for an impairment charge of goodwill 
purchase price allocation the company accounts for its acquisition under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  and allocate the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
the determination of the values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as associated asset useful lives  will require management to make estimates 
due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
r  share based payments  a revision of the prior fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock based compensation 
the statement offers a number of possibilities for implementation 
the company has elected to implement the modified prospective application  which will require the company to begin to recognize the impact of the change in july and will not restate any prior periods 
the expected impact during the second half of is approximately million  based upon current market conditions 
management of the company is still in the process of evaluating what forms of compensation may be introduced in future periods in lieu of the existing option program 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk exchange rate fluctuations translation risks the company s operations are conducted primarily in poland and its functional currency is the polish zloty and the reporting currency is the us dollar 
the company s financial instruments consist mainly of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and receivable  inventories  bank loans  overdraft facilities and long term debt 
all of the monetary assets represented by these financial instruments are located in poland 
consequently  they are subject to currency translation risk when reporting in us dollars 
if the us dollar increases in value against the polish zloty  the value in us dollars of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses originally recorded in polish zloty will decrease 
conversely  if the us dollar decreases in value against the polish zloty  the value in us dollars of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses originally recorded in polish zloty will increase 
thus  increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar can have an impact on the value in us dollar of our us dollar assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  even if the value of these items has not changed in their original currency 
transaction risk commercial exposure 
the company s commercial foreign exchange exposure mainly arises from the purchase of imported alcoholic beverage in currencies other than the company s functional currency of the polish zloty 
thus  accounts payable for imported beverages are billed in various currencies and the company is subject to short term changes in the currency markets for product purchases 
the company also operates a bonded warehouse where the inventory acquired from foreign suppliers is recorded in its source currency 
thus  any currency movement on trade payables resulting from either a strengthening or weakening of the polish zloty against a foreign suppliers currency is often compensated for by an opposite movement relating to inventories recorded in the imported currency 
below is a table indicating the respective trade payables  trade receivables and imported inventory in us dollars usd  british pounds sterling gbp and euro eur 
in thousands trade payables local currency usd equivalent local currency usd equivalent usd gbp eur total inventories local currency usd equivalent local currency usd equivalent usd gbp eur total trade receivables local currency usd equivalent local currency usd equivalent usd gbp eur total 
table of contents financial exposure 
the company s general policy requires our subsidiaries to borrow funds and invest excess cash in the same currency as their functional currency  the polish zloty  where these funds were needed for and generated by operations 
where funds were needed for investment and acquisition purposes in previous years  they have been taken in us dollar and euro 
total exposure to various currencies on the company s bank funding for december  and is given in the table below 
during  the company experienced higher polish zloty borrowing rates with an increase in the one month warsaw inter bank rate wibor from at the end of  to at the end of  resulting in higher interest expense for the year 
thousands of usd bank loans payable in polish zloty bank overdrafts payable in polish zloty total bank funding loans with a contractual term of one year have been automatically renewed in the past and the company expects them to be renewed in the future 
bank loans and overdrafts denominated in polish zloty are also renewable after one year and have been presented according to their legal form 
more details of the repayments dates and conditions of both the short term and long term loans can be found in note of the financial statements 
bank borrowings are sensitive to interest and foreign currency market risks as they usually bear interest at variable rates and are denominated in various currencies 
exchange rates december  december  polish zloty us dollar polish zloty euro interest rate fluctuations the company may have an exposure to interest rate movements through its bank deposits and indebtedness 
during  the company used derivative financial instruments forward foreign currency contracts to hedge transactions denominated in foreign currencies in order to reduce the currency risk associated with fluctuating exchange rates 
the duration of the hedge contract typically did not exceed six months 
at year end the company had no open derivative contracts 
because all of the company s debts are at floating rates  changes in interest rates may impact its net interest expense  positively by way of a reduction in base rates and adversely should base rates rise 
the company s sensitivity to interest rate movements is expressed in the table below
