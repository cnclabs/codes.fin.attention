overview founded in  foundry designs  develops  manufactures  markets and sells a comprehensive  end to end suite of high performance data networking solutions  including ethernet layer and layer switches  metro routers  and internet traffic management products 
our customers include us government agencies  universities  e commerce sites  and enterprises such as healthcare  financial  manufacturing and entertainment companies  as well as internet and metro service providers 
business environment over the course of the last several years  we believe the overall global economy has continued to strengthen  and capital spending on it infrastructure  particularly data networking equipment  has also improved 
the overall data networking market grew over during  with significant growth in market sectors in which we do not have a heavy concentration 
during  we saw the early signs of a broad enterprise network upgrade cycle as customers began to focus on newer technology  particularly gigabit ethernet 
there are also indications that the global carrier and service provider market is beginning to increase its investment in data networking infrastructure 
the market for data networking products continues to be dominated by cisco systems  inc  with over share of the networking market 
we continue to invest in our core market and adjacent markets in which the competitive landscape looks attractive and the growth prospects are promising 
although we expect our revenues to grow modestly in  there is no assurance that the networking market will continue to improve or that we will be successful in capitalizing on this improvement 

table of contents financial performance marked our sixth consecutive year with net income since we went public in september our revenues for increased to million  from million in  due to an increase of million in service revenue 
despite increased sales volume in  our product revenues were nearly flat as a result of price erosion and a shift in sales mix to lower priced stackable products 
our customer base grew to  customers at the end of  from  customers at the end of in october  we entered into a settlement agreement and patent cross license agreement with nortel  pursuant to which we paid million to nortel and recorded an operating expense of million in the third quarter of the remaining amount paid to nortel represents consideration for a four year patent cross license with nortel and is being amortized ratably to cost of product revenue over the license term 
the litigation settlement reduced net income by million  net of tax 
net income in was million  or of total net revenues  compared to million  or of total net revenues  in in  we expanded our sales organization and research and development team 
this investment in our infrastructure  as well as a litigation settlement expense of million and related legal fees  reduced our profitability in our balance sheet remains debt free  with cash and investments of million  an increase of million from during  we generated million of cash from operations and received million of cash from employee stock option exercises 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period reported 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  market trends  current economic conditions  and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates that can have a significant effect on our results of operations and the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of foundry s board of directors 
these and other significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
revenue recognition we generate the majority of our revenue from sales of stackable and chassis based networking equipment  with the remainder of our revenue coming from customer support fees  training and installation services 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery or performance has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
product revenue is generally recognized upon transfer of title  unless an acceptance period or other contingency exists  in which case revenue is recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period  or upon satisfaction of the contingency 

table of contents support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the support arrangement  in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb technical bulletin  accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts 
when sales arrangements contain multiple elements eg  hardware and installation  we apply the provisions of emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf to determine the separate units of accounting that exist within the arrangement 
if more than one unit of accounting exists  the arrangement consideration is allocated to each unit of accounting using either the relative fair value method or the residual fair value method as prescribed by eitf revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting when the revenue recognition criteria described above have been met for that unit of accounting 
the application of eitf involves significant judgment 
for example  we use judgment to determine whether objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for undelivered item s in an arrangement 
the timing of revenue recognition varies based on this determination 
at the time product revenue is recognized  we estimate the amount of warranty costs to be incurred and record the amount as a cost of revenue 
our standard warranty period generally extends months from the date of sale for hardware and days for software  and our estimate of the amount necessary to settle warranty claims is based primarily on our past experience 
although we believe our estimate is adequate and that the judgment we apply is appropriate  actual warranty costs could differ materially from our estimate 
if actual warranty costs are greater than initially estimated  our cost of revenues could increase in the future 
we also provide a provision for estimated customer returns at the time product revenue is recognized 
our provision is based primarily on historical sales returns and our return policies 
our resellers generally do not have a right of return  and our contracts with original equipment manufacturers only provide for rights of return in the event our products do not meet specifications or there is an epidemic failure  as defined in the contracts 
if historical data used by us to calculate estimated sales returns does not reasonably approximate future returns  revenue in future periods could be affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts customers are subject to a credit review process  which evaluates the customer s financial condition and ability to pay  and are generally assigned a credit limit that may be increased only after a successful collection history has been established 
we continually monitor and evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivables and actively manage our accounts receivable to minimize credit risk 
we record specific allowances for doubtful accounts when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or significant deterioration in financial condition 
we estimate allowances for doubtful accounts for all other customers based on factors such as current economic and industry trends  the extent to which receivables are past due  and historical collection experience 
if circumstances change  estimates regarding the collectibility of receivables would be adjusted 
we mitigate some collection risk by requiring certain international customers to provide letters of credit or bank guarantees prior to placing an order with us 
although we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate and that the judgment we apply is appropriate  our actual amount of bad debt could differ materially from our estimates 
inventories the networking industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements  and evolving industry standards 
our inventory purchases and commitments are made based on anticipated demand for our products  as estimated by management  and our expected service requirements 
we perform an assessment of our inventory each quarter  which includes a review of  among other factors  demand requirements  manufacturing lead times  product life cycles and development plans  product pricing and quality issues 
based on this analysis  we estimate the amount of excess and obsolete inventory on hand and make adjustments to record inventory at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value 
once inventory has been written down to the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value  it is reflected on our balance sheet at its new carrying cost until it is sold or otherwise disposed 

table of contents we use contract manufacturers to assemble and test our products 
we also utilize third party oems to manufacture certain foundry branded products 
in order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure an adequate supply of inventories  our agreements with some of these manufacturers allow them to procure long lead time component inventory on our behalf based on rolling production forecasts provided by us 
we may be contractually obligated to purchase long lead time component inventory procured by certain manufacturers in accordance with our forecasts although we can generally give notice of order cancellation at least days prior to the delivery date 
in addition  we issue purchase orders to our component suppliers that may not be cancelable at any time 
as of december   we had approximately million of open purchase orders with our component suppliers and third party manufacturers that may not be cancelable 
if actual demand for our products is below the level assumed in our production forecasts  we may have excess inventory or a liability as a result of our purchase commitments 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we recognize deferred tax assets based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining whether valuation allowances should be recorded against our deferred tax assets 
management assesses the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized against projected future taxable income or our ability to generate taxable income from specific sources  and to the extent that realization is not believed to be more likely than not  a valuation allowance is established 
in the event we determine that we are unable to realize some or all of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to our deferred tax assets would be necessary  resulting in a charge to income in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be realized  the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
our net deferred tax assets as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
loss contingencies we are subject to the possibility of loss contingencies in the normal course of our business  including those related to intellectual property and securities litigation 
a loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we continually reassess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies  as well as potential ranges of probable losses  and will recognize a liability  if any  for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel and other experts 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r also amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows  to require that tax benefits from stock option exercises be classified as a financing activity  instead of an operating activity  on the statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values  beginning with the first interim or annual period after june  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we are required to adopt sfas r in our third quarter of  beginning july  under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for recognizing compensation cost  and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive option  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  whereas under the retroactive method we would record compensation 
table of contents expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
we are evaluating the requirements of sfas r and expect its adoption to have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations 
we have not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas r  nor have we determined whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas see note of the consolidated financial statements in item for a description of other recent accounting pronouncements 
results of operations net revenues we offer products in two configuration platforms  a fixed configuration stackable and a flexible configuration chassis 
a stackable has a fixed configuration that cannot be altered 
a chassis uses a modular platform that can be populated and reconfigured with various management and line card modules as frequently as desired by the customer 
for example  customers can use our chassis products at the edge of their network and then reconfigure the chassis to be used in the backbone or core of their network 
our selling prices and gross margins on chassis based products are generally higher than our stackable products because of the flexible configuration offered by chassis based products 
net revenue information is as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  of net of net of net revenues revenues revenues net revenues product service total net revenues chassis stackable total net revenues net product revenues in decreased from  despite increased sales volume  as a result of lower average selling prices and a shift in sales mix to lower priced stackable products 
although the overall global economy improved in  the pricing environment remained competitive 
as a result  we experienced an increase in overall port shipments of  but the decline in average selling prices and a shift to lower priced stackable products resulted in flat product revenues 
our sales volume increased in primarily due to sales of our gigabit ethernet stackable products  which offer a similar feature set as our small end chassis at a lower price point 
stackable products generated of our total net revenues in  versus in sales to the us government represented of our total revenues in  down from in  as a result of less federal funding for it projects in the decrease in sales to the us government was offset by increased business from our enterprise customers 
net product revenues increased from to due to an increase in overall it spending  increased market share  and expanded sales coverage 
during  we focused our sales efforts on broadening our customer base  particularly in non cyclical customer verticals  such as healthcare  research enterprises  government agencies  and universities  that typically demonstrate continued capital spending during slow economic cycles 
sales to the us government were particularly strong in  accounting for of our total revenues  compared to in  due to the government s effort to both expand and upgrade their networks 
in late  the federal government certified many of our jetcore based products for sale to the department of defense dod 
once certified  we generated significant revenue from sales of these products to the dod 
we also experienced significant revenue growth in japan in due to the establishment of a 
table of contents direct sales force in to complement our reseller relationship with mitsui  one of our largest resellers 
in  our expanded sales coverage in japan resulted in significant sales growth in that country 
service revenues consist primarily of revenue from customer support contracts  and to a lesser extent  from providing training and installation services 
service revenues increased million  or  in and million  or  in the increase in absolute dollars was due to a larger installed base of our networking equipment each year as customers purchased new support contracts with their new equipment purchases and renewed maintenance contracts on existing equipment 
our customer base grew from  customers at the end of  to  customers at the end of  and to  customers at the end of we manage our business based on four geographic regions the americas primarily the united states  europe  the middle east  and africa emea  japan  and asia pacific 
we determine revenues by geographic location based on the physical destination of our product shipments 
net product revenue by region as a percentage of net product revenue was as follows for the years ended december americas emea japan asia pacific the shift in product sales from japan to emea in was due to large deployments of our products in europe by the us government and several other large customers during  compared to large deployments of our products by major service providers in japan during gross margins the following table presents gross margins and gross margin percentages for product and service revenues dollars in thousands year ended december  gross gross gross margin margin margin gross margins product service total gross margin our cost of product revenues consists primarily of materials  labor  manufacturing overhead  warranty costs  and provisions for excess and obsolete inventory 
although we experienced an overall decline in average selling prices in  product gross margins in were higher than as a result of favorable product mix and lower contract manufacturing and component costs in  offset somewhat by increased inventory provisions 
inventory provisions were million and million in and  respectively 
inventory provisions increased as a result of higher levels of inventory in and challenges associated with forecasting demand and managing supply for our broader product portfolio 
the increase in product gross margin as a percentage of product revenues in from was due primarily to cost efficiencies associated with increased business volume in and significant reductions of our component and sub assembly costs 
product margins improved to a lesser extent as a result of increased sales of our high end  high margin products in and lower provisions for excess and obsolete inventory 
during  our total port shipments of all products increased by from  and our shipments of gigabit ethernet ports  a higher gross margin product  grew by 
this shift in product mix was due to our customers increasing preference for gigabit ethernet  a layer switching technology and higher gross margin product  instead of ethernet  a layer technology and lower gross margin product 
this product mix shift contributed to our gross margin improvement in during the first nine months of  
table of contents our component and assembly costs were reduced significantly  which dramatically improved our gross margins 
in the fourth quarter of  our component and assembly costs stabilized 
our cost of service revenues consists primarily of costs related to providing services under customer support contracts  including maintaining adequate spares inventory levels at service depots 
service costs include material costs  labor  and overhead 
service gross margins were in  down from in both and despite significantly higher service revenues in and  our service gross margin percentage decreased in and remained unchanged in from  as a result of increased service inventory and labor costs associated with supporting a larger customer base and a broader product portfolio 
as noted above  our customer base grew considerably between and due to the expansion of our customer base throughout the world  we continued to increase our investment in our support infrastructure by opening more service facilities and supplying them with adequate spares inventory to support our increasingly broader product offerings 
we expect service gross margins to experience variability over time due to the timing of technical support initiations and renewals and additional investments in our customer support infrastructure 
our gross margins may be adversely affected by increased price competition  component shortages  increases in material or labor costs  excess and obsolete inventory charges  changes in channels of distribution  or customer  product and geographic mix 
see also risk factors our gross margins may decline over time and the average selling prices of our products may decrease as a result of competitive pressures and other factors 
operating expenses the following table presents research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses for the years ended december    and dollars in thousands year ended december  of net of net of net revenues revenues revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative litigation settlement research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  prototype materials  and expenses related to the development of our asics  software development and testing costs  and the depreciation of property and equipment used in research and development activities 
research and development expenses in increased million from due primarily to higher payroll costs and depreciation expense 
average headcount increased in and depreciation expense increased as a result of significant purchases of advanced test equipment during the first half of the increase in research and development expenses in was due primarily to prototype expenses incurred in connection with development of our terabit capacity ethernet switching products  and  to a lesser extent  an increase in our average headcount from engineers in to engineers in we believe continued investment in product enhancements and new product development is critical to achieving our strategic objectives  and  as a result  we expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and customer support activities  costs associated with trade shows  advertising  and promotions  and the cost of facilities 
sales and marketing expenses increased million in  primarily due to increases of million for advertising and trade shows  million for compensation costs  and million of depreciation associated with demonstration and evaluation equipment 
during  we increased our marketing efforts to introduce our new products such as our terabit capacity chassis and gigabit stackable products and increased our marketing and sales force to employees from in the increase in absolute dollars of million from to was primarily due to higher sales commissions as a result of increased revenues in  higher travel costs associated with expanding our sales coverage  and  to a lesser extent  increased marketing expenses associated with the launch of new products in 
table of contents general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  costs of facilities  bad debt  legal fees  and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million in  compared to  primarily due to an increase of million in legal fees related to the nortel and lucent patent infringement cases discussed in part i  item legal proceedings  million for consulting fees related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act  and million from reduced bad debt reserve requirements in  compared to no bad debt reserve requirements in general and administrative expenses increased million in  compared to  due to increases of million in legal expenses and million in executive bonuses  offset by a million decrease in bad debt expense as a result of improved collections effort and credit quality of our customer base 
litigation settlement 
in october  we entered into a settlement agreement and patent cross license agreement with nortel 
as a result of the agreements  nortel s actions for monetary damages and an injunction against us were dismissed  and our suit against nortel was also dismissed 
pursuant to the agreements  we paid million to nortel and recorded an operating expense of million in the third quarter of the remaining amount paid to nortel represents consideration for a four year cross license with nortel and is being amortized ratably to cost of product revenue over the license term 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
in connection with the granting of stock options to employees and a director  we recorded deferred stock compensation in the aggregate amount of million in and million in  representing the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair market value of our common stock on the date the stock options were granted 
we recorded no additional deferred stock compensation after deferred stock compensation was amortized to operations over the respective vesting periods of the options 
we had no remaining deferred stock compensation to amortize in we recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation expense of approximately  and million in and  respectively 
interest and other income  net 
we earn interest income on funds maintained in interest bearing money market and investment accounts 
we recorded net interest and other income of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to higher investment balances and higher interest rates throughout our total cash and investments increased million from interest income in remained nearly unchanged from  despite higher levels of cash and investments throughout  due to lower average interest rates in see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a description of our investment policy 
income taxes 
the effective tax rate was   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
these rates reflect applicable federal and state tax rates  offset by research and development tax credits  export sales incentives  and tax exempt interest income 
the lower effective tax rate of in was due to significantly higher tax exempt interest income and research and development credit as a percentage of net income 
our income taxes payable for federal and state purposes have been reduced  and stockholders equity increased  by the tax benefits associated with taxable dispositions of employee stock options 
when an employee exercises a stock option issued under a nonqualified plan  or has a disqualifying disposition related to a qualified plan  we receive an income tax benefit for the difference between the fair market value of the stock issued at the time of the exercise and the employee s option price  tax effected 
these benefits are credited directly to stockholders equity and amounted to million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and investments of million  an increase of million from million at december  the increase was primarily the result of our pre tax profitability  which enabled us to generate million of cash from operations  and the receipt of million of cash from issuances of common stock to employees 
during  cash payments for income taxes  net of refunds 
table of contents received  were million 
this is low relative to our pre tax income as a result of million of tax deductions in for disqualifying dispositions of employee stock options 
cash and investments increased million in from the increase was primarily the result of increased profitability in and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 
in  we paid relatively insignificant amounts of taxes in relation to our income before taxes because we had significant tax deductions resulting from disqualifying dispositions of employee stock options of million 
we also generated million of income before taxes and received million of cash from issuances of common stock to employees 
inventories increased million from to million as of december  we significantly increased our production and service inventory levels to support a broader product offering and larger installed customer base  and in anticipation of higher sales volume in annualized inventory turnover was approximately and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in inventory turnover in was due to lower product sales in and higher average inventory levels during the year 
accounts receivable  net of allowances  increased million from the end of to million as of december  our accounts receivable and days sales outstanding dso are primarily affected by shipment linearity  collections performance  and timing of support contract renewals 
dso  calculated based on annualized revenues for the most recent quarter ended and net accounts receivable as of the balance sheet date  increased to days as of december   from days as of december  the increase in dso was primarily due to the timing of support contract renewals 
a significant amount of annual support contracts were renewed during the fourth quarter of  with little or no revenue contribution in shipment linearity  as percentage of revenue  remained nearly unchanged during the fourth quarter of fiscal  compared to the same period in dso increased from days as of december  to days as of december  the increase in dso in was due to less linear shipments during the fourth quarter of  in which more than of our revenues shipped during the last month of the quarter 
disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table aggregates our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands more less than than total year years years operating leases of facilities purchase commitments with contract manufacturers total contractual cash obligations for purposes of the above table  contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable  legally binding on us  and that subject us to penalties if we cancel the agreement 
our purchase commitments are based on our short term manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
although it is difficult for us to predict future liquidity requirements with certainty  we believe our existing cash balances and anticipated funds from operations in will satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next months 
key factors affecting our cash flows include our ability to effectively manage our working capital  in particular  inventories and accounts receivable  and future demand for our products and related pricing 
we may incur higher capital expenditures in the near future to expand our operations 
although we do not have any current plans or commitments to do so  we may from time to time consider the 
table of contents acquisition of products or businesses complementary to our business 
any acquisition or investment may require additional capital 
off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases of facilities  we do not maintain any off balance sheet transactions  arrangements  or obligations that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
indemnifications in the ordinary course of business  we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify the counter party from losses relating to a breach of representations and warranties  a failure to perform certain covenants  or claims and losses arising from certain external events as outlined within the particular contract  which may include  for example  losses arising from litigation or claims relating to past performance 
such indemnification clauses may not be subject to maximum loss clauses 
no amounts are reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements as of december  or related to these indemnifications as  historically  payments made related to these indemnifications have not been material to our financial position or results of operations 
risk factors that may affect future results and the market price of our stock weak economic and market conditions or geopolitical turmoil may adversely affect our revenues  gross margins and expenses 
our quarterly revenues and operating results may continue to fluctuate due to the effects of general economic conditions in the united states and globally  and  in particular  market conditions in the communications and networking industries 
additionally  current political turmoil in many parts of the world  including terrorist and military actions  may weaken the global economy 
if economic conditions in the united states and globally do not improve  or if they worsen  we may experience material negative effects on our business  operating results and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve our financial results or that economic and market conditions will continue to improve and will not deteriorate 
although our customer base has increased  we still depend on large  recurring purchases from certain significant customers  and a loss  cancellation or delay in purchases by these customers could negatively affect our revenue 
sales to our ten largest customers accounted for and of net product revenue for and  respectively 
the loss of continued orders from any of our more significant customers  such as the us government or individual agencies within the us government  mitsui  or hewlett packard  could cause our revenue and profitability to suffer 
our ability to attract new customers will depend on a variety of factors  including the cost effectiveness  reliability  scalability  breadth and depth of our products 
although our financial performance may depend on large  recurring orders from certain customers and resellers  we do not generally have binding commitments from them 
for example our reseller agreements generally do not require minimum purchases  our customers can stop purchasing and our resellers can stop marketing our products at any time  and our reseller agreements generally are not exclusive and are for one year terms  with no obligation of the resellers to renew the agreements 
because our expenses are based on our revenue forecasts  a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to  or unexpected returns from  customers and resellers  or the loss of any significant customer or reseller  could harm our business 
although our largest customers may vary from period to period  we anticipate that our operating results for any given period will continue to depend on large orders from a small 
table of contents number of customers 
in addition  a change in the mix of our customers  or a change in the mix of direct and indirect sales  could adversely affect our revenues and gross margins 
the united states government is a significant customer and has been one key to our financial success 
however  government demand is unpredictable and there is no guarantee of future contract awards 
as part of the changing economic environment  the united states government has become an important customer for the networking industry  and for us in particular 
the process of becoming a qualified government vendor  especially for high security projects  takes considerable time and effort  and the timing of contract awards and deployment of our products are hard to predict 
typically  six to twelve months may elapse between the initial evaluation of our systems by governmental agencies and the execution of a contract 
the revenue stream from these contracts is hard to predict and may be materially uneven between quarters 
government agency contracts are frequently awarded only after formal competitive bidding processes  which are often protracted and may contain provisions that permit cancellation in the event funds are unavailable to the government agency 
even if we are awarded contracts  substantial delays or cancellations of purchases could result from protests initiated by losing bidders 
in addition  government agencies are subject to budgetary processes and expenditure constraints that could lead to delays or decreased capital expenditures in certain areas 
if we fail to win significant government contract awards  if the government or individual agencies within the government terminate or reduce the scope and value of our existing contracts  or if the government fails to reduce the budget deficit  our financial results may be harmed 
additionally  government orders may be subject to priority requirements that may affect scheduled shipments to our other customers 
because our financial results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly  we may not meet quarterly financial expectations  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
our quarterly revenue and earnings per share guidance is our best estimate at the time we provide guidance 
delays in generating or recognizing forecasted revenues could cause our quarterly operating results to be below our expectations and those of public market analysts or investors  which could cause the price of our common stock to fall 
we may experience a delay in generating or recognizing revenue for a number of reasons 
unfulfilled orders at the beginning of each quarter are typically substantially less than our expected revenue for that quarter 
therefore  we depend on obtaining orders in a quarter for shipment in that quarter to achieve our revenue objectives 
in addition  our reseller agreements typically allow the reseller to delay scheduled delivery dates without penalty 
moreover  demand for our products may fluctuate as a result of seasonality 
for example  sales to the us government are typically stronger in the third calendar quarter and demand from european customers is generally weaker in the summer months 
orders are generally cancelable at any time prior to shipment 
reasons for cancellation could include our inability to deliver products within the customer s specified timeframe due to component shortages or high priority government orders that take precedence to commercial enterprise orders  as well as other reasons 
our revenues for a particular period may also be difficult to predict and may be adversely affected if we experience a non linear back end loaded sales pattern during the period 
we typically experience significantly higher levels of sales towards the end of a period as a result of customers submitting their orders late in the period or as a result of manufacturing issues or component shortages which may delay shipments 
such non linearity in shipments can increase costs  as irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and additional costs associated with higher inventory levels  inventory planning and management 
furthermore  orders received towards the end of the period may not ship within the period due to our manufacturing lead times 
in addition  we may incur increased costs and expenses related to sales and marketing  including expansion of our direct sales operations and distribution channels  product marketing  customer support  expansion of our corporate infrastructure  legal matters  and facilities expansion 
we base our operating expenses on anticipated revenue levels  and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short term 
as a 
table of contents result  any significant shortfall in revenue relative to our expectations could cause a significant decline in our quarterly operating results 
because of the uncertain nature of the economic environment and rapidly changing market we serve  period to period comparisons of operating results may not be meaningful 
in addition  you may not be able to rely on prior results for any period as an indication of future performance 
in the future  our revenue may remain the same  decrease or increase  and we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
as a consequence  operating results for a particular quarter are extremely difficult to predict 
intense competition in the market for network solutions could prevent us from maintaining or increasing revenue and sustaining profitability 
the market for network solutions is intensely competitive 
in particular  cisco systems  inc maintains a dominant position in this market and several of its products compete directly with our products 
cisco s substantial resources and market dominance have enabled it to reduce prices on its products within a short period of time following the introduction of these products  which reduces margins and  therefore  the profitability of its competitors 
purchasers of networking solutions may choose cisco s products because of its longer operating history  broader product line and strong reputation in the networking market 
in addition  cisco may have developed  or could in the future develop  new technologies that directly compete with our products or render our products obsolete 
although we are currently among the top providers of network infrastructure solutions  we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against cisco  currently the leading provider in the networking market 
we also compete with other companies  such as extreme networks  juniper networks  f networks  inc  nortel networks  enterasys networks  com  huawei technologies  force networks  and alcatel 
some of our current and potential competitors have greater market leverage  longer operating histories  greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  more name recognition and larger installed customer bases 
additionally  we may face competition from unknown companies and emerging technologies that may offer new lan  man and lan wan solutions 
furthermore  a number of these competitors may merge or form strategic relationships that would enable them to apply greater resources and sales coverage than we can  and to offer  or bring to market earlier  products that are superior to ours in terms of features  quality  pricing or a combination of these and other factors 
in order to remain competitive  we must  among other things  invest significant resources in developing new products with superior performance at lower prices than our competitors  enhance our current products and maintain customer satisfaction 
in addition  we must make certain our sales and marketing capabilities allow us to compete effectively against our competitors 
if we fail to do so  our products may not compete favorably with those of our competitors and our revenues and profitability could suffer 
we must continue to introduce new products with superior performance and features in a timely manner in order to sustain and increase our revenue  and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers changing needs  our operating results may suffer 
the networking industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements  and evolving industry standards 
therefore  in order to remain competitive  we must introduce new products in a timely manner that offer substantially greater performance and support a greater number of users per device  all at lower price points 
even if these objectives are accomplished  new products may not be successful in the marketplace  or may take more time than anticipated to start generating meaningful revenue 
the process of developing new technology is complex and uncertain  and if we fail to develop or obtain important intellectual property and accurately predict customers changing needs and emerging technological trends  our business could be harmed 
we must commit significant resources to develop new products before knowing whether our investments will eventually result in products the market will accept 
after a product is developed  we must be able to forecast sales volumes and 
table of contents quickly manufacture a sufficient volume of products and mix of configurations that meet customer requirements  all at low costs 
the current life cycle of our products is typically to months 
the introduction of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products or replace sales of some of our current products  thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction  and may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products in anticipation of the new products 
this could harm our operating results by decreasing sales  increasing our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence 
in addition  we have experienced  and may in the future experience  delays in developing and releasing new products and product enhancements and in achieving volume manufacturing for such new products 
this has led to  and may in the future lead to  delayed sales  increased expenses and lower quarterly revenues than anticipated 
during the development of our products  we have also experienced delays in the prototyping of our asics  which in turn has led to delays in product introductions 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property  our business and ability to compete could suffer 
our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent on our internally developed technology and know how 
our proprietary technology includes our asics  our ironcore  jetcore  and terathon hardware architecture  our ironware software  our ironview network management software  and certain mechanical designs 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights in these proprietary technologies 
although we have patent applications pending  there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications  or that claims allowed on any future patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
we provide software to customers under license agreements included in the packaged software 
these agreements are not negotiated with or signed by the licensee  and thus may not be enforceable in some jurisdictions 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights through confidentiality and license agreements  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
these precautions may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property 
monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and the steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of our technology  particularly in some foreign countries in which the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we may be subject to litigation risks and intellectual property infringement claims that are costly to defend and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 
additionally  we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others 
the networking industry is subject to claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
in particular  some companies in the networking industry claim extensive patent portfolios 
as a result of the existence of a large number of patents and rate of issuance of new patents in the networking industry  it is practically impossible for a company to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components may infringe upon intellectual property rights that may be claimed by others 
from time to time third parties have asserted exclusive patent  copyright and trademark rights to technologies and related standards that are important to us 
third parties may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation against us or our manufacturers  suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights with respect to our existing or future products 
we are committed to vigorously defending ourselves against such claims 
regardless of the merits of our position  we have in the past and may in the future incur substantial expenses in defending against third party claims 
in the event of a determination adverse to us  we could incur substantial monetary liability  and be required to change our business practices 
either of these could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
some companies have attempted to realize revenues from their patent portfolios by using licensing programs 
some of these companies have contacted us regarding a license 
we carefully review all license requests  but are unwilling to license technology not required for our product portfolio 
however  any asserted 
table of contents license demand can require considerable effort and expense to review and respond 
moreover  a refusal by us to a license request could result in threats of litigation or actual litigation  which  if initiated  could harm our business 
we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business 
litigation in general  and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular  can be expensive  lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations 
moreover  the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict 
we believe that we have defenses in the lawsuits pending against us as indicated in part i  item legal proceedings  and we are vigorously contesting these allegations 
responding to the allegations has been  and probably will continue to be  expensive and time consuming for us 
an unfavorable resolution of the lawsuits could adversely affect our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
our ability to increase our revenues depends on expanding our direct sales operations and reseller distribution channels and continuing to provide excellent customer support 
if we are unable to effectively develop and retain our sales and support staff  or establish and cultivate relationships with our indirect distribution channels  our ability to grow and increase revenue could be harmed 
additionally  if our resellers and system integrators are not successful in their sales efforts  sales of our products may decrease and our operating results could suffer 
some of our resellers also sell products that compete with our products 
resellers and system integrators typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation  technical support  professional services  and other support services in addition to network equipment sales 
system integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution  and a number of resellers and service providers are also system integrators 
as a result  we cannot assure you that our resellers will market our products effectively or continue to devote the resources necessary to provide us with adequate sales  marketing and technical support 
additionally  if we do not manage distribution of our products and services effectively  or if our resellers financial conditions or operations weaken  our revenues and gross margins could be adversely affected 
in an effort to gain market share and support our customers  we may need to expand our direct sales operations and customer service staff to support new and existing customers 
the timing and extent of any such expansion are uncertain 
we currently outsource our technical support to a third party provider in australia to support our customers in that continent 
in the future  we may utilize third party contractors in other regions of the world as part of our expansion effort 
expansion of our direct sales operations  reseller channels  and customer service operations may not be successfully implemented and the cost of any expansion may exceed the revenues generated 
our gross margins may decline over time and the average selling prices of our products may decrease as a result of competitive pressures and other factors 
our industry has experienced erosion of average product selling prices due to a number of factors  particularly competitive and macroeconomic pressures and rapid technological change 
the average selling prices of our products have decreased in the past and may continue to decrease in response to competitive pressures  increased sales discounts  new product introductions by our competitors or other factors 
both we and our competitors occasionally lower sales prices in order to gain market share or create more demand 
furthermore  as a result of the recent disruption in the technology sector  coupled with more broad macro economic factors  both we and our competitors may pursue more aggressive pricing strategies in an effort to maintain sales levels 
such intense pricing competition could cause our gross margins to decline and may adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
our gross margins may be adversely affected if we are unable to reduce manufacturing costs and effectively manage our inventory levels 
although management continues to closely monitor inventory levels  declines in demand for our products could result in additional provisions for excess and obsolete inventory 
additionally  our gross margins may be negatively affected by fluctuations in manufacturing volumes  component costs  the mix of product configurations sold and the mix of distribution channels through which our products are sold 
for example  we generally realize higher gross margins on direct sales to an end user 
table of contents than on sales through resellers or to our oems 
as a result  any significant shift in revenues through resellers or to our oems could harm our gross margins 
if product or related warranty costs associated with our products are greater than we have experienced  our gross margins may also be adversely affected 
we need additional qualified personnel to maintain and expand our business 
if we are unable to promptly attract and retain qualified personnel  our business may be harmed 
we believe our future success will depend in large part on our ability to identify  attract and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales and marketing  finance and manufacturing personnel 
competition for these personnel can be intense  especially in the san francisco bay area  and we may experience some difficulty hiring employees in the timeframe we desire  particularly engineering and sales personnel 
volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees  all of whom have been granted stock options 
in order to improve productivity  we have historically used stock options to motivate and retain our employees 
the recent decision by the accounting standard setting body regarding the accounting treatment of stock options as compensation expense could limit our ability to continue to use stock options as an incentive and retention tool 
we may not succeed in identifying  attracting and retaining personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel  the inability to identify  attract or retain qualified personnel in the future  or delays in hiring required personnel  particularly engineers and sales personnel  could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet key objectives  such as timely product introductions 
our success also depends to a significant degree on the continued contributions of our key management  engineering  sales and marketing  finance and manufacturing personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
in particular  we believe that our future success may depend on bobby r 
johnson  jr  president  chief executive officer and chairman of the board 
we do not have employment contracts or key person life insurance for any of our personnel 
our operations in international markets involve inherent risks that we may not be able to control 
as a result  our business may be harmed if we are unable to successfully address these risks 
our success will depend  in part  on increasing international sales and expanding our international operations 
our international sales primarily depend on our resellers  including pervasive networks and spot distribution in europe  mitsui in japan  shanghai gentek and gti in china  and samsung in korea 
the failure of our international resellers to sell our products would limit our ability to sustain and grow our revenue 
in particular  our revenue from japan depends primarily on mitsui s ability to sell our products and on the strength of the japanese economy 
there are a number of additional risks arising from our international business  including potential recessions in economies outside the united states  longer accounts receivable collection cycles  seasonal reductions in business activity  higher costs of doing business in foreign countries  infringement claims on foreign patents  copyrights  or trademark rights  difficulties in managing operations across disparate geographic areas  difficulties associated with enforcing agreements through foreign legal systems  political instability and export restrictions  potential adverse tax consequences  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  
table of contents military conflict and terrorist activities  and natural disasters and widespread medical epidemics  such as sars 
the factors described above could also disrupt our product and component manufacturers and key suppliers located outside of the united states 
one or more of such factors may have a material adverse effect on our future international operations and  consequently  on our business  operating results and financial condition 
generally  our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
as a result  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive on a price basis in international markets 
in the future  we may elect to invoice some of our international customers in local currency  which could subject us to fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the local currency 
see also item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk for a review of certain risks associated with foreign exchange rates 
we purchase several key components for our products from sole sources  if these components are not available  our revenues may be harmed 
we purchase several key components used in our products from sole sources  and depend on supply from these sources to meet our needs 
the inability of any supplier to provide us with an adequate supply of key components  or the loss of any of our suppliers  may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders and may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
lead times for various components have lengthened recently as a result of limits on it spending and the economic uncertainty  which has made certain components scarce 
as component demand increases and lead times become longer  our suppliers may increase component costs 
if component costs increase  our gross margins may also decline 
our principal limited or sole sourced components include high speed dynamic and static random access memories  commonly known as drams and srams  asics  printed circuit boards  optical components  packet processors  switching fabrics  microprocessors and power supplies 
we acquire these components through purchase orders and have no long term commitments regarding supply or pricing from these suppliers 
from time to time  we have experienced shortages in allocations of components  resulting in delays in filling orders 
we may encounter shortages and delays in obtaining components in the future  which could impede our ability to meet customer orders 
we depend on anticipated product orders to determine our material requirements 
lead times for limited sourced materials and components can be as long as six months  vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  contract terms and demand for a component at a given time 
inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer requirements 
if orders do not match forecasts  or if we do not manage inventory effectively  we may have either excess or insufficient inventory of materials and components  which could negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 
our reliance on third party manufacturing vendors to manufacture our products may cause a delay in our ability to fill orders 
we subcontract substantially all of our manufacturing to companies that assemble and test our products 
in addition  some foundry branded products are manufactured by third party oems 
our agreements with some of these companies allow them to procure long lead time component inventory on our behalf based on a rolling production forecast provided by us 
we may be contractually obligated to purchase long lead time component inventory procured by certain suppliers and third party manufacturers in accordance with our forecasts although we can generally give notice of order cancellation at least days prior to the delivery date 
if actual demand for our products is below our projections  we may have excess inventory as a result of our purchase commitments 
we do not have long term contracts with these suppliers and third party manufacturers 

table of contents we have experienced delays in product shipments from our contract manufacturers  which in turn delayed product shipments to our customers 
in addition  certain of our products require a long manufacturing lead time  which may result in delayed shipments 
we may in the future experience similar delays or other problems  such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product  any of which could harm our business and operating results 
we intend to regularly introduce new products and product enhancements  which will require us to rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating our efforts with our suppliers and contract manufacturers 
we attempt to increase our material purchases  contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality functions to meet anticipated demand 
the inability of our contract manufacturers or oems to provide us with adequate supplies of high quality products  the loss of any of our third party manufacturers  or the inability to obtain components and raw materials  could cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders 
additionally  from time to time  we transition  via our contract manufacturers  to different manufacturing locations  including lower cost foreign countries 
such transitions are inherently risky and could cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders or a deterioration in product quality 
due to the lengthy sales cycles of some of our products  the timing of our revenue is difficult to predict and may cause us to fail to meet our revenue expectations 
some of our products have a relatively high sales price  and often represent a significant and strategic decision by a customer 
the decision by customers to purchase our products is often based on their internal budgets and procedures involving rigorous evaluation  testing  implementation and acceptance of new technologies 
as a result  our sales cycle in these situations can be as long as months and may vary substantially from customer to customer 
while our customers are evaluating our products and before they may place an order with us  we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort 
consequently  if sales forecasted from certain customers for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter  we may not meet our revenue expectations 
if we do not adequately manage and evolve our financial reporting and managerial systems and processes  our ability to manage and grow our business may be harmed 
our ability to successfully implement our business plan and comply with regulations requires an effective planning and management process 
we expect that we will need to continue to improve existing  and implement new  operational and financial systems  procedures and controls to manage our business effectively in the future 
any delay in the implementation of  or disruption in the transition to  new or enhanced systems  procedures or controls  could harm our ability to accurately forecast sales demand  manage our supply chain and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 
recent legislation requires us to undertake an annual evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting that may identify internal control weaknesses requiring remediation  which could harm our reputation 
we have recently completed our evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of although our assessment  testing and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of december   our internal controls over financial reporting were effective  we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in future periods 
if our internal controls are found to be ineffective in future periods  our reputation could be harmed 
we may incur additional expenses and commitment of management s time in connection with further evaluations  either of which could materially increase our operating expenses and accordingly reduce our net income 
beginning july   we will be required to record compensation expense for stock options 
as a result  our profitability will be reduced significantly 
fasb has recently issued an accounting standard that will require the fair value of all equity based awards granted to employees be recognized in the statement of operations as compensation expense  beginning in the third quarter of the various methods for determining the fair value of stock options are based on  among other things  the volatility of the underlying stock 
as noted above  our stock price has historically been 
table of contents volatile 
therefore  the adoption of this accounting standard will negatively affect our profitability and may adversely affect our stock price 
such adoption could also limit our ability to continue to use stock options as an incentive and retention tool  which could  in turn  hurt our ability to recruit employees and retain existing employees 
the timing of the adoption of industry standards may negatively affect widespread market acceptance of our products 
our success depends in part on both the adoption of industry standards for new technologies in our market and our products compliance with industry standards 
many technological developments occur prior to the adoption of the related industry standard 
the absence or delay of an industry standard related to a specific technology may prevent market acceptance of products using the technology 
we intend to develop products using new technological advancements and may develop these products prior to the adoption of industry standards related to these technologies 
as a result  we may incur significant expenses and losses due to lack of customer demand  unusable purchased components for these products and the diversion of our engineers from future product development efforts 
further  if the adoption of industry standards moves too quickly  we may develop products that do not comply with a later adopted industry standard  which could hurt our ability to sell these products 
if the industry evolves to new standards  we may not be able to successfully design and manufacture new products in a timely fashion that meet these new standards 
even after industry standards are adopted  the future success of our products depends on widespread market acceptance of their underlying technologies 
at least one networking equipment standards body has reportedly stopped all work on a standard in response to assertions by nortel that it controls the patent rights to certain industry standards 
attempts by third parties to impose licensing fees on industry standards could undermine the adoption of such standards and decrease industry opportunities 
if our products contain undetected software or hardware errors  we could incur significant unexpected expenses and lost sales and be subject to product liability claims 
our products are complex and may contain undetected defects or errors  particularly when first introduced or as new enhancements and versions are released 
despite our testing procedures  these defects and errors may be found after commencement of commercial shipments 
any defects or errors in our products discovered in the future or failures of our customers networks  whether caused by our products or another vendors products  could result in negative customer reactions  product liability claims  negative publicity regarding us and our products  delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products  product returns  lost sales  and unexpected expenses to remedy defects or errors 
we may incur liabilities that are not subject to maximum loss clauses 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into purchase orders  sales contracts  and other similar contractual arrangements relating to the marketing  sale  manufacture  distribution  or use of our products and services 
we may incur liabilities relating to our failure to address certain liabilities or inability to perform certain covenants or obligations under such agreements  or which result from claims and losses arising from certain external events as outlined within the particular contract 
such agreements may not contain  or be subject to  maximum loss clauses  and liabilities arising from them may result in significant adverse changes to our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents our products may not continue to comply with the regulations governing their sale  which may harm our business 
in the united states  our products must comply with various regulations and standards defined by the federal communications commission and underwriters laboratories 
internationally  products that we develop may be required to comply with standards established by telecommunications authorities in various countries  as well as those of certain international bodies 
although we believe our products are currently in compliance with domestic and international standards and regulations in countries in which we currently sell  there can be no assurance that our existing and future product offerings will continue to comply with evolving standards and regulations 
if we fail to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certification  we may not be able to sell our products where these standards or regulations apply  which may prevent us from sustaining our revenues or maintaining profitability 
additionally  future changes in tariffs  or their application  by regulatory agencies could affect the sales of some of our products 
we may engage in acquisitions that could result in the dilution of our stockholders  disrupt our operations  cause us to incur substantial expenses and harm our business if we cannot successfully integrate the acquired business  products  technologies or personnel 
although we focus on internal product development and growth  we may learn of acquisition prospects that would complement our existing business or enhance our technological capabilities 
any acquisition by us could result in large and immediate write offs  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  or amortization expenses related to amortizable intangible assets  any of which could negatively affect our results of operations 
furthermore  acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties  including difficulties in the assimilation of products  operations  personnel and technologies of the acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  disruptions to our operations  including potential difficulties in completing ongoing projects in a timely manner  risks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
although we do not currently have any agreements or plans with respect to any material acquisitions  we may make acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies in the future 
we may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that might be acquired  and our failure to do so could harm our business 
our stock price has been volatile historically  which may make it more difficult to sell shares when needed at attractive prices 
the trading price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  subject to wide fluctuations 
our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors  such as quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts  the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable  speculation in the press or investment community  and news reports relating to trends in our markets 
in addition  the stock market in general  and technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock  regardless of our operating performance 
additionally  volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees  all of whom have been granted stock options 

table of contents anti takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of foundry without further action by the stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock 
we have no present plans to issue shares of preferred stock 
further  certain provisions of our charter documents  including provisions eliminating the ability of stockholders to take action by written consent and limiting the ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of stockholders without giving advance notice  may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of foundry  which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock 
in addition  our charter documents do not permit cumulative voting  which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board of directors 
our operations could be significantly hindered by the occurrence of a natural disaster  terrorist acts or other catastrophic events 
our operations are susceptible to outages due to fire  floods  power loss  power shortages  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events 
in addition  certain of our local and foreign offices  oems  and contract manufacturers are located in areas susceptible to earthquakes and acts of terrorism  which could cause a material disruption in our operations 
for example  we procure critical components from countries such as japan and taiwan  which periodically experience earthquakes and typhoons 
the prospect of such unscheduled interruptions may continue for the foreseeable future and we are unable to predict either their occurrence  duration or cessation 
we do not have multiple site capacity for all of our services in the event of any such occurrence 
despite our implementation of network security measures  our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins  and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems 
we may not carry sufficient insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of any of these events 
any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our exposure to interest rate risk relates to our investment portfolio 
we do not use interest rate swaps in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer or fund 
for liquidity purposes  our investment policy requires that we maintain a minimum of million in money market accounts of suitable credit quality 
our investment portfolio is classified as held to maturity and is recorded at amortized cost  and includes only securities with original maturities of less than two years and with secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
since we hold our investments to maturity  we are exposed to risk in the event an issuer is not able to meet its obligations at maturity 
to mitigate this risk  our investment policy does not allow us to invest more than million with any one issuer 
we do not have any investments denominated in foreign country currencies  and therefore are not subject to foreign currency risk on such investments 
we have performed a hypothetical sensitivity analysis assuming an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points for the entire year  while all other variables remain constant 
a hypothetical basis point decline in interest rates as of december  would reduce our annualized interest income by approximately million 

table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk currently  the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  we have not experienced significant foreign exchange gains and losses to date 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
however  in the event our exposure to foreign currency risk increases  we may choose to hedge those exposures 
for most currencies  we are a net payer of foreign currencies and  therefore  benefit from a stronger us dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker us dollar relative to those foreign currencies 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis as of december  and using a modeling technique that measures the change in fair values arising from a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar  with all other variables held constant 
foreign currency exchange rates used were based on market rates in effect at december  and the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not result in a material loss in the fair values of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities at december  and
