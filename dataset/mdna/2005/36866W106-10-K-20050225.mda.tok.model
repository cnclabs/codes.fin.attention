management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is provided as a supplement to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations 
overview gemstar is a media  entertainment and technology company that develops  licenses  markets and distributes technologies  products and services targeted at the television guidance and home entertainment needs of television viewers worldwide 
our tv guide brand reaches nearly million us households  through tv guide magazine  tv guide channel  tv guide interactive  tv guide online and tv guide on screen 
during  we generated revenue of million compared to million in  recorded a net loss of million compared to million in and had cash flow from operations of million compared to million in 
in we also strengthened our balance sheet by repaying the million outstanding under our revolving credit facility  primarily from funds received in prepaid patent license agreements entered into by our cable and satellite segment 
gemstar businesses our businesses are organized into four groups that also represent our reportable business segments 
the segments are organized along three industry lines  in addition to a segment comprising certain corporate functions and related expenses 
publishing our publishing segment consists of our print and electronic publishing units and web sites including tv guide magazine  as well as tv guide online and the skymall catalog business 
the publishing segment also includes tv guide data solutions  a data collection and distribution business that gathers and distributes program listings and channel lineups 
in the publishing segment generated revenue of million  which represented of our total revenue 
our publishing segment generates revenue primarily through subscription and newsstand sales of tv guide magazine and advertising revenue received by tv guide magazine 
tv guide magazine subscription revenues declined again this past year 
we also continued to invest significantly in subscriber acquisition to offset declining newsstand sales and to reduce our reliance on sponsored sales and arrears copies 
in doing so  our overall contribution per copy declined as we used heavy promotional offers to attract new subscribers 
while we believe these new subscribers will renew and eventually become profitable  depending on the acquisition program under which they joined  this could take several years 
newsstand sales also declined again this year 
with its current mix of television listings and editorial content  we no longer believe tv guide magazine can recapture a competitive position at the newsstand 
we also believe our digest size puts us at a disadvantage to competing standard x magazines such as people and us 
additionally  we have a higher cost structure than these magazines 
we currently publish different editions nationwide to address each local market compared to certain competitors one national edition 
this higher cost structure puts us at a significant competitive disadvantage given the decline in our revenue base 
we are currently reviewing our newsstand strategy 
we still believe tv guide magazine is a viable and valuable product to consumers 
we are actively evaluating enhancements to the magazine s format  content and operations in an effort to increase the magazine s profitability 
in the late spring of  we plan to launch a new weekly publication  inside tv 
this new magazine will target young female tv fans and will reflect the way contemporary women are involved with television as well as report on the latest in entertainment news  style and trends 
the magazine will be full size  four color throughout  and is expected to be sold primarily on newsstands rather than through subscription sales 
we expect to incur a material amount of costs in connection with the launch and ongoing operations of inside tv 
those start up costs include additional staffing  marketing expenses  and costs connected with acquiring distribution space in supermarkets  large retailers and other newsstand outlets 
we believe that inside tv offers an opportunity to compete more effectively against other offerings at newsstand than our current tv guide magazine does 
cable and satellite our cable and satellite segment includes the operations of tv guide channel  tv guide interactive  tvg network and several other smaller related businesses 
in the cable and satellite segment generated million in revenue  which represented of our total revenue 
the cable and satellite segment generates revenue primarily from subscription and advertising fees received by tv guide channel  interactive program guide ipg service and licensing revenue received by tv guide interactive and gaming and licensing fees received by tvg network 

table of contents in  tv guide interactive achieved revenue growth of  which was driven by a increase in domestic cable and satellite subscribers that receive either our ipg or another party s ipg provided under a patent license and for which we are paid 
this growth was driven by recent ipg license agreements with echostar  directv  comcast and time warner 
in we plan to continue to increase the number of subscribers who receive our ipg or another party s ipg provided under a patent license as well as continue working with our mso and dbs partners to develop an ipg advertising platform that is appealing to both our partners and to advertisers 
our ability to provide ipg advertising is generally at the discretion of the mso and dbs providers if they deploy their own ipg or a third party ipg 
the majority of subscribers for which we are paid a license fee are receiving a tv guide branded third party ipg 
our agreements with mso and dbs providers generally require us to share a portion of the advertising revenue we receive from ipg advertising on their systems 
in  our ipg advertising was limited to the same mso partners as in the mso providing us with the majority of our advertising carriage in has notified us that they will no longer carry ipg advertising when they migrate to a tv guide branded third party ipg in the first quarter of in  tv guide channel achieved revenue growth of and subscriber growth  as measured by nielsen households of 
in  we lowered our average subscription rates to lock in long term carriage for the tv guide channel 
due to these long term carriage agreements  future tv guide channel revenue growth will be largely dependent on our ability to grow advertising revenue 
in we plan on leveraging our increased carriage by continuing to invest in new programming and marketing initiatives with an expectation that the additional investments will  in the future  result in increased viewership and advertising revenue 
we believe our advertising revenue should also benefit from the continued strengthening of the advertising market and the migration of advertising spending to cable and satellite channels 
this investment in new programming and marketing initiatives will result in a material increase in programming and marketing costs in in  tvg network achieved revenue growth of on household viewership growth of 
as a result  tvg network s total wagers handled was over million for the first time in our history 
in we expect to continue expanding tvg network s distribution and increase wagering by converting viewers into wagering subscribers 
consumer electronics licensing our ce licensing segment earns revenue from licensing our proprietary technologies and services to the ce manufacturing industry 
in the ce licensing segment generated million in revenue  which represented of our total revenue 
the ce licensing segment licenses video recording technology currently marketed under the vcr plus brand in north america and under other brands in europe and asia  and ipgs marketed under the tv guide on screen brand in north america and under the g guide brand in asia and under the guide plus brand in europe 
in  our ce ipg business achieved revenue growth of 
the majority of this growth was due to a million increase in one time settlements and a million or increase in revenue from incorporating our ipg in ce products 
the roll out of our ipg incorporated in ce products has been slower than we anticipated for  among other reasons  the long lead times manufacturers need to incorporate our ipg into their products 
this has  however  had the unexpected benefit of continuing the life cycle for our vcr plus business by a greater than expected incorporation of this technology into digital recorders 
albeit further off in the future than previously anticipated  we still expect success for our ipg with manufacturers of mid range to high end digital televisions  dvrs and dvd recorders  as consumers demand more advanced guidance and recording technologies in such devices 
this business is dependent upon the anticipated consumer demand for such devices materializing 
in  our vcr plus business achieved revenue growth of 
the anticipated impact from the decline in vcr shipments has  for now  been offset by manufacturers incorporating our vcr plus technology in lower priced digital devices such as dvrs  dvd recorders  dvd hdd and combination digital analog products 
while sales of our vcr plus technology appear to have stabilized  we still believe that vcr plus revenues are likely to decrease some time in the future as consumers demand more advanced guidance and recording technologies in digital devices and the costs of incorporating such technologies decrease 
we further believe that  at the same time  our ce ipg revenues will increase as a result of these factors and offset the decrease in vcr plus revenues 
in order to encourage the incorporation of our ipg in ce products  we are offering certain large ce manufacturers the opportunity to bundle both our ipg and vcr plus technology at a significant discount beginning with sales reported in fiscal we anticipate this could lead to a decrease in combined ipg and vcr plus revenues in fiscal  however  we believe this will ultimately accelerate the incorporation of our ipg to our benefit 
corporate our corporate segment comprises various centralized functions  including corporate management  corporate legal  corporate finance and other functions related to costs such as litigation and insurance costs 
in  corporate expenses were million  a decline from the prior year 
the decline in corporate expenses was primarily due to a million decline in legal settlement costs in  primarily due to the million charge recorded in relating to the settlement of the consolidated shareholder class action and the sec investigation 

table of contents recent developments we are currently in settlement and cross licensing discussions with scientific atlanta  inc to resolve outstanding litigation between our two companies 
there can be no assurance that a settlement will be reached or on the specific terms of any settlement 
however  based on the discussions to date  we do not anticipate that any settlement payment that we may receive would have a material impact on our operating results or financial condition 
in the absence of such a settlement  our legal expenses are not likely to be significantly lower than last year 
in any event  we anticipate that our legal expenses  while lower than last year  will continue to be significant

segment activities are discussed in greater detail in the segment results of operations  elsewhere in this md a 
for the year ended december   operating expenses  excluding the impact of the gemstar ebook lease settlement described below  were million  a decrease of million  or  compared to the same period in the largest contributor to this decrease was a million or decline in legal settlement costs 
the decline in legal settlement costs was primarily due to the million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of relating to the consolidated shareholder class action settlement agreement 
the decrease in operating expenses was also due to million in costs incurred in the prior year to improve editorial content and enhance marketing efforts for tv guide magazine 
similar expenses were not incurred in additionally  there was an million reduction in expenses relating to our significantly scaled back gemstar ebook business 

table of contents lease settlement on june   we settled all obligations related to the premises previously occupied by our gemstar ebook operations 
when these premises were vacated during the year ended december   we reserved million to provide for the estimated net present value of future lease obligations 
we paid the landlord million as a full settlement of all remaining lease obligations 
we recognized the reversal of the remaining reserve of million in operating expenses during the second quarter of this item is presented as a separate line item in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
stock compensation stock compensation for consists of amortization of the portion of the purchase price of acquired businesses assigned to unearned compensation for unvested stock options we assumed in the acquisition of tv guide  inc tv guide and the fair value of restricted stock units awarded to certain members of our board of directors 
the unearned compensation is being amortized over the remaining vesting period of the options using an accelerated method 
for the year ended december   stock compensation included million related to stock options held by dr 
yuen and ms 
leung 
as described more fully in note  we terminated the former executives employment for cause on april  in  the executives entered into employment agreements that provided for accelerated vesting of options granted in the period to  as well as an extended post employment exercise period to the remaining term of the options 
prior to the agreements  such options were only exercisable during the employment period with a limited post employment exercise period 
due to the extension of the post employment exercise period  a new measurement date occurred  at which time the intrinsic value of the modification was determined to be million 
the intrinsic value was computed as the difference between the exercise price per share and the stock price per share on the new measurement date multiplied by the number of options 
compensation expense was recognized only when we determined that these executives benefited from the extension of the post employment exercise period 
as a result of the termination  we recognized a pre tax stock compensation charge of million during the first quarter of in addition  stock compensation for the year ended december   included million recognized for amortization of unearned compensation related to unvested stock options we assumed in the acquisition of tv guide  and a net reversal of million related to previously amortized unearned compensation million recognized in the first quarter of and subsequently reversed in the second quarter of  and million recognized in 
the reversal related to restricted stock that was to be issued to dr 
yuen and ms 
leung in connection with the management restructuring in the fourth quarter of the previously recorded expense was reversed in the second quarter of  since these executives were terminated in april and the restricted stock will not be issued 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december   depreciation and amortization was million  a decrease of million  or  compared to the same period in the substantial year over year reduction is due to decreased amortization expense related to certain finite lived intangible assets 
these finite lived intangible assets  which generated million of amortization expense for the year ended december   became fully amortized in july and therefore had no amortization in impairment of intangible assets impairment of intangible assets for the year ended december  was million 
despite spending approximately million in the tv guide magazine business  primarily in the third and fourth quarters of  to improve editorial content and enhance marketing efforts with the hope of stabilizing paid circulation and increasing advertising revenues at the magazine  we were unable to reverse the continuing declines in newsstand sales  subscription revenues and advertising sales 
while we still believe tv guide magazine is a viable and valuable product to consumers  it became apparent during our annual budgeting process  which coincided with the preparation and review of our interim financial statements for the quarter ended september   that we needed to reassess our outlook for the tv guide magazine business 
this triggered an interim assessment of the fair value of tv guide magazine s goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
with the assistance of a third party valuation expert  we estimated the fair values of these indefinite lived intangible assets as of september  as a result  we recorded an impairment charge representing the write off of the remaining goodwill million and publishing rights and trademarks million 
impairment of intangible assets for the year ended december  was million 
the impairment primarily included the write down of the carrying amount of goodwill at tv guide magazine million and the write down of tv guide magazine s publishing rights and trademark million 
these impairments were recorded as part of our annual 
table of contents impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of october  the primary cause of these impairment charges was management s reassessment of the outlook for the magazine as compared to its forecasts and expectations in interest income expense  net for the year ended december   net interest income was million  compared to million of net interest expense for the same period in the change is attributable to a combination of the payoff of tv guide s credit facility on april   and interest income earned on our higher cash balances 
other income  net for the year ended december   other income  net was million  a million increase compared to the same period in the increases in other income  net was primarily due to a million gain on the sale of our equity investment in youbet 
com  inc during the third quarter of gains on sales of marketable securities for the year ended december  were million 
legal and other loss contingencies a significant amount of management estimation is required in determining when  or if  an accrual should be recorded for a contingent matter and the amount of such accrual  if any 
due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event  it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingent matter  a charge could be recorded in a future period that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
liabilities related to contingent matters at december  and december  were million and million  respectively 
the decline in accrued liabilities for contingent matters is primarily due to us paying million in connection with the consolidated shareholder class action settlement and million in connection with the sec settlement  which are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
outside legal expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we expect outside legal expenses to decline  however  we continue to expect outside legal expenses to be significant for the foreseeable future 
income taxes we have income both from foreign and domestic sources 
in the preparation of our financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including estimating both our actual current tax exposure and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the overall effective tax rate we report in any single period is impacted by  among other things  the country in which earnings or losses arise  applicable statutory tax rates and withholding tax requirements for particular countries  the availability of net operating loss carryforwards and the availability of tax credits for taxes paid in certain jurisdictions 
because of these factors  our current and future tax expense or benefit as a percentage of income or loss before income taxes may vary from period to period 
our effective tax benefit rate on loss from continuing operations before income taxes was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as described in impairment of intangible assets above  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write off the remaining goodwill of tv guide magazine 
this impairment charge is not deductible for tax purposes 
in  we also reduced our deferred tax asset valuation allowance by million  primarily due to the tax effect of current year capital losses that will be carried back to offset prior year capital gains and increased our tax reserves by million  as described below 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december   was primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance due to uncertainty of whether or not we will realize the benefit associated with our deferred tax assets and the non deductibility of goodwill impairment write offs 
at december  we had available net operating loss carryforwards aggregating approximately million to offset future united states income taxes expiring in fiscal years through as a result of previous transactions  which involved an ownership change as defined in the applicable section of the internal revenue code  we will be subject to an annual limitation of million on the use of million of these net operating loss carryforwards 
the remaining million of net operating losses are also subject to limitations 
to the extent that we have deferred tax assets  we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from taxable temporary differences  tax strategies or future taxable income and to 
table of contents the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
as of december  and  we have established valuation allowances of million and million  respectively  against our deferred tax assets 
in the future  we may adjust our estimates of the amount of valuation allowance needed and such adjustment would impact our provision for income taxes in the period of such change 
assessment of the company s current tax exposure includes assessing tax strategies  the status of tax audits and open audit periods with the taxing authorities 
the irs is currently examining the company s us federal tax returns for years and in  the company increased reserves primarily to reflect adjustments proposed by the irs 
the ultimate resolution of the company s current tax exposure items may result in the recognition of significant amounts of income or significant cash outlays in future periods 
we believe that adequate reserves have been made for any adjustment that might be assessed for open years 
discontinued operations in march  we entered into various agreements with echostar communications corporation and or certain of its subsidiaries echostar to sell substantially all of the operating assets of the superstar netlink group llc sng  uvtv distribution services  and spacecom systems spacecom businesses collectively  the sng businesses for approximately million in cash 
in addition  echostar agreed to assume certain liabilities 
the sng and uvtv distribution services sales closed on april  the spacecom sale closed on july  accordingly  the sng businesses  previously reported as part of the cable and satellite segment  are shown as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
for the year ended december   pre tax income from discontinued operations was million  an increase of million and compared to the same period of the increase is primarily due to million of impairment charges recorded in relating to the company s sng c band business that were not recorded in the effect of the impairment charge was offset by the closing of the sng and uvtv businesses at the beginning of the second quarter and the closing of the spacecom sale early in the third quarter of additionally  a million pre tax loss on disposal of discontinued operations was recognized in connection with the sale of the sng businesses to echostar

this impairment charge included a billion impairment charge to finite lived intangible and impairment charges of billion and million to goodwill and trademark  respectively  based on analyses performed as of june  and october  impairment charges in were principally the result of then new management s change in strategy for the us cable and satellite ipg business  slower than expected growth in distribution and advertising revenue  and unexpected adverse rulings in certain legal cases

table of contents tv guide magazine revenues  despite a stable circulation base of approximately million  continue to decline 
for the year ended december   tv guide magazine revenues decreased by million  or  compared to the same period in as a result of the continuing decline in this business  we reassessed the carrying value of the goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets associated with tv guide magazine see impairment of intangible assets above 
while tv guide magazine s average weekly individually paid subscribers increased by from a year ago  individually paid subscriber revenues declined million  or  compared to last year 
this was the result of an aggressive subscription acquisition program begun in december  which decreased subscription revenue per copy by as tv guide magazine focused on increasing its base of individually paid subscribers through various promotional offers 
while we believe a significant percentage of these new subscribers will renew at higher rates over time  thus providing an increased per copy contribution  there is no guarantee they will ultimately become profitable 
additionally  depending on the acquisition program under which they joined  it could take several years for an individual subscriber to become profitable 
the focus on increasing individually paid subscribers has been to both offset the continuing decline in sales at newsstand  as well as to reduce the percentage of our million circulation base comprised of sponsored sales and arrears copies 
the latter is important as sponsored sales and arrears copies do not have the potential to provide a greater contribution per copy in the future 
while average sponsored arrears copies for versus decreased by million or  our fourth quarter sponsored arrears copies were flat year on year at million copies 
reducing the percentage of our circulation base comprised of sponsored sales and arrears copies  while maintaining our circulation base  continues to be a focus for us 
subscription revenues for last year also included million from the now discontinued monthly cable magazine 
newsstand revenues of the weekly tv guide magazine decreased by million  or  primarily due to a decrease in copies sold in  compared to the resulting sales decline of million was partially offset by million in additional revenues mainly due to an increase in the newsstand price from to 
while we have a small core of committed newsstand customers  we now believe that our current product offering must be made more compelling at newsstand 
covers and content must be more topical  entertaining  and appealing 
we also believe our digest size puts us at a disadvantage to standard x magazines such as people and us 
as such  we are reassessing our approach to newsstand sales 
in the late spring of  we plan to launch a new weekly publication  inside tv 
this new magazine will target young female tv fans and will reflect the way contemporary women are involved with television as well as report on the latest in entertainment news  style and trends 
the magazine will be full size  four color throughout  and is expected to be sold primarily on newsstands rather than through subscription sales 
we expect to incur a material amount of costs in connection with the launch and ongoing operations of inside tv 
those start up costs include additional staffing  marketing expenses  and costs connected with acquiring distribution space in supermarkets  large retailers and other newsstand outlets 
we believe that inside tv offers an opportunity to compete more effectively against other offerings at newsstand than our current tv guide magazine does 
advertising revenues decreased by million  or  compared to this was due to reduced spending on program promotion by major networks and cable programmers of approximately million 
this was partially offset by an increase in conventional advertising spending in our feature section of the magazine 
new conventional advertisers this year include milano cookies  red roof inns and la quinta 
we also saw a significant increase in advertising from dell computers 
this year  for the first time in the magazine s history  conventional advertisers surpassed program promotion advertisers as the primary source of tv guide magazine advertising revenue 
as network television viewership has declined  we have seen a more limited and focused approach to their marketing spend 
with no apparent return to their previous viewership levels  we are concerned that this decline may be permanent 
skymall s net revenues are comprised of commissions received on the sale of merchandise sold in its in flight catalogs or on its www 
skymall 
com web site  the selling price of merchandise sold through loyalty programs  and placement fees paid by participating merchants to include their products in skymall s catalog 
for the year ended december   revenues increased by million  or  compared to  primarily due to a million increase in placement fees 
tv guide online derives revenues primarily from advertising 
for the year ended december   revenues increased by million  or  compared to these year over year revenue increases were driven by a million or increase in advertising revenues facilitated by increased traffic and advertising inventory 
during  tv guide online underwent a significant redesign  becoming more integrated with the company s other branded products and services  principally tv guide magazine 
since its redesign  tvguide 
com has also been a meaningful source for new subscription orders for tv guide magazine 
other revenues for primarily include the operations of gemstar ebook 
in june  we announced that we would scale back and eventually shut down operations of our gemstar ebook subsidiaries  and as a result  did not record any significant revenues or expenses in we anticipate this business will be completely shut down by summer of 
table of contents as described earlier in consolidated results of operations  on june   we settled our lease obligations for the premises previously occupied by our gemstar ebook operations 
as a result  we recorded the one time reversal of the remaining lease reserve of million as a reduction of operating expenses in this segment 
operating expenses in this segment  exclusive of the gemstar ebook lease settlement  were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  from the same period last year 
the year over year decrease in operating expenses for  was primarily due to a reduction in tv guide magazine expenses of million and ebook business expenses of million 
the net reduction in tv guide magazine expenses was primarily due to the absence of relaunch expenses of million incurred in  reduced compensation expenses of million  and reduced production costs of million primarily due to the discontinuation of the monthly cable guide and lower paper rates 
additional publishing segment operating statistics in thousands tv guide magazine circulation newsstand subscriptions sponsored arrears skymall annual enplanements average weekly circulation for the year 
current period numbers include an estimate for returns 
prior period numbers are restated to reflect actual returns 
enplanements represent an estimate of the number of passengers on all flights carrying the skymall catalog 
fluctuations in this measure have a strong correlation with the volume of catalog orders 
prior period estimate has been adjusted to reflect the most recent reported information

rate increases  related to the tv guide channel s expanded distribution  led to a million increase in infomercial revenues 
focused selling efforts on the program promotion category and the positive impact the olympics had on the conventional advertising revenues drove the remaining increase 
we believe our advertising revenues will continue to grow as a result of the strengthening advertising market and the migration of advertising spending to cable and satellite channels 
advertising revenues are also expected to benefit from our efforts to increase ratings by improving the quality of our programming and supplementing the programming with interactivity 
subscriber and licensing revenues  despite increased carriage  remained flat  as we reduced our subscription rates in order to lock in long term carriage for the tv guide channel 
future tv guide channel revenue growth will be largely dependent on our ability to grow advertising revenues 
we believe that the increased carriage resulting from our long term agreements and 
table of contents improved programming will contribute to future advertising revenue growth 
we also believe improved programming content will drive an increase in tv guide channel ratings  further fostering advertising revenue growth 
the most significant contributor to the increased cable and satellite segment revenues for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  was tv guide interactive 
tv guide interactive revenues increased by million  or  when compared to the same period in the increase is primarily attributable to recent technology licenses with the two largest msos  comcast and time warner cable  and the two major dbs providers  directv and echostar 
additionally  ipg advertising revenues increased by million  or  compared to the same period in our ability to provide ipg advertising is generally at the discretion of the mso and dbs providers if they deploy their own ipg or a third party ipg 
the majority of subscribers for which we are paid a license fee are receiving a tv guide branded third party ipg 
while we believe our advertising proposition is compelling  and that some of our new mso and dbs partners will accept advertising on their ipg in the future  our paid advertising in was limited to the same mso partners as in additionally  the mso providing us with the majority of our advertising carriage  has notified us that they will no longer carry ipg advertising when they migrate to a tv guide branded third party ipg in the first quarter of our ability to significantly increase advertising revenue in future periods is largely dependent on the development of an ipg advertising platform that is accepted by both mso and dbs providers and advertisers 
for the year ended december   tvg network  our interactive cable and satellite television network focused on horse racing  increased revenues by million  or  compared to the same period in this growth reflects increased wagering volumes  in part  due to expanded distribution and the resulting growth in customers 
as of december   tvg network was available in approximately million domestic satellite and cable homes  an increase of from december  additionally  tvg network is carried on fox sports net in approximately million southern california homes for two hours or more five days a week 
operating expenses in this segment were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from the same period last year 
the increased operating expenses were due to increased compensation costs as well as increased production and advertising spend associated with the joan and melissa rivers red carpet events 
we anticipate a meaningful increase in operating costs going forward  primarily due to increased programming and marketing spend at tv guide channel and the launch of an on demand  cross platform  short form entertainment television network in additional cable and satellite segment operating statistics as of as of subscriber data in thousands tv guide channel tv guide channel international tv guide interactive international tvg network cable and satellite technology licenses subscriber data represents nielsen households for tv guide channel subscribers for tv guide channel international and tv guide interactive international are based primarily on information provided by distributors households for tvg network are based primarily on information provided by distributors cable and satellite technology licenses represent domestic cable and satellite subscribers that receive either our ipg or another party s ipg provided under a patent license for which we are paid ce licensing segment for the year ended december   revenues in this segment were million  an increase of million  or  compared to the same period in of the total revenue in ce licensing in and  million and million  respectively  were due to one time settlements 

table of contents the following table shows the breakdown of revenues in the ce licensing segment by product in thousands year ended december  change dollars percent ce licensing segment vcr plus ce ipg dbs other total our vcr plus business includes technology  marketed under the vcr plus brand in north america  the g code brand in asia and the video plus showview brand in europe  that is incorporated in ce products 
for the year ended december   revenues increased by million  or compared to the same period in our anticipated decline in vcr shipments has  for now  been offset by manufacturers incorporating our vcr plus technology in lower priced digital devices such as dvrs  dvd recorders  dvd hdd and combination digital analog products 
while sales of our vcr plus technology appear to have stabilized  we still believe that vcr plus revenues are likely to decrease some time in the future as consumers demand more advanced guidance and recording technologies in digital devices and the costs of incorporating such technologies decrease 
we further believe that  at the same time  our ce ipg revenues will increase as a result of these factors and offset the decrease in vcr plus revenues 
our ce ipg business includes i our ipg incorporated in ce products under the tv guide on screen brand in north america  g guide brand in asia  and guide plus brand in europe  and ii ipg patent licenses with third parties other than our cable and satellite licensees 
revenues from our ipgs incorporated in ce products for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  compared to the same period in contributing to this increase are one time settlements of million  compared to a million in settlements for the same period last year 
excluding these one time settlements  the majority of the ipg patent license revenues reported in our ce ipg business continue to be from the amortization of up front payments received under long term patent licenses  million for the years ending december  and recurring revenues from our ipg incorporated into ce products increased by million or 
this increase was primarily driven by incorporation of our ipg in ce products sold in asia 
we have yet to see any meaningful revenue from our ipg incorporated in ce products sold in europe 
the roll out of our ipg incorporated in ce products has been slower than we anticipated for  among other reasons  the long lead times manufacturers need to incorporate our ipg into their products 
this has  however  had the unexpected benefit of continuing the life cycle for our vcr plus business by a greater than expected incorporation of this technology into digital recorders 
albeit further off in the future than previously anticipated  we still expect success for our ipg with manufacturers of mid range to high end digital televisions  dvrs and dvd recorders  as consumers demand more advanced guidance and recording technologies in such devices 
in order to encourage the incorporation of our ipg in ce products  we are offering certain large ce manufacturers the right to bundle both our ipg and vcr plus technology at a significant discount beginning with sales reported in fiscal we anticipate this could lead to a decrease in combined ipg and vcr plus revenues in fiscal  however  we believe this will ultimately accelerate the incorporation of our ipg to our benefit 
this business is dependent upon the anticipated consumer demand for such devices materializing 
license fees from dbs set top box suppliers for the year ended december  decreased by million compared to the same period in as a result of our agreement with directv  dbs revenues are no longer collected from ce manufacturers of directv s set top boxes  but instead are paid by directv  and thus reported in our cable and satellite segment  on a recurring revenue model based initially on new subscribers 
as such  we no longer anticipate recognizing significant dbs revenues in the ce licensing segment 
for the year ended december   operating expenses in this segment were million  an increase of million  or  when compared to the same period in we recognized million in net bad debt recovery in the comparable period a year ago 
the absence of a comparable bad debt recovery in the current period was the primary contributor to this increase 
corporate segment for the year ended december   operating expenses in this segment were million a decrease of million  or  when compared to the same period in the decline in corporate expenses was principally due to a million decline in legal settlement costs in  primarily due to the million charge recorded in relating to the settlement of the consolidated shareholder class action and the sec investigation 
a reduction in consulting fees and legal expenses also contributed to the decline 
while legal expenses are expected to continue to decline  we anticipate that they will remain significant for the foreseeable future

gemstar ebook revenues decreased by million in  as compared with revenues are earned primarily through licensing of technology and also through the sale of ebook devices and content 
the decline in revenue was primarily due to a decrease in the sale of ebook content in connection with the shutdown of the ebook operations

of the million of revenue recognized in  million was related to prior service periods 
operating expenses in this segment were million for  a decrease of million  or  when compared to the decrease in segment expenses for over the corresponding prior year period was primarily due to a million decrease in bad debt expense due to the recovery in of amounts reserved in the prior year and due to decreases in various other general and administrative expenses 
corporate segment the corporate segment comprises various centralized functions  including corporate management  corporate legal  corporate finance and other functions  and related costs such as certain litigation and insurance costs

such increases were offset by termination fees totaling million that were expensed in associated with the november management and corporate governance restructuring and a million decrease in audit fees during compared with in  we recorded a loss contingency of million related to a settlement with the department of justice and severance costs of million associated with the separation of a former executive

these upfront license fees  less certain adjustments  were recorded as deferred revenue  and will be recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the terms of the license agreements 
we do not anticipate receiving similar one time upfront license payments in further  as a result of these up front license fee payments a meaningful amount of the tv guide interactive revenue in our cable and satellite segment will represent the amortization of this deferred revenue and not cash payments

the following is a summary of our future minimum payments under certain contractual obligations as of december  in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years capital leases operating leases purchase obligations jv funding obligations total critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying certain critical accounting policies 
certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to our consolidated financial statements and because of the 
table of contents possibility that future events affecting the estimates could differ markedly from our current expectations 
we believe that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that affect our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition general we have followed the guidance of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  since its effective date of december  and emerging issues task force eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  since its effective date of june for revenue recognition  and analogize to the guidance in statement of position  software revenue recognition sop 
previously  we followed sop and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
under this guidance  four conditions must be met before revenue can be recognized i there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  iii the price is fixed or determinable and iv collection is reasonably assured 
license fees we license our proprietary technologies to ce manufacturers and to service providers  including msos and other owners and operators of cable television systems  telephone networks  internet service providers  internet web sites  direct to home broadcast satellite service providers  wireless systems and other multi channel video programming distributors 
it is our normal practice to enter into written agreements with our customers 
we generally recognize such license fees based on a per unit shipped model with consumer electronics manufacturers or a per subscriber model with service providers 
our revenues from per unit license fees are recognized in the period the manufacturers report the number of units shipped 
revenues from per subscriber fees are recognized in the period services are provided by a licensee  as reported to us by the licensee 
under certain agreements  manufacturers prepay license fees for a guaranteed minimum number of unit shipments over a specified period 
revenues are recognized when the manufacturers report the number of units shipped 
if any portion of the prepayment remains to be recognized as revenue at the end of the period  it is recorded as revenue in the final month of the period 
fees for shipments in excess of the minimum are recognized in the period the manufacturers report the units shipped 
see multiple element arrangements below 
revenues from annual and other license fees generally are recognized based on the specific terms of the license agreements 
for instance  we entered into certain arrangements under which substantial flat fees were paid upfront in addition to ongoing per unit license fees 
in such cases  the prepaid fees were deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement 
in certain cases  we will license our technology for an unlimited number of units over a specified period of time during which we have continuing obligations 
we record the fees associated with these arrangements on a straight line basis over the specified term 
in addition  we have licensing arrangements with msos under which we share a portion of the ipg advertising revenue that we generate through the mso 
in some cases  we guarantee that a substantial portion of the mso s license fees paid to us will be reimbursed to the mso through our ad sharing obligation 
to the extent the ad sharing fees are not sufficient to meet these guarantees  we are obligated to purchase advertising on the mso s platform 
because the license fee is not fixed or determinable until resolution of the sharing or advertising buyback  which is typically settled quarterly  the advertising buyback guarantees and advertising revenue sharing are netted against the license fees so that only a net license fee amount is recognized 
from time to time  the license agreement between a licensee and us may expire 
while a new license agreement is being negotiated  the licensee may continue to ship the same units or the same services may continue to be deployed containing our patented or proprietary technologies and the licensee may continue to report units shipped or subscriber information on a periodic basis 
license and subscriber fees may continue to be received at the old contract rates and on a timely basis 
in such cases  we continue to recognize license and subscriber fee revenue 
however  revenue is not recognized when collection is not reasonably assured and in no case when payment is not received for greater than days 
multiple element arrangements in accounting for multiple element arrangements  one of the key judgments to be made is the accounting value that is attributable to the different contractual elements 
the appropriate allocation of value not only impacts which segment is credited with the revenue  it also impacts the amount and timing of revenue recorded in the consolidated statement of operations during a given period due to the differing methods of recognizing revenue by each of the segments  as discussed above 
revenue is allocated to each element based on the accounting determination of the relative fair value of that element to the aggregate fair value of all elements 
the fair values must be reliable  verifiable and objectively determinable 
when available  such determination is based principally on the pricing of similar cash arrangements with unrelated parties that are not part of a multiple element arrangement 
when sufficient evidence of the fair values of the individual elements does not exist  revenue is not allocated among them until that evidence exists 
instead  the revenue is recognized as earned using revenue recognition 
table of contents principles applicable to the entire arrangement as if it were a single element arrangement 
at this time  in all instances where ipg advertising has been part of a multiple element transaction  no revenue has been allocated to ipg advertising for accounting purposes  and all revenue has been allocated to other elements of the transaction 
for accounting purposes  we expect to record ipg advertising associated with multiple element arrangements in this manner until such time as we conclude that we can determine the fair value of ipg advertising in a reliable  verifiable and objective manner 
impairment of long lived assets  long lived assets to be disposed of and intangible assets we review our long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the value of our intangible assets  including goodwill  is exposed to future adverse changes if we experience declines in operating results or experience significant negative industry or economic trends or if future performance is below historical trends 
we periodically review intangible assets and goodwill for impairment using the guidance of applicable accounting literature 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the undiscounted future operating cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
we have a significant amount of property and equipment and intangible assets 
the determination as to whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable involves management s judgment 
in addition  should we conclude that recoverability of an asset is in question  the estimate of undiscounted future operating cash flows is used to determine whether an asset is recoverable and  if not  the final determination of the fair value of the asset is also based on the judgment of management 
these judgments can be impacted by a variety of underlying assumptions  such as the general business climate  effectiveness of competition and supply and cost of resources 
accordingly  actual results can differ significantly from the assumptions made by management in making its estimates 
future changes in management s estimates could result in indicators of impairment and actual impairment charges where none exist as of the date of this report 
accounting standards  which became effective january   eliminated the impairment recoverability tests for certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives and require that such assets be valued at the lower of their carrying value or fair value 
goodwill is no longer amortized but remains subject to an annual impairment test performed at the reporting unit level 
fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset under review  discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period 
absent any interim evidence of impairments  we will perform our annual impairment test of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles for all reporting units on october of each year 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record a valuation allowance  if necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
we have income both from foreign and domestic sources 
in the preparation of our financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including estimating both our actual current tax exposure and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
assessment of our actual current tax exposure includes assessing tax strategies  the status of tax audits and open audit periods with the taxing authorities 
the ultimate resolution of our current tax exposure items may result in the recognition of significant amounts of income or significant cash outlays in future periods 
to the extent that we have deferred tax assets  we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from taxable temporary differences  tax strategies or future taxable income and to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
as of december  and  we have established valuation allowances of million and million  respectively  against our deferred tax assets 
in the future  we may adjust our estimates of the amount of valuation allowance needed and such adjustment would impact our provision for income taxes in the period of such change 

table of contents legal and other loss contingencies a significant amount of management estimation is required in determining when  or if  an accrual should be recorded for a contingent matter and the amount of such accrual  if any 
due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event  it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingent matter  a charge could be recorded in a future period that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
as of december  and  we had accrued million and million  respectively  for contingent matters 
allowance for doubtful accounts we have significant amounts due to us from our customers 
we continuously evaluate our outstanding accounts receivable for collectibility 
this evaluation involves management s judgment in assessing the aging of the amounts due to us and in reviewing the credit worthiness of each customer 
should a customer s financial condition deteriorate in a manner that could decrease the customer s ability to pay amounts due to us  we might be required to provide additional allowance for doubtful accounts  which would reduce our earnings

certain risks affecting business  operating results and financial condition this section highlights some specific risks affecting our business  operating results and financial condition 
the list of risks is not intended to be exhaustive and the order in which the risks appear is not intended as an indication of their relative weight or importance 
tv guide magazine  which is a significant business  has experienced significant declines in contribution per copy and operating results and these declines may continue 
we sell tv guide magazine to households and newsstands and customized weekly program guides to customers of cable and satellite service providers 
tv guide magazine has seen circulation contribution per copy decline significantly over the past several years  while many of the costs of producing and distributing the magazine are fixed and therefore have not declined correspondingly 
a significant cause of the decline in circulation contribution per copy has been the decline in high contribution newsstand sales due to increased competition from larger  glossy  entertainment laden publications  free television listings included in local newspapers  ipgs incorporated into digital cable and satellite services  and other sources 
to date  we have not 
table of contents seen a reversal in the decline in our newsstand sales  which are important to tv guide magazine s profitability  and no longer believe the magazine in its present form can recapture its former sales levels at the newsstand 
furthermore  in order to offset declining newsstand sales  reduce our reliance on sponsored sales and arrears copies  and rebuild the subscriber base of tv guide magazine  we have provided subscribers with various forms of promotional offerings low  or no  contribution per copy subscriptions 
while we believe a significant percentage of these new subscribers will renew at higher rates over time  thus providing an increased per copy contribution  there can be no assurance that these promotions will lead participating subscribers to renew their subscriptions at higher rates upon expiration of the promotion period 
additionally  depending on the acquisition program under which an individual subscriber joined  it could take several years for an individual subscriber to become profitable 
there can be no assurance that these subscribers will ultimately become profitable 
declines in tv guide magazine s circulation contribution per copy and operating results may continue and could be significant 
unless the decline in newsstand sales is reversed and unless newly acquired subscribers renew at higher rates  our results will continue to be adversely affected 
continued decline in tv guide magazine program advertising and dependence on conventional advertising could adversely affect our results 
tv guide magazine has experienced a substantial decline in program advertising revenue while conventional advertising replaced program advertising as the largest source of the magazine s advertising revenue 
however  there can be no assurance that the decline in program advertising will not continue or that conventional advertising will offset such decline 
furthermore  the drug industry  which has been one of the largest sources of conventional advertising for the tv guide magazine  may take a more limited approach to its marketing spend which may adversely affect our results 
our launch of inside tv may be unsuccessful and may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
we intend to launch a new magazine called inside tv in the second quarter of generally  new publications require several years to achieve profitability 
we expect that inside tv will not achieve profitability for the next few years 
further  we expect start up costs  principally promotional costs and staffing  to be significant throughout the remainder of inside tv is targeted principally at an audience of women in their s and s 
several other magazines and other media outlets target this market segment  and there can be no assurance that inside tv will appeal to or be accepted by this market segment or the advertisers who seek to reach it 
our launch of the on demand network may be unsuccessful and may adversely affect our results 
we plan on launching an on demand  cross platform television network featuring originally produced sponsored short form video entertainment programs that provide television guidance 
the success of the network is largely dependent on factors such as the extent of distribution of the network as well as market and advertiser acceptance of sponsored short form on demand entertainment 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our initiative or that such initiatives will generate significant revenues 
the market for interactive program guides may not develop rapidly 
the market for ipgs is rapidly evolving and is increasingly competitive 
demand and market acceptance for ipgs are subject to uncertainty and risk 
we cannot predict whether  or how fast  this market will grow  how long it can be sustained  or how it may develop or change 
for our ce ipgs  the deployment rate depends on the strength or weakness of the consumer electronics industry  and in particular  the sale of television sets  dvd recorders and dvrs 
purchases of ce products and digital cable and dbs subscriptions are largely discretionary and may be affected by general economic trends in the countries or regions in which these products or subscriptions are offered 
for tv guide interactive  which is deployed through digital set top boxes  the deployment rate depends on the growth of digital cable and dbs subscribers and our penetration of the market for ipgs for these subscribers 
revenues from the licensing of our ipg technology to cable and satellite service providers will also depend upon the growth of digital cable television subscribers in the systems operated by our licensees 
if the market for our ipgs  and those of our licensees  develops slowly or becomes saturated with competitors  our operating results could be adversely impacted 
the market for ipg advertising may not develop rapidly 
our ability to provide ipg advertising is at the discretion of the mso and dbs providers who have entered into license agreements to deploy their own ipg or a tv guide branded third party ipg 
our ability to increase the revenues that we derive from the sale of advertising on ipgs distributed by our cable and satellite licensees will depend on the implementation of ipg advertising by such licensees  as well as on increased acceptance of ipg advertising by consumers and advertisers 
the market for ipg advertising is at an early stage of development and we cannot assure you that we will succeed in our efforts to develop ipg advertising as a widely accepted advertising medium 
the mso providing us with the majority of our advertising carriage  
table of contents has notified us that they will no longer carry ipg advertising when they migrate to a tv guide branded third party ipg in the first quarter of our business may be adversely affected by fluctuations in demand for consumer electronics devices incorporating our technologies 
we derive significant revenues from manufacturer license fees for our vcr plus and ce ipg technologies based on the number of units shipped 
we do not manufacture hardware  but rather depend on the cooperation of ce manufacturers to incorporate our technology into their products 
generally  our license agreements do not require manufacturers to include our technology in any specific number or percentage of units  and only a few of these agreements guarantee a minimum aggregate licensing fee 
demand for new ce devices  including television sets  integrated satellite receiver decoders  dvrs  dvd recorders  personal computers and internet appliances  may be adversely impacted by increasing market saturation  durability of products in the marketplace  new competing products and alternate consumer entertainment options 
as a result  our future operating results may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in sales of ce devices employing our technologies 
vcr plus revenues have declined over time and may decline further due to full penetration of the product in a declining market 
revenues derived from vcr plus have declined over time and may decline further because virtually all major vcr manufacturers have licensed the vcr plus technology and the fact that we have already expanded into most major markets worldwide 
the worldwide shipment of vcrs is expected to decline as vcrs are replaced by digital recording devices such as dvd recorders and dvrs 
although vcr plus is now being incorporated into some digital recording devices  there is no assurance that this practice will become widespread or continue 
furthermore  in order to encourage the incorporation of our ipg in ce products  we are offering certain large ce manufacturers the opportunity to bundle both our ipg and vcr plus technology at a significant discount beginning with sales reported in fiscal we anticipate this could lead to a decrease in combined ipg and vcr plus revenues in fiscal while we believe this will ultimately accelerate the incorporation of our ipg to our benefit  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew our existing vcr plus agreements as they expire  upon terms as favorable to us as those contained in prior contracts  or at all 
any infringement by us or some of our licensees on patent rights of others could affect the development of our products and services or result in litigation 
patents of third parties may have an important bearing on our ability to offer some of our products and services 
many of our competitors as well as other companies and individuals have obtained  and may be expected to obtain in the future  patents that concern products or services related to the types of products and services we plan to offer 
we may not be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services 
in addition  in the united states  patent applications are generally confidential for a period of months from the filing date  or until a patent is issued in some cases  so we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications prior to their publication 
if one or more of our products or services is found to infringe patents held by others  we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services  to obtain licenses to develop and market the products or services from the holders of the patents or to redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing the patent claims 
we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others and whether the licenses would be available or  if available  whether we would be able to obtain the licenses on commercially reasonable terms 
if we were unable to obtain the licenses  we might not be able to redesign our products or services to avoid infringement 
furthermore  we provide indemnification protection to some of our ce ipg licensees and to some of our service provider licensees under which we may be obligated to indemnify those licensees and hold them harmless from some claims  including claims that our or their products or services infringe other parties patents 
the costs of investigating  defending or remedying alleged infringement could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
some terms of our agreements with licensees could be interpreted in a manner that could adversely affect licensing revenue payable to us under those agreements 
some of our agreements with ce manufacturers and cable and satellite service providers contain most favored nation clauses 
these clauses typically provide that if we enter into an agreement with another licensee on more favorable terms  we must offer some of those terms to our existing licensee 
we have recently entered into a number of license agreements with terms that may differ in some respects from those contained in our prior agreements 
these agreements may obligate us to offer different terms to licensees  which could  if accepted  result in lower revenues or otherwise adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
while we believe that we have appropriately accounted for the most favored nation 
table of contents terms included in our license agreements  these contracts are complex and other parties could reach a different conclusion that  if correct  could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
dependence on the cooperation of mso and dbs providers  television broadcasters  hardware manufacturers  publications and data providers could adversely affect our revenues 
we rely on others to deliver our ce ipg data to ce devices that include our ce ipg 
there can be no assurance that these delivery mechanisms will distribute the data without error or that the agreements that govern some of these relationships can be maintained on favorable economic terms 
to deliver our ce ipg data to ce devices  we have arrangements to carry our data in a part of the television signal called the vertical blanking interval vbi or its digital signal equivalent  of television stations included in the public broadcasting network  independently owned stations  and stations owned and operated by various station group owners 
our contract related to the public broadcasting network stations covers substantially all of the territory required to be covered to effectively transmit our data for delivery to ce devices incorporating our ce ipgs 
we nevertheless continue to rely on arrangements  which are not long term  with station group owners and operators and independently owned stations for vbi carriage of our ipg data 
we cannot assure you that our carriage arrangements with station group owners and operators and independently owned stations will continue 
our data broadcast through the vbi can be  and has been in the past in some markets  deleted or modified by some of the local service providers 
widespread deletion or modification of this data by service providers could have a material adverse impact on our ce ipg business 
to mitigate this risk  we have entered into agreements with many service providers to ensure that our ce ipg data will not be deleted or modified by such systems 
furthermore  in order for consumer electronics devices that incorporate our ce ipgs to receive our data  such data must also be able to pass through any receivers through which such devices are receiving television programming signals 
we do not currently deliver our ce ipg data over satellite networks 
even if our ce ipg data is passed to cable subscribers through cable networks by the service providers  there is a risk that the cable set top boxes deployed by such subscribers can impede the passage of our ce ipg data 
additionally  cable companies are progressively moving their systems from an analog format to a digital format  which poses certain problems to our data carriage 
solving such problems will require the cooperation of third parties such as the mso and dbs providers  television broadcasters and hardware manufacturers  and may also require additional investment by the company 
widespread impedance of our ce ipg data could have a material adverse impact on our ce ipg business 
in addition  we purchase some of our program guide information from commercial vendors 
the quality  accuracy and timeliness of that data may not continue to meet our standards or be acceptable to consumers 
our vcr plus system relies on consumer access to pluscode numbers through licensed publications 
we depend on the maintenance and renewal of agreements governing the pluscode publications to ensure the distribution of the pluscodes 
limitations on control of joint ventures 
the company holds its interests in certain businesses  including guideworks llc and interactive program guide  inc  as a joint venture or in partnership with nonaffiliated third parties 
as a result of such arrangements  the company may be unable to control the operations  strategies and financial decisions of such joint venture or partnership entities which could in turn result in limitations on the company s ability to implement strategies that the company may favor  or to cause dividends or distributions to be paid 
in addition  the company s ability to transfer its interests in businesses owned with third parties is limited under certain joint venture  partnership or similar agreements 
we face risks arising from our tv guide channel strategy 
revenues at tv guide channel consist of affiliate fees and advertising revenues  however  since the majority of our affiliates are contracted under long term agreements with only cost of living increases available under certain contracts  we do not expect significant growth in affiliate revenues in the future 
accordingly  the results at tv guide channel are highly dependent upon advertising revenue 
advertising revenue at the tv guide channel is primarily dependent on the extent of distribution of the network  viewership ratings  such as those published by nielsen  and continuing advertising strength in the marketplace 
while tv guide channel has benefited  to a certain degree  from the expanded distribution that we have achieved  a significant portion of the expanded distribution has been to dbs subscribers  who did not previously have tv guide channel as a programming choice 
to date  the viewership of tv guide channel in dbs homes has been minimal 
we have recently begun investing in new programming and marketing initiatives at the tv guide channel with an expectation that the additional investments that we are making in programming and marketing will  in the future  result in increased viewership in both cable and dbs homes 
if our viewership ratings do not improve or we are unable to maintain broad distribution of the tv guide channel  our increased programming and marketing costs could have a material adverse effect on our cable and satellite segment results of operations 
also  certain of the long term agreements with msos for the tv guide channel allow for the migration to exclusively digital carriage 
if the mso elects to migrate tv guide channel earlier than we currently expect  the company will experience a significant reduction of tv guide channel subscribers resulting in reduced license fee revenue and potentially reduced advertising revenue 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in implementing our new programming and marketing 
table of contents initiatives  or that such initiatives will result in increased viewership ratings and advertising revenues for tv guide channel or that any initial increase in viewership ratings will be sustainable over time 
seasonality and variability of consumer electronics product shipments and newsstand sales of our print products may affect our revenues and results of operations on a quarterly or annual basis 
shipments of ce products tend to be higher in the second and fourth calendar quarters 
we recognize revenues associated with our technology incorporated in these ce products when the shipments are reported to us  generally the third and first calendar quarters 
general advertising also tends to be higher in the fourth quarter 
in addition  manufacturer shipments vary from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors  including retail inventory levels and retail promotional activities 
newsstand sales of our print products tend to be higher in the first and fourth calendar quarters 
as a result  we may experience variability in our licensing and advertising revenues 
paper and postal price increases can materially raise our costs associated with the production and delivery of the tv guide print products  including tv guide magazine and skymall catalog 
the price of paper can be a significant factor affecting tv guide magazine s and skymall s operating performance 
we do not hedge against increases in paper costs 
paper prices are increasing and if we cannot pass these costs on to our customers  the increases may have a material adverse effect on us 
postage for product distribution and direct mail solicitations is also a significant  uncontrollable expense to us 
we face risks related to the ongoing sec enforcement action  securities litigation and doj investigation involving certain of our former executives 
although we have settled with the sec regarding its investigation of the company and we have settled most of the related shareholder and securities litigation filed against the company  some of our former officers and directors have been named as defendants in certain of these matters 
the plaintiff class in the consolidated shareholder class action has retained all of its securities fraud claims against our former chief executive officer and former chief financial officer 
in addition  although all five of the former officers and directors of the company who were named defendants in the pending sec civil action have reached proposed settlements with the los angeles office of the sec  not all of these settlements have received final approval from the sec and the court 
further  the department of justice doj has also been conducting an investigation into allegations raised against some of the company s former officers and directors in the sec investigation and the related shareholder lawsuits 
the company is generally obligated  to the extent permitted by law  to indemnify our former directors and officers who are named defendants in some of these lawsuits and investigations 
in addition  we are generally obligated  to the extent permitted by law  to advance legal defense costs and expenses incurred by those individuals 
our ability to anticipate the timing and amount of those costs and expenses that will be submitted to us for advancement is limited  however  those amounts have been significant and may continue to be significant until these matters are fully resolved 
in addition  the timing of the final resolution of these proceedings is uncertain 
the possible resolutions of these proceedings could include judgments or settlements against our indemnitees that could require substantial payments by us  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
an unfavorable outcome of intellectual property litigation or other legal proceedings may adversely affect our business and operating results 
our results may be affected by the outcome of pending and future litigation and the protection and validity of our patents and other intellectual property rights 
our patents and other intellectual property rights are important competitive tools and many generate income under license agreements 
we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented in the united states or abroad 
furthermore  we are subject to various antitrust claims asserted by third parties in connection with pending intellectual property litigation 
some of these matters involve potential compensatory  punitive or treble damage claims  or sanctions that  if granted  could have a material adverse effect on us 
unfavorable rulings in our legal proceedings  including those described in note  litigation and other contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements  may have a negative impact on us that may be greater or smaller depending on the nature of the rulings 
in addition  we are currently  and from time to time in the future may be  subject to various other claims  investigations  legal and administrative cases and proceedings whether civil or criminal or lawsuits by governmental agencies or private parties 
if the results of these investigations  proceedings or suits are unfavorable to us or if we are unable to successfully defend against third party lawsuits  we may be required to pay monetary damages or may be subject to fines  penalties  injunctions or other censure that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
even if we adequately address the issues raised by an investigation or proceeding or successfully defend a third party lawsuit or counterclaim  we may have to devote significant financial and management resources to address these issues  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 

table of contents we face competition in many areas and the competition could negatively impact our operating results 
we face competition from a wide range of other companies in the communications  advertising  media  entertainment  publishing  information  internet services  software and technology fields 
the competitive environment could  among other results  require price reductions for our products and services  require increased spending on marketing and development  limit our ability to develop new products and services  limit our ability to expand our customer base or even result in attrition in our customer base 
any of these occurrences could negatively impact our operating results 
many of our competitors have greater financial and human resources than we do 
as a result  these competitors can compete more effectively by offering customers better pricing and other terms and conditions  including indemnifying customers against patent infringement claims 
tvg network competes for viewers with other television networks  one of which is under common ownership with several racetracks and accepts wagers from residents of more states than tvg network accepts 
in addition  tvg network and its licensees compete for wagering revenue with other account wagering operations and industry participants 
new products and services and rapid technological change may adversely affect our operations 
the emergence of new consumer entertainment products  services and technologies  changes in consumer preferences and other factors may limit the life cycle of our technologies and any future products and services we might develop 
although we believe that we will continue to develop attractive new products and services  the industry in which we operate is characterized by rapid changes  including technological changes 
our future operations could be adversely impacted by our ability to identify emerging trends in our markets and to develop and market new products and services that respond to competitive offerings  technological changes and changing consumer preferences in a timely manner and at competitive costs 
the process of developing and marketing new products and services is inherently complex and uncertain  and there are a number of risks  including the following we cannot assure you that we will have adequate funding and resources necessary for investments in new products  services and technologies  we cannot assure you that our long term investments and commitment of significant resources will result in successful new products  services or technologies  we cannot assure you that we can anticipate successfully the new products  services and technologies which will gain the market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenues  we cannot assure you that our newly developed products  services or technologies can be successfully protected as proprietary intellectual property rights or will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others  and our products  services and technologies may become obsolete due to rapid advancements in technology and changes in consumer preferences 
furthermore  we have made significant investments in the development of new products  services and technologies  such as our initiatives to increase and enhance the vod functionality of our interactive products  but the success of such products  services and technologies is largely dependent on factors such as data carriage and market acceptance 
our failure to anticipate adequately changes in the industry and the market  and to develop attractive new products and services  including any of the risks described above  may reduce our future growth and profitability and may adversely affect our business results and financial condition 
digital recapture could adversely affect carriage of our analog products and services 
cable television is transmitted on a limited frequency spectrum that must be allocated between multiple analog and digital channels 
as digital penetration increases  msos are reclaiming analog bandwidth to launch more digital networks and interactive television services  and are likely to continue this recapture until they rebuild their plants to increase bandwidth or there is stability in the mix of analog and digital carriage 
if this trend continues  digital recapture may result in a significant decline in the distribution of our analog tv guide channel  which could negatively impact our operating results 
government regulations may adversely affect our business 
the satellite transmission  cable and telecommunications industries are subject to pervasive federal regulation  including fcc licensing and other requirements 
these industries are also often subject to extensive regulation by local and state authorities 
while these regulations do not apply directly to us  they affect cable television providers and other multichannel video programming distributors mvpds  which are the primary customers for our products and services 
in april  the fcc extended to july  a deadline under which mvpds except dbs providers must phase out consumer electronic navigation devices eg  set top boxes with combined security and non security functions 
the fcc has indicated that it may eliminate this 
table of contents separation requirement altogether if the cable and consumer electronics industries successfully negotiate a bi directional plug and play agreement  which would allow interactive services to be provided on digital televisions without the need for a set top box 
a plug and play agreement could affect demand for ipgs incorporated into set top boxes or consumer electronics devices  such as tv guide interactive and our ce ipgs 
future developments relating to any of these or other regulatory matters may adversely affect our business 
the gaming activities of tvg network are extensively regulated 
tvg network derives a substantial portion of its revenue from pari mutuel wagering  which is subject to extensive statutory and regulatory oversight 
adverse changes in the political climate  new legislation or regulatory activity could harm our business 
from time to time  members of congress and state legislatures have introduced bills that would prohibit or severely restrict off track interstate pari mutuel wagering 
in addition  a leading payment system has  on behalf of its member financial institutions  recently taken an interest in limiting the use of credit cards for non face to face gaming transactions as a means of combating illegal internet based gambling operations 
although such efforts to restrict payment mechanisms may not be targeted at the lawful activity of licensed operations such as tvg network  the resulting inconvenience to our customers caused by such measures could harm our business or growth prospects 
continued consolidation of the cable and satellite broadcasting industry could adversely affect existing agreements  the impact of these changes is not clear 
we have entered into agreements with a large number of cable msos and dbs providers for the licensing or distribution of our technology  products and services 
if  as expected  consolidation of the cable and satellite broadcasting industry continues  some of these agreements may be affected by mergers  acquisitions or system swaps 
we cannot assure you that any measures that we have taken to protect us against any negative consequences resulting from those transactions will be effective 
also  a service provider that files a bankruptcy petition or otherwise restructures or liquidates could avoid its future obligations and discharge its past payment obligations under the agreement in some circumstances 
any such events could have a material adverse effect on the amount of revenue we receive under these agreements 
our stock price has been volatile 
the market price of our common stock has historically been volatile 
it is likely that the market price of our common stock will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations 
we believe that future announcements concerning us  our competitors or our principal customers  including technological innovations  new product and service introductions  governmental regulations  litigation or changes in earnings estimated by us or analysts may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially in the future 
sales of substantial amounts of outstanding common stock in the public market could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
further  in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price fluctuations in equity securities of technology and media companies 
these price and volume fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies 
these fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  such as armed hostilities  acts of terrorism  civil disturbances  recessions  international currency fluctuations  or tariffs and other trade barriers  may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we do not have a comprehensive disaster recovery plan or back up system  and a disaster could severely damage our operations 
we currently do not have a comprehensive disaster recovery plan and do not have fully redundant systems for some critical operations 
although we have some technology redundancy and back up capabilities for our production  publishing and transmission capabilities  there are currently single points of failure within our processes and technology that  in the event of a catastrophic disruption  would cause us to lose our ability to provide transmission or publishing capabilities 
in that event  we would have to operate at reduced service levels that could have a material adverse affect on our relationships with our customers  our revenue generation and our brand 
news corporation s interests may diverge from those of other stockholders and the company 
news corporation has significant influence over our business because of its beneficial ownership of our common stock and the number of its executives who serve on our board of directors 
there can be no assurance that its interests are aligned with that of our other shareholders 
investor interests can differ from each other and from other corporate interests and it is possible that this significant stockholder with a stake in corporate management may have interests that differ from those of other stockholders and of the company itself 
if news corporation were to sell all or a large percentage of its holdings  our stock price could decline and we could find it difficult to raise capital  if needed  through the sale of additional equity securities 
in addition  this concentration of ownership could delay or prevent a third party from acquiring control over us at a premium over the then current market price of our common stock 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market values of our investments 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio or to hedge for interest rate fluctuations on our debt 
we invest a majority of our excess cash in money market funds maintained with several high credit quality financial institutions 
we also invest in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in fixed rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in fair value due to changes in interest rates
