item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading manufacturer and marketer of a diversified portfolio of well recognized branded consumer products 
for the year ended december   we generated approximately of our sales from products in the number one or number two market share position in the united states 
our lines of business include infant care  feminine care  sun care and household and personal grooming products 
in february  we announced a realignment plan to improve focus on our core categories  reduce organizational complexity and obtain a more competitive cost structure 
this is a continuation of our operational restructuring that began in late some of the specific realignment initiatives include consolidation of the us international divisional structure in favor of a product category structure  realignment of the sales and marketing organizations and related support functions  rationalization of manufacturing  warehousing and office facilities  including the outsourcing of gloves production to malaysia and a reduction in the corporate headquarters office space 
we estimate that annual savings related to this phase will be between and million  which will be fully realized in we expect net savings from the actions to be between and million in we estimate that charges related to the realignment are expected to total between and million by the end of of this amount  we recorded million of restructuring costs and million of other related costs in sg a in the fourth quarter of related primarily to severance costs under our existing severance policy 
management estimates that cost for and related to severance for employee terminations and a voluntary early retirement program will be in the range of to million  costs for contract termination will be in the range of to million  and other related expenses will be approximately to million 
we estimate that cash payments associated with this realignment will total between and million and will occur during and into see note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
in the fourth quarter of  we concluded that an asset impairment charge was required due to the impact of increased competition in baby toiletries and the impact of a change in strategic focus and the decline in the liquid breath freshener category for our binaca brand 
this non cash charge of million was required to write down the value of our baby magic and binaca trademarks see note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
on november   we completed the sale of the assets of our woolite rug and upholstery brand to bissell homecare  inc see note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
this transaction resulted in a gain of million on net proceeds of million 
woolite accounted for approximately of consolidated net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal our results include the impact of woolite sales and operating income through november  in october  a new management team took over the leadership at playtex 
mr 
neil p 
defeo was named president and chief executive officer 
mr 
kris j 
kelley joined playtex as senior vice president finance and in december was named executive vice president and chief financial officer 
the new management team has worked extensively to understand our brands and our operations 
in february  we refinanced our then outstanding senior indebtedness 
the new financing provides improved liquidity and eliminates financial maintenance covenants and near term principal amortization that were part of our prior credit facility 
since our new debt is predominately long term bonds  an effort to reduce debt requires us to repurchase bonds on the open market  in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise from time to time 
while our intent is to utilize a portion of excess cash to repurchase bonds in the future  such actions will depend on bond availability and premium levels and are subject to certain limitations and conditions contained in our credit facility 
fiscal includes million in restructuring costs  primarily for severance costs for employee terminations and costs associated with a voluntary early retirement program  related to the first phase of our operational restructuring announced in this is compared with the fiscal restructuring charge of million and an associated asset impairment charge of million related to the closure of our watervliet  new york plastic molding facility see note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
as part of a review of the classification of certain expenses  in the second quarter of  we reclassified cash discount expense as a reduction of revenue 
previously  this expense was included in sg a 
this reclassification amounted to million in fiscal and million in fiscal while this discount is a payment incentive  we are now including this with other trade incentives previously reported as a reduction to net sales by employing a broader definition of the emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
results of operations the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of income  including net sales by major product lines  as well as our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december   december  and december  the discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in this annual report on form k 
in thousands year ended december  december  december  net sales infant care feminine care sun care household and personal grooming woolite cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative restructuring  net loss on impairment of assets amortization of intangibles total operating expenses gain on sale of assets operating income interest expense expenses related to retirement of debt  net other expenses income before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change provision benefit for income taxes income before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change  net of  tax benefit net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales our consolidated net sales increased million  or  to million in net sales of infant care products increased million  or  to million in due to higher shipment volume versus the comparable period  primarily due to wet ones hand and face towelettes and disposable and reusable bottles 
the gains in these areas were partially offset by lower shipments in cups as competitive activity continues in this category 
net sales of feminine care products increased million  or  to million in this increase is due primarily to higher shipment volume driven by the launch of beyond  our new cardboard applicator tampon  in the first quarter of and stabilization of our overall tampon market share 
our tampon market share has been relatively flat since the fourth quarter of net sales of sun care products increased million  or  to million in the increase in net sales is due primarily to higher shipment volume related to improved weather versus the prior year 
in  poor weather conditions resulted in decreased consumption 
we continue to shift product shipments closer to consumption 
as a result  was positively impacted by the shift of approximately million of shipments from the fourth quarter of into the first quarter of this was a continuation of a trend noted in net sales of household and personal grooming products decreased million  or  to million in this decrease was due to lower shipment volumes in our personal grooming categories  which was a continuation of a declining category trend  and lower glove shipments due to competitive activity 
net sales of woolite decreased million  or  to million in  primarily as a result of our sale of the assets of the woolite rug and upholstery brand to bissell homecare  inc on november  gross profit our consolidated gross profit increased million  or  to million in as a percent of net sales  gross profit increased percentage points to in versus the increase in gross profit was due primarily to the increase in net sales  which accounted for approximately million 
the increase in gross profit as a percent of net sales was due primarily to improved product costs due  in part  to the first phase of our operational restructuring efforts announced in operating income our consolidated operating income increased million  or  to million in fiscal this increase was driven by a gain on the sale of woolite assets of million partially offset by a loss on asset impairment of million and net restructuring charges of million 
in fiscal  operating income was negatively impacted by a restructuring charge of million 
exclusive of these items  consolidated operating income increased million or as compared to fiscal this increase was due to higher gross profit of million driven by higher net sales partially offset by higher sg a of million as compared to fiscal the increase in sg a of million as compared to fiscal was driven by million of consulting and restructuring related costs as a result of our realignment initiatives  million of costs associated with implementation of the internal control requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of and higher advertising and promotional expenses of million 
included in sg a for fiscal were million of tampon litigation costs  which were reduced to million in fiscal operating income in was also positively impacted by million of out of period adjustments related primarily to a reduction of our estimate for advertising and promotional costs 
amortization of intangibles increased by million as compared to fiscal due primarily to the commencement of amortization of the non compete agreement for the former ceo in the fourth quarter of interest expense our consolidated interest expense increased million to million in the increase in interest expense is the result of higher interest rates on outstanding debt driven by the refinancing of our then existing senior debt in february the refinancing changed the composition of our debt such that we have considerably less variable rate indebtedness  although at higher interest rates  and more fixed rate debt 
in  our weighted average interest rate for all debt was for the year ended december   up percentage points versus the prior year 
our average debt balances decreased by million in versus expenses related to retirement of debt on february   we refinanced our then outstanding credit facility and terminated our receivables facility 
we wrote off approximately million in unamortized deferred financing costs relating to our then outstanding term c loan  revolver  credit agreement and related amendments and million of an unamortized fee paid to originate the receivables facility in in addition  we recorded a net gain of million  which included a write off of million of unamortized deferred financing fees  as the result of the repurchase on the open market of the million principal of our notes see notes and to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
other expenses our consolidated other expenses were primarily the costs associated with our receivables facility 
since this facility was terminated as a result of our refinancing  costs associated with this facility decreased for fiscal  versus the prior year  by million 
provision benefit for income taxes our consolidated income tax benefit was million for fiscal compared to million of consolidated income tax expense in fiscal included in was a million income tax benefit resulting from the reversal of a previously established valuation allowance on a capital loss carryforward 
we had established a valuation allowance because we did not believe that we would utilize this capital loss carryforward before its expiration in december however  as a result of the gain generated by the sale of certain woolite assets  we were able to utilize a portion of this capital loss carryforward resulting in a reversal of the valuation allowance noted 
in addition  we recorded an income tax benefit of million in as a result of the favorable outcome of certain tax audits 
exclusive of these two income tax benefits  our effective tax rate would have been compared to in fiscal year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales our consolidated net sales decreased million  or  to in net sales of infant care products decreased million  or  to million in this decrease was due primarily to lower shipments in our non core baby wipes business and in baby toiletries approximately million and  to a lesser extent  mix of products sold 
our us dollar market share across our core infant care categories  including baby toiletries  had been declining since the end of baby magic toiletries was impacted by competitive activity resulting in its continued market share decline through in wet ones  our us dollar market share increased over seven percentage points in the diaper genie brand remained the us market leader in overall dollar market share in net sales of feminine care products decreased million  or  to million in this decrease is related primarily to lower shipment volume 
our us dollar market share in tampons decreased percentage points in versus this decline in our net sales and our dollar market share reflects the impact of extensive competitive spending in the tampon category behind the launch of a new competitive entry in the plastic applicator segment at the end of this product launch was aimed directly at our plastic applicator tampon product and negatively impacted our shipments and market share in in addition  our promotional activities in led to a build up of inventories of our product at retailers that negatively impacted our shipments in when the product was sold through to our consumers 
our shipment patterns for the second half of and throughout were more closely aligned with consumer purchases from the retailer for this period 
we introduced improved products  which reached retail shelves in the second quarter of we defended our business aggressively with advertising and promotional spending as well as product enhancements and new product offerings 
net sales of sun care products decreased million  or  to million in this decrease in net sales was due primarily to lower shipment volumes caused by unfavorable weather patterns in the us in the sun care season 
this was partially offset by a shift in shipments from the fourth quarter of to the first quarter of the sun care category was negatively impacted by unfavorable weather patterns early in the sun care season with the us category off by versus the prior year  the first category decline since our acquisition of banana boat 
as part of our initiative to reduce the impact of seasonal returns  which are typically higher in years when the weather is unfavorable  we more closely monitored customer shipments throughout the season by reviewing their inventory levels and consumption trends 
this proactive process resulted in a reduced level of product returns despite the unfavorable weather impact on consumption 
net sales of household and personal grooming products declined million  or  to million in this decrease is the result of lower unit shipments in ogilvie and binaca  despite us market share gains in each product  as the at home permanent and liquid breath freshener categories continue to decline 
in gloves  our us dollar market share continued to decline in versus the comparable period in this decline was due to a continuation of competitive activities and higher growth in the disposable glove segment of the category 
while we offer a disposable glove product  we have a greater market share of the reusable glove segment 
net sales of woolite rug and upholstery products increased million  or  to million in due to the success of the woolite oxy deep product  which was launched in gross profit our consolidated gross profit decreased million to million in as a percent of net sales  gross profit decreased percentage points  to in the decrease in gross profit and gross profit as a percent of net sales was due primarily to the decrease in net sales  which accounted for approximately million  and to a lesser extent the mix of products sold 
operating income our consolidated operating income decreased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal this decrease was due primarily to lower gross profit of million driven by lower net sales 
in addition  sg a increased million in fiscal versus fiscal operating income in included a restructuring charge of million related to the first phase of our operational restructuring announced in december as a result of closing our watervliet  new york plastic molding facility  operating income in fiscal was negatively impacted by a million restructuring charge and a million asset impairment charge 
the increase in sg a of million in fiscal as compared to fiscal was driven by million of tampon litigation costs incurred in the defense of our tampon business  higher advertising and promotional expenses of million due  in part  to our tampon defense and million of costs associated with our search for a potential acquirer 
interest expense our consolidated interest expense decreased million  or  to million in the decrease in interest expense was due to the combined impact of lower average debt balances and lower interest rates when compared to the prior year 
our average debt decreased million  or  in additionally  our weighted average variable interest rate in was compared to in expenses related to retirement of debt on may   we amended our then outstanding credit facility and issued a million term c loan and  together with million of cash  we repaid in full our obligations under our then outstanding term a loan and term b loan  which collectively totaled million 
during the second quarter ended june   we wrote off million of unamortized deferred financing costs relating to our term a loan and term b loan 
other expenses our consolidated other expenses decreased million  or  to million in the amount charged to other expenses primarily represents the fees to the third party on the sale of receivables and the amortization of deferred fees associated with the formation of the receivables facility see note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
since this cost is based  in part  on short term interest rates  it declined in comparison to as interest rates declined 
provision for income taxes our consolidated income taxes decreased million  or  to million in as a percent of pretax income  our effective tax rate increased percentage points to of income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
included in the effective tax rate is a benefit of approximately million related to the reversal of tax reserves associated with tax years where the statute of limitations for assessment had expired 
absent this benefit  the effective tax rate would have been approximately 
this is compared to  during which we recorded a tax benefit of million due to new regulations issued by the us treasury on march  see note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
the new regulations permitted us to partially utilize a previously disallowed capital loss on the sale of playtex beauty care  inc  which we sold during fiscal the remaining tax benefit associated with the sale of playtex beauty care  inc of million had been fully reserved by a valuation allowance  as we did not expect to realize it 
subsequently  we utilized a portion of the capital loss carryforward to offset a capital gain on the sale of the woolite brand assets in late the remaining portion of the playtex beauty care  inc capital loss carryforward expired at the end of another benefit  recognized in  was the reversal of tax reserves associated with the favorable settlement of a foreign tax audit in canada 
excluding the benefit of the previously disallowed capital loss and the benefit related to the foreign tax audit settlement  our effective tax rate in would have been approximately 
cumulative effect of accounting change we adopted  on december   statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 we ceased the amortization of a all of our remaining goodwill balance and b trademarks that were determined to have indefinite lives 
in connection with the new requirements set forth in sfas no 
 we performed impairment tests on our indefinite lived intangible assets based on a fair value concept 
as a result of this testing  we recorded an after tax impairment in trademarks for certain non core businesses of million as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the first quarter of the trademark impairment from this initial implementation was directly attributable to the different approach in evaluating impairment upon adoption of sfas no 
discounted cash flow method as compared to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  undiscounted cash flow coverage of carrying value 
consistent with the requirements of sfas no 
 an impairment resulting from the change in methodology was handled as a cumulative effect of accounting change see note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents as compared to million at december  this balance was positively impacted by the net proceeds from the sale of the woolite brand assets on november  of million 
the remaining increase resulted from cash provided by operations 
this cash will be used to finance the seasonal inventory build for the sun care season  to make scheduled bond interest payments and to finance investments in our core brands 
in addition  we may repurchase long term bonds in the open market from time to time depending on availability and premium rates in the marketplace and are subject to certain limitations and conditions contained in our credit facility 
subsequent to year end  as of march   we have repurchased million principal amount of our notes 
cash flows analysis in thousands year ended december  december  december  net cash provided by operations net cash provided by used for investing activities net cash used for financing activities net cash provided by operations our net cash provided by operations increased million  to million in fiscal the increase in net cash provided by operations was due primarily to improved cash flow from changes in working capital components 
for the year ended december   the working capital components impacted operating cash flow as follows accounts receivable increased by million as compared to fiscal year end however  this increase includes the fact that million of receivables had been sold to a third party as part of the receivables facility at fiscal year end this facility was terminated in thus  all receivables returned to the balance sheet 
exclusive of the increase due to the termination of the receivables facility  accounts receivable declined year over year by million due equally to the timing of shipments and an overall improvement in days sales outstanding 
inventories decreased at december  as compared to december  by million 
this decrease was due to the impact of the first phase of our operational restructuring  which was initiated in december this initiative included improved supply chain processes targeted to reduce inventory investment 
accrued expenses increased by million at december  as compared to december  this increase included a number of items most notably  higher accrued interest of million as the refinancing in early changed the timing of interest payments  higher accrued employee compensation and benefits of million  higher accruals for restructuring costs of million resulting from our realignment plan and higher advertising and sales promotion accruals of million due primarily to the timing of programs and payments 
net cash provided by investing activities our cash provided by investing activities of million was primarily driven by the proceeds from the sale of our woolite brand assets of million 
this was partially offset by capital expenditures to support new products  upgrade production equipment  invest in new technologies  and improve our facilities 
capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately million 
additionally in  we paid million for intangible assets including million to our former ceo as part of a non compete agreement  which represents the initial payment 
an additional million will be paid over each of the next two years 
net cash used for financing activities our cash used for financing activities of million in represented net long term debt borrowings of million  the payment of fees of million associated with our refinancing and payment of million to repurchase million principal of our notes on the open market 
this increase in long term borrowings was due  in part  to the termination of our off balance sheet receivables facility  which brought million of debt back on the balance sheet 
we intend to fund our operating cash  capital expenditures and debt service requirements through cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolver through fiscal however  we may not generate sufficient cash from operations to make either the million scheduled principal payment on the notes  as adjusted for note repurchases subsequent to year end  or the million notes  both due in fiscal accordingly  we may have to refinance our obligations  sell assets or raise equity capital to repay the principal amounts of these obligations 
historically  our cash from operations and refinancing activities have enabled us to meet all of our obligations 
however  we cannot guarantee that our operating results will continue to be sufficient or that future borrowing facilities will be available for the payment or refinancing of our debt on economically attractive terms 
refinancing as fully described in notes and of our consolidated financial statements  on february   we refinanced our indebtedness under our then existing credit facility the refinancing transaction 
this refinancing provided improved liquidity and eliminates financial maintenance covenants and near term principal amortization that were part of our prior credit facility 
proceeds from this refinancing transaction were used to repay our outstanding indebtedness under our existing credit agreement and to terminate the receivables facility 
the refinancing transaction consisted of million principal amount of notes  and a five year million variable rate credit facility the credit facility  comprised of a million term loan  which we repaid and terminated in the third quarter of  and a million revolving credit facility the revolver 
the availability under the revolver is subject to a borrowing base calculation  which is dependent upon the level of certain assets including eligible receivables  eligible inventory and eligible equipment  as defined in the credit facility 
as of december   our availability under the revolver  based on our borrowing base calculation  is million  as reduced for our outstanding letters of credit  as defined in the credit facility 
the rates of interest we have paid in the past  and will continue to pay in the future  on our variable rate debt are  at our option  a function of various alternative short term borrowing rates  such as the prime rate or the london inter bank offer rate libor 
as a result of the refinancing transaction  we incurred an estimated million in fees and expenses  which have been deferred and are being amortized over the term of the notes and the credit facility 
additionally  on february   we repurchased on the open market million principal of our notes at a discount 
in conjunction with this refinancing  we wrote off approximately million in unamortized fees associated with the refinanced debt 
as a result of the refinancing transaction  our debt portfolio and interest rate profile has changed substantially 
all of our indebtedness at december  is comprised of fixed rate notes  as the refinancing transaction substantially reduced our exposure to variable rate indebtedness 
as a result  our exposure to changing interest rates is dramatically reduced 
a one percentage point change in our variable interest rate would not have a material impact on our consolidated interest expense due to the reduction of our variable rate indebtedness based on balances at december  due to the attributes of our debt portfolio  reductions of our outstanding debt may require that we repurchase bonds on the open market  in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise from time to time 
such repurchases are subject to bond availability and may require substantial premiums depending on prices in the marketplace 
our credit facility contains various restrictions and limitations that may impact us 
these restrictions and limitations relate to incurrence of indebtedness  contingent obligations  liens  capital expenditures  mergers and acquisitions  asset sales  dividends and distributions  redemption or repurchase of equity interests  certain debt payments and modifications  loans and investments  transactions with affiliates  changes of control  payment of consulting and management fees  and compliance with laws and regulations 
on october   we amended our credit facility to allow for the sale of the woolite brand assets 
this amendment also allows us to use the proceeds of the woolite sale and excess cash to repurchase long term bonds  subject to certain conditions and availability requirements under the credit facility 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december   in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating lease obligations purchase obligations and other total does not include interest 
includes open purchase orders primarily for the procurement of raw materials  packaging and supplies for use in the production process 
excludes severance payments under the strategic realignment plan see note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts and timing of revenue and expenses  the reported amounts and classification of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could vary from our estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical results  assumptions that we make  as well as assumptions by third parties 
key areas where assumptions and estimates are used include sun care returns our practice is not to accept returned goods unless authorized by management of the sales organization 
returns result primarily from damage and shipping discrepancies 
exceptions to this policy include our sun care seasonal returns 
we allow customers to return sun care products that have not been sold by the end of the sun care season  which is normal practice in the sun care industry 
we record sales at the time the products are shipped and title transfers 
the terms of these sales vary but  in all instances  the following conditions are met the sales arrangement is evidenced by purchase orders submitted by customers  the selling price is fixed or determinable  product has shipped and title transferred  there is an obligation to pay at a specified date or dates without any additional conditions or actions required by us  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
simultaneously with the time of the shipment  we reduce sales and cost of sales  and reserve amounts on our consolidated balance sheet for anticipated returns based upon an estimated return level  in accordance with gaap 
customers are required to pay for the sun care product purchased during the season under the required terms 
we offer a variety of terms options  due to the seasonal nature of sun care  for qualified customers 
in all cases  these terms require substantial cash payments prior to or during the summer sun care season 
we generally receive returns of our sun care products from september through march following the summer sun care season 
we estimate the level of sun care returns using a variety of inputs including historical experience  consumption trends during the sun care season and inventory positions at key retailers as we move through the sun care season 
we monitor shipment activity and inventory levels at key retailers during the season in an effort to gauge potential returns issues 
this allows us to manage shipment activity to our customers  especially in the latter stages of the sun care season  to reduce the potential for returned product 
the level of returns may fluctuate from our estimates due to several factors including weather conditions  customer inventory levels  and competitive conditions 
based on our sun care results  each percentage point change in our returns rate would have impacted our reported net sales by million and our reported operating income by million 
bad debt reserves the extension of trade credit carries with it the chance that the customer may not pay for the goods when payment is due 
we review our receivables portfolio and provide reserves for potential bad debts including those we know about and those that have not been identified but may exist due to the risk associated with the granting of credit 
the estimated reserves required to cover potential losses are developed using historical experience  analysis of our accounts receivable aging and the overall credit worthiness of our portfolio of customers 
reserve balances are based on the best information available to us and are re evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
the adequacy of the estimated reserve may be impacted by the deterioration of a large customer and or significant weakness in the economic environment resulting in a higher level of customer bankruptcy filings 
long lived assets long lived assets  including fixed assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives  are evaluated periodically for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the estimate of cash flow requires significant management judgment and requires  among other things  certain assumptions about future volume  revenue and expense growth rates  and as such  may differ from actual cash flows 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed periodically for possible impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
our impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant management judgments  similar to those noted above for long lived assets  and for the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
we measure fair value for purposes of testing our trademarks for impairment using the relief from royalty method a discounted cash flow methodology 
our research indicates that this is the most widely used approach for valuing assets of this type 
we consider a number of factors in determining the relevant variables for this calculation including royalty rates for similar products licensed in the marketplace and the additional rights and obligations inherent in the ownership of a trademark as opposed to a licensing arrangement including product extension  geographical expansion opportunities  exclusivity of use and transferability 
in addition  we utilize a discount rate that reflects the rights and obligations of ownership  which results in an inherent premium as compared to a valuation of a licensing agreement since the discount rate of a licensee would reflect the additional risks of a license only arrangement 
an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows  which represents the estimated fair value of the asset 
we use our judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations 
indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors  unanticipated technological change or competitive activities may signal that an asset has become impaired 
we performed our annual goodwill and other intangible assets impairment testing during the second quarter of in december  we reviewed certain trademark intangibles for impairment based on a change in the competitive environment in our baby toiletries business  the continued decline in product categories for certain non core brands and the decision by management to no longer invest capital and promotional resources in certain of these non core businesses 
this review resulted in a non cash charge of million as it was determined that two trademarks  baby magic and binaca  were impaired see note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
promotion accruals we offer a variety of sales incentive programs to customers and consumers  such as cooperative advertising programs  feature price discounts  in store display incentives and consumer coupons 
the recognition of the costs for these programs  which are classified as a reduction of revenue  involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates 
accruals for trade promotions are recorded primarily at the time of sale of product to the customer based on expected levels of performance 
settlement of these liabilities typically occurs in subsequent periods primarily through an authorized process for deductions taken by a customer from amounts otherwise due to us 
as a result  the ultimate cost of a trade promotion program is dependent on the relative success of the events 
accruals for consumer coupons are made at the time the coupon is distributed 
these estimates are made utilizing the value of the coupon and the expected redemption rates 
expected redemption rates are determined using historical redemption experience for similar programs 
we monitor monthly redemption activity with the assistance of a third party  which tracks actual redemptions and provides updated estimates for future redemptions of the coupons 
actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance vary from estimates 
restructuring and related charges restructuring liabilities are recorded for estimated costs of facility closures  significant organizational adjustments  and measures undertaken by us to exit certain activities 
we estimate the costs of such activities after evaluating detailed analyses of the cost to be incurred 
such liabilities could include amounts for items such as severance costs and related benefits including settlements of pension plans  impairment of property and equipment  other current or long term assets  lease termination payments  plus any other items directly related to the exit activities 
while the actions are carried out as expeditiously as possible  restructuring and related charges are estimates 
changes in estimates resulting in an increase to or a reversal of a previously recorded liability may be required as we execute the restructuring plan 
during fiscal  we adopted the requirements of sfas no  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which impacts the timing of recognition of certain exit or disposal costs 
restructuring and related charges  which are reflected in operating expenses  include but are not limited to  termination and related costs  any asset impairments relating to the restructuring  and other costs directly related to the initiatives implemented 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of recent restructuring initiatives and related costs 
pension and postretirement benefits included in our results of operations are pension and postretirement costs and credits  which are measured using actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including assumptions about discount rates  expected return on plan assets  annualized increases in salaries and wages  the future number of participants and the future cost of health care 
these assumptions are updated on an annual basis 
we are required to consider market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
a percentage point change in the discount rate  with all other assumptions held constant  would impact net periodic pension expense and net periodic postretirement benefit expense by approximately million  respectively 
a percentage point change in the long term rate of return on plan assets would impact net periodic pension expense by approximately million 
a percentage point change in the long term health care cost trend would have less than a million impact on the service and interest components of net periodic postretirement benefit expense 
other significant accounting policies other significant accounting policies  primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed above  are also critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements

recently issued accounting standards in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp sfas no 
 accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act 
the act was signed into law on december  and expanded medicare to include prescription drugs 
we sponsor retiree medical programs and this legislation includes a federal subsidy for qualifying companies 
fsp sfas requires that the effects of the federal subsidy be considered an actuarial gain and treated like similar gains and losses if it is determined that the prescription drug benefits of the retiree medical program are determined to be actuarially equivalent to those offered under medicare part d 
we adopted fsp sfas during our third quarter ended september  and concluded that we are unable to determine whether the benefits under our plan are actuarially equivalent to medicare part d under the act because the guidance provided thus far is unclear 
we will monitor our plan and assess actuarial equivalence as new information becomes available

in december  the fasb issued fsp fasb  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of the act introduces a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer repatriation provision  provided certain criteria are met 
fsp fas provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision  and is effective immediately

management continued this evaluation process through february  at which time a domestic reinvestment plan the drp was completed 
the drp provides for our canadian subsidiary to pay a c million dividend in one or more installments during that will be used to partially fund our us advertising programs 
we have fully provided us taxes for the undistributed earnings of our canadian subsidiary at the statutory rate of 
in the first quarter of  we will record a tax benefit of approximately million to reflect the reduced tax rate associated with this special repatriation  which is substantially below our statutory rate noted above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we periodically use financial instruments  such as derivatives  to manage the impact of interest rate changes on our variable rate debt and its effect on our income and cash flows 
our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for the sole purpose of trading for profit on price fluctuations  or to enter into contracts  which intentionally increase our underlying interest rate exposure 
as a result of the refinancing transaction on february  see notes and to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k  our debt portfolio and interest rate profile has changed substantially 
our indebtedness at december  was comprised of million of notes and million of notes 
as such  at december   a one percentage point change in our variable interest rate would not have a material impact on our consolidated interest expense

we conduct our international operations in a variety of countries and derive our sales in currencies including the euro  british pound  canadian dollar and australian dollar  as well as the us dollar 
our results may be subject to volatility because of currency changes  inflation changes and changes in political and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate 
the majority of our products are manufactured in the us  but we do source some equipment  finished goods  componentry and raw materials from overseas
