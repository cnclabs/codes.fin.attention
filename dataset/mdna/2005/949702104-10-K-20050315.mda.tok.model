item legal proceedings in january  we received a document subpoena in connection with a federal grand jury investigation of pricing practices in the polyester staple fiber industry 
we cooperated with the investigation by producing documents in response to this subpoena 
on september   the department of justice doj informed us that it will not seek indictments either of wellman or any of its employees in connection with this investigation 
on october   the judge presiding over the federal civil cases discussed below announced on the record that he had been informed by doj that there would be no further criminal prosecution in connection with the investigation 
following the public disclosure of the investigation in september  numerous producers of polyester staple fiber  including wellman  have been named in various civil actions asserting claims based on alleged price fixing and market allocation in the polyester staple industry 
these proceedings are summarized below 
wellman and certain other companies are named as defendants in twenty four federal actions brought by direct purchasers of polyester staple fiber for alleged violation of us antitrust laws 
in each lawsuit  the plaintiffs allege that the defendants engaged in a conspiracy to fix the price of polyester staple fiber in violation of the sherman act 
in ten of the cases  the plaintiff purports to represent a class of all persons who directly purchased polyester staple fiber and were similarly affected by such alleged conduct 
fourteen of the cases are brought by plaintiffs who do not purport to represent a class 
certain of these cases name employees of wellman and other companies as defendants 
all of the federal plaintiffs seek damages of unspecified amounts  attorney s fees and costs and unspecified relief 
in addition  certain of the actions claim restitution  injunction against alleged illegal conduct and other equitable relief 
the federal suits were originally filed in the us district court for the middle district of alabama  us district court for the northern district of california  us district court for the middle district of georgia  us district court for the district of new jersey  us district court for the middle district of north carolina  us district court for the western district of north carolina  us district court for the district of south carolina and us district court for the western district of virginia 
the judicial panel on multi district litigation ruled on april  to transfer all the federal cases to the western district of north carolina for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings 
in addition to the direct purchaser actions discussed above  forty one purported class actions alleging violations of federal antitrust laws  state antitrust or unfair competition laws and certain state consumer protection acts have been filed in one federal court and various state courts on behalf of purported classes of indirect purchasers of polyester staple fiber products 
in each lawsuit  the plaintiffs allege that the defendants engaged in a conspiracy to fix prices of polyester staple fiber products 
in addition  certain of the actions claim restitution  injunction against alleged illegal conduct and other equitable relief 
one indirect purchaser case is pending in the us district court for the western district of north carolina and is subject to the order issued by the judicial panel on multi district litigation for coordination or consolidation with the other federal cases 
the rest of the indirect purchaser cases were filed in arizona  california  the district of columbia  florida  kansas  massachusetts  michigan  new mexico  north carolina  south dakota  tennessee  west virginia and wisconsin 
in all of these cases  the plaintiffs seek damages of unspecified amounts  attorney s fees and costs and unspecified relief 
wellman and certain other companies were named in an action filed in the superior court of justice for ontario  canada  by a plaintiff purporting to represent a class of direct and indirect purchasers of polyester staple fiber 
this complaint asserts claims under canadian law 
it contains three counts that ask for compensatory damages of cdn 
each 
the extent to which these three counts are duplicative and overlapping is unclear 
the complaint also contains one count asking for punitive damages of cdn 
additionally  wellman and certain other companies were also named in an action filed in the supreme court of british columbia  canada  by a plaintiff purporting to represent a class of direct and indirect purchasers of polyester staple fiber 
this complaint also asserts claims under canadian law and requests compensatory  punitive and special damages  but does not allege a specific dollar amount in damages 
finally  wellman and certain other corporations were named in an action filed in the superior court for quebec  canada 
this complaint asserts claims under canadian law seeking compensatory damages of cdn 
and punitive damages of cdn 
we deny that we or any of our employees engaged in price fixing or customer allocation and we intend to vigorously defend against any existing civil claims and any civil claims or proceedings that may be brought against us in the future 
because of the uncertainties and complexity of these civil claims  we have not formed an opinion about these proceedings or their impact  if any  on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in addition to the foregoing  we may become subject to additional proceedings and lawsuits under federal and state antitrust and unfair competition laws

dividends paid were per share in and per share in    and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions  except per share data general we are principally engaged in the manufacturing and marketing of high quality permaclear brand pet polyethylene terephthalate packaging resins  fortrel brand polyester staple fibers and wellamid engineering resins 
we believe we are the world s largest pet plastics recycler  utilizing a significant amount of recycled raw materials in our manufacturing operations 
at december   we had annual operating capacity to manufacture approximately billion pounds of pet resins and billion pounds of polyester staple fiber at five major production facilities in the united states and europe 
our operations are classified into two reportable operating segments the packaging products group or ppg and the fibers and recycled products group or frpg 
our permaclear pet resins are produced by the ppg from purified terephtalic acid pta and monoethylene glycol meg  and ecoclear pet resins are produced from a combination of chemical and recycled raw materials 
these resins are primarily used in the manufacturing of plastic soft drink bottles and other food and beverage packaging 
the frpg produces fortrel polyester staple fiber and other polyester and nylon staple fibers that are primarily used in apparel  non woven  home furnishing and industrial products 
these fibers are also produced from pta and meg and recycled raw materials 
demand for both north american and global pet resins continues to grow  driven by new product applications for pet and conversions from other packaging materials to pet 
demand for polyester staple fiber in the united states is subject to changes in consumer preferences and spending  retail sales patterns  and fiber and textile product imports 
imports of products throughout the textile chain continue to negatively impact the united states and european fiber markets  adversely affecting our operating results 
our profitability is primarily determined by our sales volume and our raw material margin  which is the difference between net selling price and raw material cost 
both pet resin and polyester staple fiber volume and raw material margins increase or decrease as a result of supply and demand factors and competitive conditions 
given our substantial unit volumes  the impact on profitability of changes in raw material margins is significant 
a one cent per pound change in raw material margin on approximately billion pounds of resin and fiber sales volume results in an annual change of approximately in pretax earnings 
volumes  selling prices and raw material costs each may be affected by actions of our competitors  global economic and market conditions  export and import activity  and the prices and availability of competing materials 
seasonal factors  such as weather and the vacation and holiday closings of our facilities or those of our customers  may also affect our operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in financial statements and accompanying notes 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  therefore  we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our evaluation of the credit worthiness of our customers and the potential risks inherent in their businesses 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables  especially in light of the difficult economic conditions facing our frpg customers 
these judgments could vary significantly from actual amounts realized  resulting in changes in bad debt expense and allowances 
the allowance for doubtful accounts will increase or decrease based on circumstances or specific events impacting specific customers 
specific events include bankruptcy filings  changes in the customers credit ratings and or other information 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is principally determined by the first in  first out method 
the physical condition ie  quality of the inventories is also considered in establishing the valuation 
these judgments are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual results for various reasons  including changes in future economic conditions  customer inventory levels  or competitive conditions that differ from our expectations 
changes in our inventory valuation resulting from such variances would affect our cost of sales 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are carried at cost 
depreciation for assets is provided based on their estimated useful lives and is computed using the straight line method and the units of production method 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to our capital strategy  or changes to our business model could result in the actual lives differing from our estimates  in which case our earnings could be affected 
when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a fixed asset group may not be recoverable  we will test the fixed asset group for impairment 
if any of the impairment indicators are present or if other circumstances indicate impairment may exist  we then determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized 
we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the fixed asset group to determine its fair market value and whether or not a potential impairment exists 
our fixed asset group is defined as an entire facility or site 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows  we then calculate and record the impairment  which is equal to the excess of the carrying value of the asset over the estimate of its fair market value 
goodwill and other intangible assets through december   we amortized goodwill on a straight line method over periods ranging from to years 
effective january   we were required to adopt sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
based on this standard  goodwill is no longer amortized  but is tested at least annually at the reporting unit level for impairment 
goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
the fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future discounted cash flows 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired 
a comparison is then made between the implied fair value of the goodwill  as defined by sfas no 
 and the carrying value of the goodwill 
if the implied fair value is less  an impairment loss equal to the difference is recognized 
this implied fair value then becomes the new carrying value of the goodwill for future impairment tests 
the estimate of future discounted cash flows is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about future operating performance 
our estimates of future discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  changes in economic conditions  our business model  or our operating performance 
deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize the recorded value of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase earnings in the period such determination was made 
pension benefits we have defined benefit plans and defined contribution pension plans that cover substantially all employees 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability asset related to the defined benefit plans 
key factors include assumptions about the expected rates of return on plan assets and discount rates as determined by management within certain guidelines 
we consider market conditions  including changes in investment returns and interest rates  in making these assumptions 
in determining our long term rate of return on plan assets  our objective is to obtain the highest possible return over the long term commensurate with the appropriate level of assumed risk 
in order to moderate the investment portfolio s risk and volatility  we forecast financial market returns over a wide range of potential future economic trends 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is a long term assumption and is reviewed annually 
the discount rate reflects the market rate for high quality fixed income debt instruments at december and is subject to change each year 
holding all other assumptions constant  a one percentage point decrease in the assumed rate of return on plan assets for one year would result in an actuarial loss in of approximately likewise  a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase our projected benefit obligations by approximately unrecognized actuarial gains or losses are amortized using the corridor method as defined by sfas no 
for our domestic defined benefit plans and dutch plan 
for the irish plans  we separately identify actuarial gains and losses and use an amortization method  which spreads the entire gain or loss each year  without regard to the corridor over a period of five years  subject to the minimum amortization requirements of sfas no 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors including experience and assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on plan assets 
the actuarial assumptions we used in determining our pension benefits may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates  or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our financial position or results of operations 
environmental liability our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing air emissions  wastewater discharges  and solid and hazardous waste management activities 
our policy is to expense environmental remediation costs when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the accruals represent our best estimate of probable non capital environmental expenditures 
the final resolution of these contingencies could result in expenses different than current accruals  and therefore may have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements and accounting changes in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
or fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary which is the entity subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
we do not currently have any variable interest entities 
the adoption of this statement did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued a revision to sfas no 
 employers disclosure about pensions and other postretirement benefits  an amendment to fasb statements no 
  and and a revision of fasb statement no 
or sfas r 
this statement requires additional disclosure in relation to the types of plan assets  investment strategy  measurement date s  plan obligations  cash flows and components of net periodic benefit cost recognized during interim periods 
the provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements with fiscal years ending after december  the interim period disclosures are effective for interim periods beginning after december  the company adopted sfas r in december in december  the fasb issued an exposure draft  earnings per share  an amendment of fasb statement no 
in december  the fasb decided to defer the issuance of their final standard 
the final standard will be effective in and will require retrospective application of all prior periods presented 
this statement will amend the computational guidance of sfas no 
 where the number of incremental shares included in the year to date diluted eps would be computed using the average market price of common shares for the year to date period 
this statement also requires that shares to be issued upon conversion of a mandatorily convertible security be included in the computation of basic eps from the date that conversion becomes mandatory 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing 
this statement clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and waster spoilage 
such abnormal expenses must be recognized in the period in which they are incurred 
in addition  this statement requires the allocation of fixed production overhead to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
unallocated overhead must be recognized as an expense in the period in which it is incurred 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment or sfas r 
this statement is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the provisions of this statement are effective for interim or annual periods beginning after june  we expect to adopt sfas r on july   using the standard s modified prospective method 
as permitted by statement no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb no 
s intrinsic value method  and  as such  generally recognize compensation expense only when there is a difference between the exercise price of the stock options and the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
had we expensed the fair value of employee stock options under sfas no 
for the year ended december   our net loss and diluted eps would have increased by  or per diluted share see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as the number of stock options issued fluctuates each year  the future impact to our financial statements upon adoption of the statement cannot be predicted with certainty 
under sfas no 
r  the fair value would be amortized into compensation expense over the vesting period of the stock options 
continued dumping and subsidy offset act cdo of in april  a coalition of three polyester fiberfill producers  including us  filed an anti dumping suit against polyester fiberfill producers located in korea and taiwan 
these polyester fiberfill producers located in korea and taiwan were selling fiberfill in the us at prices lower than their own domestic market prices  resulting in material injury to us polyester fiberfill producers 
in march  the commerce department determined that companies in both countries were dumping polyester fiberfill into the us in may  the international trade commission unanimously ruled that polyester fiberfill imports from korea and taiwan materially injured the united states domestic polyester fiberfill industry 
as a result of this determination and ruling  anti dumping duties ranging from to were imposed on all taiwanese polyester fiberfill producers  and duties ranging from to were imposed on most korean polyester fiberfill producers 
these duties are estimates based upon the producers past pricing histories 
the actual duties are determined retroactively for each fiscal year  based upon the pricing during that year 
importers of polyester fiberfill from covered producers in these two countries are required to post cash deposits equal to their estimated anti dumping duties 
the actual import duty rates can be adjusted annually and the total amount of import duties actually owed will depend upon the actual rates and the price and amount of goods imported 
import duties are normally retained by the government 
however  in october the us congress enacted the continued dumping and subsidy offset act of the cdo 
under the cdo  any anti dumping duties collected are paid to the injured companies who file claims to that effect 
we received   and of anti dumping payments pursuant to the cdo in   and  respectively 
in january  the world trade organization wto declared that the cdo is inconsistent with certain provisions of the wto agreement on anti dumping and subsidies 
this declaration is merely advisory  however  and has no legal effect 
the only body that can alter the cdo is the us congress 
to date  the congress has taken no action to do so 
there is no action that korea  taiwan or the wto could take that would require us to repay any of the import duties that were distributed to us in   and results of operations to total net sales from continuing operations for increased  or  to  from  in due to the following ppg frpg total net selling prices sales volumes foreign currency translation net selling price increases were initiated in both segments during in response to higher raw material costs 
sales volumes increased during in both our ppg and frpg primarily as a result of improved supply demand fundamentals  and an improved trade balance for us polyester staple fiber and nafta pet resin 
total cost of sales from continuing operations for increased  or  to  from  in due to the following ppg frpg total raw material costs plant added costs foreign currency translation the higher raw material costs are due to both increased sales volumes and higher purchase prices in both our chemical and recycled based businesses 
factors contributing to the higher purchase prices in the period are a tight supply demand balance for both chemical and recycled based raw materials and higher crude oil prices for our chemical based businesses 
plant added costs were lower overall compared to the same period last year as savings from our cost reduction programs more than offset higher depreciation and amortization  other non cash items  energy costs  and increases in volume for both the ppg and the frpg 
this allowed for significant reductions in our per unit costs 
the additional depreciation and amortization was principally a result of the february financing 
for additional information on the february financing  see note to the consolidated financial statements

in december  we abandoned the polyester staple fiber spinning and drawing equipment at our pearl river facility 
this decision was based on the determination that a conversion to pet resin production would be the most profitable use of the related polymerization assets 
we recorded a non cash impairment charge of in the fourth quarter of we are proceeding with the conversion  adding million pounds of additional solid stating capacity to our pearl river facility  in the first quarter of we incurred restructuring charges of and in and  respectively  related to our cost reduction programs see cost reduction programs below and note to the consolidated financial statements 
we recorded a charge for expected losses on accounts receivable of and in and  respectively 
additional bad debt expense was recorded in primarily due to a bankruptcy where we were a sole source supplier and not named as a critical vendor

for additional information on other expense income  see item selected consolidated financial data 
as a result of the foregoing  we reported an operating loss of in compared to in interest expense  net  was in compared to in this was the result of increased long term debt  higher credit spreads  and increased amortization of debt issuance costs in interest expense due to the february financing 
see outlook below for expected interest expense in our effective tax rate for on earnings loss from continuing operations was compared to for we incurred tax expense of relating to the repatriation of foreign cash at tax rates specified in the american jobs creation act 
excluding the of additional tax expense  our effective tax rate would have been  which increased from due to the relative proportion of us to foreign earnings 
as a result of the foregoing  we reported a loss from continuing operations of for  compared to a loss from continuing operations of for as a result of the june private equity investment  we recorded accretion of the preferred stock liquidation preference  including the amortization of the discount related to the valuation of the common stock warrants  of and in and  respectively 
in addition  we incurred a non cash beneficial conversion charge of in the fourth quarter of as a result of the preferred stock becoming convertible into common stock 
as a result of the foregoing  we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of  or per diluted share  for  compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of  or per diluted share  for to total net sales from continuing operations for increased  or  to  from  in due to the following ppg frpg total net selling prices foreign currency translation sales volumes ppg sales volume increased due to the previously mentioned continued demand growth in the pet resin market 
sales volumes decreased in the frpg due to the declining us textile industry 
total cost of sales from continuing operations for increased  or  to  from in due to the following ppg frpg total raw material costs plant added costs foreign currency translation higher raw material costs for the ppg were the result of increased unit costs due to temporary supply pressures and higher crude oil and natural gas costs 
the frpg experienced the same higher unit costs for raw materials  but this effect was offset in part by lower production volumes 
total plant added costs for the frpg were lower as a result of our on going cost reduction efforts and lower production levels 
as a result of the foregoing  gross profit decreased  or  to compared to in selling  general and administrative expenses were  or of net sales  in compared to  or of net sales  in the increase in is due primarily to consulting fees associated with our on going cost reduction program and increased new product development costs in our frpg 
in december  we abandoned the polyester staple fiber spinning and drawing equipment at our pearl river facility 
we recorded a non cash impairment charge of in the fourth quarter of this charge represents a reduction in the carrying value of the abandoned polyester staple fiber spinning and drawing assets at our pearl river facility to their estimated fair value 
for additional information on the impairment charge  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have historically focused on continuous process improvements and have successfully implemented cost reduction initiatives 
since  we have reduced domestic headcount by  while increasing production by and pounds per employee by over the same period 
during  we announced additional cost reduction plans as part of our on going low cost business strategy and in response to reduced profitability as a result of increased raw material costs  declines in pet resin prices in our ppg  and continuing declines in our frpg business 
in january  the frpg commenced a plan to restructure its operations  which included a reduction in the number of employees and other cost savings initiatives at our three fiber manufacturing facilities 
we recorded termination costs of in our frpg segment related to this plan  which was fully implemented in this plan has resulted in approximately of realized savings in controllable costs in compared to the prior year 
in july  we announced and implemented reductions in compensation and benefit costs 
these compensation and benefit reductions were implemented at all levels of the company  including senior management 
as part of this cost reduction effort  some employer contributions to the company s defined contribution plans were suspended 
in november  we announced a third plan with company wide cost reduction initiatives that included eliminating levels of management  reducing the number of employees  and other organization and administrative consolidations and changes 
we incurred severance and other termination costs of in the fourth quarter of associated with this plan 
these last two cost reduction plans resulted in approximately of realized savings in controllable costs in the second half of compared to our cost structure during the second quarter of for additional information on restructurings in  see note to the consolidated financial statements

in  we completed our initial assessment of goodwill using the two step approach described in sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and determined that the goodwill related to our frpg segment was impaired 
as a result  the carrying value of this goodwill was reduced by to its implied value 
the reduction was recorded as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in our financial statements 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the private equity investment  we recorded accretion of the preferred stock liquidation preference and of the discount related to the valuation of the common stock warrants of in in addition  we incurred a non cash beneficial conversion charge of in the fourth quarter of as a result of the preferred stock becoming convertible into common stock 
as a result of the foregoing  we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of  or per diluted share  in  compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of  or per diluted share  in cost reduction programs during  we announced cost reduction plans as part of our on going low cost business strategy and in response to reduced profitability as a result of increased raw material costs  declines in pet resin selling prices in the ppg  and a continuing decline in the frpg operating results 
in january  the frpg commenced a plan to restructure its operations  which included a reduction in the number of employees and other cost savings initiatives at our three fiber manufacturing facilities 
in  we recorded and paid termination costs of in our frpg segment related to this plan  which was fully implemented in in july  we announced reductions in compensation and benefit costs 
these compensation and benefit reductions were implemented at all levels  including senior management 
as part of this cost reduction effort  some employer contributions to our defined contribution plans were suspended 
effective january   we reinstated certain compensation and benefits to their previous levels 
in november  we announced a third plan with cost reduction initiatives that included eliminating levels of management  reducing the number of employees  and other organizational and administrative consolidations and changes 
during  we incurred severance and contract termination costs of associated with this plan  of which related to the ppg and related to the frpg 
severance and contract termination costs of were incurred in the fourth quarter of associated with this plan  of which related to the ppg and related to the frpg 
as a result of these cost reduction programs  we have reduced annual controllable costs by for the year ended december   compared to the second quarter of even with the reinstatement of certain compensation and benefits that were previously reduced  we expect to reduce annual controllable costs by approximately to cumulative by the end of  compared to annualized second quarter levels 
for additional information on restructurings  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
outlook the following statements are forward looking statements and should be read in conjunction with forward looking statements  risks and uncertainties below 
we expect that our operating results for will be better than our operating results for we believe this improvement will result primarily from improvements in pet resin and fiber raw material margins and the continuing effects of our cost reduction programs 
we expect pet resin capacity utilization in the nafta region to remain strong in as demand is expected to grow while capacity is expected to remain substantially the same 
this will support improved raw material margins for the nafta pet resin industry in we have announced selling price increases in our us pet resins business of and per pound effective march and april   respectively 
in addition  we have announced two per pound selling price increases in our domestic fibers business effective january and april  given the competitive nature of our business and other market influences  there can be no assurance that these price increases will be realized 
we expect that the domestic textile chain will continue to be adversely impacted by imports  especially from china  as all remaining quotas on all textile and apparel imports into the united states were eliminated as of january   pursuant to the gatt now known as the world trade organization agreement uruguay round agreement enacted in we expect to receive a payment  which we expect will be less than the amount we received in  under the continued dumping and subsidy offset act in the fourth quarter of we expect a continuation of a globally tight supply situation for polyester chemical raw materials in in a tight market  spot prices are generally higher then contract prices for polyester raw materials 
asian polyester producers  particularly china  are large spot purchasers  while us and european polyester producers are primarily contract purchasers of polyester raw materials 
therefore  a tight polyester raw material market is expected to eliminate or reduce the cost advantage that asian polyester producers have had in the past and should constrain pet resin and polyester fiber imports into the nafta region and european union 
this should improve our competitiveness in pet resin and fiber markets 
in addition  we believe our long term raw material supply contracts in place at december  provide us with sufficient raw materials for our existing and planned future production requirements through in  we announced several cost reduction plans to reduce our annual controllable costs 
as a result of these cost reduction programs  we have reduced annual controllable costs by for the year ended december   compared to the second quarter of even with the reinstatement of certain compensation and benefits that were previously reduced  we expect to reduce annual controllable costs by approximately to cumulative by the end of  compared to annualized second quarter levels

these expenses including non cash charges consisted of the following termination of swap agreements pre payment penalties write off of debt issuance costs other expenses non capitalizable financing costs as part of the restructuring of the sale and leaseback transaction in june of  we entered into three swaps  each with a notional amount of  which were designated as cash flow hedges 
these swaps hedged our exposure to variability in cash flows attributable to rent expense paid in relation to the sale and leaseback transaction 
as part of the february financing  we terminated two of the three swaps and redesignated the third as a cash flow hedge against debt entered into in conjunction with the february financing 
this fixed rate swap has a notional amount of  and we will receive three month libor and pay quarterly 
the termination  redesignation and refinancing resulted in an overall cost of  which was net of that was previously included in other comprehensive income loss 
in july  we entered into interest rate hedging agreements with financial institutions for a total notional amount of as follows two  year fixed rate swaps with a total notional amount of  where we will receive three month libor and pay quarterly  and a three year cap where  for quarterly periods when three month libor exceeds on its reset date  we will receive the difference between three month libor and on for such periods 
the year fixed rate swaps were designated as cash flow hedges against of the revolving credit facility entered into in the first quarter of at december   including the aforementioned redesignated swap  we have a total of in hedging agreements 
the following table describes our existing debt facilities at december  table i amounts available total amount under committed maturity facility commitment outstanding facilities revolving bank facility february first lien term loan february second lien term loan february other n a total in february  we terminated our unsecured senior revolving credit facility and entered into a five year  revolving credit facility secured by our domestic accounts receivable  domestic inventory and other related intangibles 
our borrowing capacity is based on our domestic accounts receivable and inventory  less outstanding letters of credit and the termination value of financial instruments  but cannot exceed our initial annual interest rate for amounts drawn under the facility is libor plus basis points the credit spread or the prime rate plus basis points  at our option 
beginning in the quarter ending june   pricing on the revolving credit facility will be based on our leverage ratio as defined in the revolving credit facility agreement 
the credit spread over libor and the prime rate will range from to basis points and to basis points  respectively 
in february  we entered into a five year  first lien term loan  which is primarily secured by our domestic real property  plant and equipment 
our annual interest rate is three month libor plus basis points and is paid quarterly 
there is a libor floor of basis points 
the principal matures on february  in february  we entered into a six year  second lien term loan  which is secured by a second priority interest in substantially all of our domestic assets 
our annual interest rate is three month libor plus basis points and is paid quarterly 
there is a libor floor of basis points 
the principal matures on february  the amount outstanding is net of of an original issue discount 
in addition to our debt commitments  we have entered into other commitments and contractual obligations that obligate us to make specified payments in the future 
the following table summarizes the total amounts due as of december  under all debt agreements  commitments and other contractual obligations

table ii payments due by period greater than less than years years years year contractual years years years obligations total year beyond debt agreements see table i operating leases total the amounts relating to debt agreements in table ii include of an original issue discount 
these amounts are as of december  and relate primarily to operating leases for our railcars  computer hardware  and executive offices 
since entering into the february financing  we do not have any material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  often referred to as special purpose entities  for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements with contractually narrow or limited purposes 
our debt agreements contain financial and restrictive covenants 
the terms of the revolving credit facility require that we maintain available liquidity as defined in the revolving credit facility of at least or maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio initially of at least this ratio increases to beginning with the four quarters ending december  and further increases to beginning with the four quarters ending march  the fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in the revolving credit facility  is earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization divided by the sum of cash taxes  cash interest expense  capital expenditures and certain payments related to our equity for the same period 
there are certain liquidity thresholds which must be met in order for us to settle lawsuits or pay judgments 
there are other restrictions which include limitations on capital expenditures  payment of dividends  asset sales and dispositions  the incurrence or guarantee of additional debt  acquisitions  certain payments and investments  affiliate and subsidiary transactions  repurchase of stock  and excess cash 
we are in compliance with all debt covenants 
the financial resources available to us at december  included approximately available under our revolving credit facility and internally generated funds 
we believe these financial resources will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our foreseeable needs for working capital  capital expenditures and dividends 
for additional information on the payment of dividends  see item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters 
environmental matters our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing air emissions  wastewater discharges and solid and hazardous waste management activities 
we take a proactive approach in addressing the applicability of these laws and regulations as they relate to our manufacturing operations and in proposing and implementing any remedial plans that may be necessary 
we have identified certain situations that will require future capital and non capital expenditures to maintain or improve compliance with current environmental laws and regulations 
the majority of the identified situations are found at our largest manufacturing facilities and primarily deal with groundwater remediation  quality of air emissions and wastewater treatment processes 
our policy is to expense environmental remediation costs when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
while it is often difficult to reasonably quantify future environmental related expenditures  we currently estimate our future non capital expenditures related to environmental matters to range between and in connection with these expenditures  we have accrued undiscounted liabilities of approximately and at december  and  respectively  which are reflected as other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
these accruals represent our best estimate of probable non capital environmental expenditures 
in addition  aggregate future capital expenditures related to environmental matters are expected to range from to these non capital and capital expenditures are expected to be incurred during the next to years 
for additional information  including changes in the accrued undiscounted liabilities  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
we base the measurement of liability on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual situation and take into consideration factors such as existing technology  presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites 
as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites  we review these liabilities periodically and adjust them to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available 
we believe we are either in material compliance with all currently applicable regulations or are operating in accordance with the appropriate variances and compliance schedules or similar arrangements 
subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs  we believe that compliance with current laws and regulations will not require significant capital expenditures or have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

forward looking statements  risks and uncertainties statements contained in this form k that are not historical facts  including those made in the outlook section above  are forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of in addition  words such as believes  expects  anticipates  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
these statements are made as of the date of this report based upon current expectations  and we undertake no obligation to update this information 
these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to reduced raw material margins  reduced sales volumes  increases in costs  the financial condition of our customers  polyester staple fiber and textile imports  availability and cost of raw materials  the impact of litigation arising out of alleged pricing practices in the polyester staple fiber industry  the actions of our competitors  the effective implementation of our cost reduction programs  availability of financing  changes in financial markets  interest rates  credit ratings  and foreign currency exchange rates  regulatory changes  tax risks  us  european  asian and global economic conditions  prices and volumes of pet resin imports  work stoppages  levels of production capacity and profitable operation of assets  prices of competing products  natural disasters and acts of terrorism  and maintaining the operations of our existing production facilities 
actual results may differ materially from those expressed herein 
results of operations in any past period should not be considered indicative of results to be expected in future periods 
fluctuations in operating results may result in fluctuations in the price of our common stock 
in addition to those described above  the more prominent risks and uncertainties inherent in our business are set forth below 
however  this section does not discuss all possible risks and uncertainties to which we are subject  nor can it be assumed necessarily that there are no other risks and uncertainties  which may be more significant to us 
risk related to our business reduced raw material margins could adversely affect our operating results 
raw material margin  which is the difference between our net selling price and the cost of our raw materials  is an extremely important factor in determining our operating results 
selling prices are influenced by competition and capacity utilization  which is the demand for product divided by total industry capacity 
demand for our product is determined principally by growth in end use markets  substitution of our product for other products  economic conditions  imports  and our products competitive cost position 
worldwide capacity is expanding for both resins and fiber 
any reduction of selling prices  our not achieving announced selling price increases or any significant expansion in capacity over demand could reduce our operating results 
any increase in raw material costs see our operations are dependent on the availability and cost of our raw materials below without a corresponding increase in selling price would reduce our operating results 
a material change in demand  supply  general economic conditions or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects could have a material adverse affect on our operating results 
reduced sales volume could adversely affect our operating results 
sales volume is another important factor in determining our operating results 
our sales volume is influenced by competition and capacity utilization 
a material change in demand  supply  general economic conditions or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects could have a material adverse effect on our sales volume and negatively impact our operating results 
increases in costs could adversely affect our operating results 
our inability to maintain our low cost position and efficiently operate our manufacturing facilities may reduce our operating results 
failure to achieve the balance of our announced controllable cost reductions or to maintain the cost reductions obtained to date  or our inability to efficiently operate our production facilities after implementation  may reduce our operating results 
in addition  we have certain non controllable costs where the expense we incur may change based on external factors and increases in these costs may reduce our operating results 
examples of these costs are energy  insurance and pension costs 
energy costs are impacted by changes in petrochemical costs and  as these increase  our cost of natural gas  electricity  steam and oil increases and may reduce our operating results by increasing our production costs 
insurance costs change depending on the market and our experience  and pension costs are impacted by the changes in the equity and debt markets 
the financial condition of our customers impacts our operating results 
our customers include manufacturers of plastic containers  textile mills  yarn spinners  manufacturers of non woven fabrics  and the injection molding industry 
our packaging products group or ppg has five customers that represented approximately of its total net sales in our fiber and recycled products group or frpg does not have any single customer that has a material effect on the segment 
if our customers have financial difficulties  this could affect our operating results by decreasing our sales and or resulting in the uncollectibility of accounts receivable 
polyester staple fiber and textile imports continue to adversely impact our margins 
the us and european fiber and textile markets continue to be severely impacted by imports  principally from asian countries 
imports of polyester staple fiber and textile products continue to cause an over supply which decreases polyester staple fiber margins 
the price and volume of imports have and are expected to continue to significantly impact our operating results 
the impact of textile and apparel imports from asia  especially from china  on our textile customers may further increase as all remaining quotas on all textile and apparel imports into the united states were eliminated as of january  pursuant to the gatt now known as the world trade organization agreement uruguay round agreement enacted in our operations are dependent on the availability and cost of our raw materials 
our operations are substantially dependent on the availability and cost of our two primary raw materials  pta and meg  and to a lesser extent our recycled raw materials 
we currently rely on a single producer for our domestic supply of pta and a small number of sources for meg 
the effect of the loss of any producer  a disruption in their businesses or a failure to meet our product needs on a timely basis would depend primarily upon the length of time necessary to find a suitable alternative source 
temporary shortages in needed raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we cannot be sure that the precautions we have taken would be adequate or that an alternative source of supply could be located or developed in a timely manner 
the prices of pta and meg  purchased pursuant to long term contracts  have fluctuated in the past and are expected to fluctuate in the future 
recycled raw materials are purchased from many different suppliers  including some under long term supply contracts 
the prices of recycled raw materials are variable and determined by regional and worldwide supply and demand 
litigation arising out of alleged pricing practices in the polyester staple fiber industry could adversely impact our operating results 
in january  we received a document subpoena in connection with a federal grand jury investigation of pricing practices in the polyester staple fiber industry 
we cooperated with the investigation by producing documents in response to this subpoena 
on september   the department of justice or doj informed us that it will not seek indictments either of wellman or any of its employees in connection with this investigation 
on october   the judge presiding over the federal civil cases discussed below announced on the record that he had been informed by doj that there would be no further criminal prosecution in connection with the investigation 
following the public disclosure of the investigation in september  numerous producers of polyester staple fiber  including wellman  have been named in various civil actions asserting claims based on alleged price fixing and market allocation in the polyester staple industry 
these proceedings are summarized below 
wellman and certain other companies are named as defendants in twenty four federal actions brought by direct purchasers of polyester staple fiber for alleged violation of us antitrust laws 
in each lawsuit  the plaintiffs allege that the defendants engaged in a conspiracy to fix the price of polyester staple fiber in violation of the sherman act 
in ten of the cases  the plaintiff purports to represent a class of all persons who directly purchased polyester staple fiber and were similarly affected by such alleged conduct 
fourteen of the cases are brought by plaintiffs who do not purport to represent a class 
certain of these cases name employees of wellman and other companies as defendants 
all of the federal plaintiffs seek damages of unspecified amounts  attorney s fees and costs and unspecified relief 
in addition  certain of the actions claim restitution  injunction against alleged illegal conduct and other equitable relief 
the federal suits were originally filed in the us district court for the middle district of alabama  us district court for the northern district of california  us district court for the middle district of georgia  us district court for the district of new jersey  us district court for the middle district of north carolina  us district court for the western district of north carolina  us district court for the district of south carolina and us district court for the western district of virginia 
the judicial panel on multi district litigation ruled on april  to transfer all the federal cases to the western district of north carolina for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings 
in addition to the direct purchaser actions discussed above  forty one purported class actions alleging violations of federal antitrust laws  state antitrust or unfair competition laws and certain state consumer protection acts have been filed in one federal court and various state courts on behalf of purported classes of indirect purchasers of polyester staple fiber products 
in each lawsuit  the plaintiffs allege that the defendants engaged in a conspiracy to fix prices of polyester staple fiber products 
in addition  certain of the actions claim restitution  injunction against alleged illegal conduct and other equitable relief 
one indirect purchaser case is pending in the us district court for the western district of north carolina and is subject to the order issued by the judicial panel on multi district litigation for coordination or consolidation with the other federal cases 
the rest of the indirect purchaser cases were filed in arizona  california  the district of columbia  florida  kansas  massachusetts  michigan  new mexico  north carolina  south dakota  tennessee  west virginia and wisconsin 
in all of these cases  the plaintiffs seek damages of unspecified amounts  attorney s fees and costs and unspecified relief 
wellman and certain other companies were named in an action filed in the superior court of justice for ontario  canada  by a plaintiff purporting to represent a class of direct and indirect purchasers of polyester staple fiber 
this complaint asserts claims under canadian law 
it contains three counts that ask for compensatory damages of cdn 
each 
the extent to which these three counts are duplicative and overlapping is unclear 
the complaint also contains one count asking for punitive damages of cdn 
additionally  wellman and certain other companies were also named in an action filed in the supreme court of british columbia  canada  by a plaintiff purporting to represent a class of direct and indirect purchasers of polyester staple fiber 
this complaint also asserts claims under canadian law and requests compensatory  punitive and special damages  but does not allege a specific dollar amount in damages 
finally  wellman and certain other corporations were named in an action filed in the superior court for quebec  canada 
this complaint asserts claims under canadian law seeking compensatory damages of cdn 
and punitive damages of cdn 
we deny that we or any of our employees engaged in price fixing or customer allocation and we intend to vigorously defend against any existing civil claims and any civil claims or proceedings that may be brought against us in the future 
because of the uncertainties and complexity of these civil claims  we have not formed an opinion about these proceedings or their impact  if any  on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in addition to the foregoing  we may become subject to additional proceedings and lawsuits under federal and state antitrust and unfair competition laws 
the actions of our competitors may adversely affect our operating results 
our businesses compete on a variety of factors such as price  product quality  performance or specifications  continuity of supply  customer service and breadth of product line 
major competitors include diversified industrial companies  some of which are larger or have greater financial resources 
changes in a competitor s business behavior may adversely affect our financial performance 
the availability and costs of our financing could adversely affect our operating results 
certain events relating to us or the financial markets could reduce our access to financing and or increase our financing costs 
if current business conditions deteriorate or other events occur that result in a breach of our covenants  our lenders would have the right to cause all of our debt to become due and payable 
if this occurs  there is no certainty the debt could be refinanced and  if it were refinanced  we would probably incur increased costs 
for additional information  see capital resources and liquidity above 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our operating results 
a portion of our operating results occurs in entities where the functional currency is not the us dollar 
when these currencies weaken against the dollar  our profitability and the value of our investment in the foreign subsidiary decreases 
in addition  our foreign subsidiaries conduct business in currencies other than their functional currency 
changes in the relative strength of these currencies can adversely affect the profitability of the foreign subsidiaries in their functional currency 
a portion of the net assets of these subsidiaries is denominated in other than their functional currency 
while we reduce our foreign currency exposure by using appropriate hedges  our foreign subsidiaries still have net assets denominated in currencies other than their functional currency and may experience foreign exchange losses 
as a result  a material change in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our operating results 
regulatory changes may affect the demand for our products 
domestic producers of polyester staple fiber and pet resin produced in the united states and the european union benefit from favorable rules and regulations that affect imports of selected products produced from certain countries 
we have previously described the anti dumping duties on polyester fiberfill imports into the united states from korea and taiwan see continued dumping and subsidy offset act cdo of 
imports of polyester staple fiber into the european union from australia  india  indonesia  korea  belarus and thailand are subject to anti dumping and countervailing duties 
pet resin products imported into the european union from australia  china  india  indonesia  korea  malaysia  taiwan and thailand currently have anti dumping duties and for india  malaysia and thailand  countervailing duties 
pet resin products imported into the united states from thailand  indonesia and india are currently subject to provisional anti dumping duties and for india countervailing duties 
in addition  some of the goods produced using our products benefit from favorable federal and or state regulations 
adverse changes in any of these rules or anti dumping or countervailing determinations could affect the demand and selling price for our products and adversely affect our operating results 
additional liabilities may be proposed by tax authorities 
we have entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of our business 
these initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities 
it is possible that additional liabilities may be proposed by tax authorities as a result of these reviews and that some of the reviews could be resolved unfavorably 
actual costs for environmental matters may vary from the estimates 
actual costs and future estimated costs for identified environmental situations may change 
given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures due to unknown conditions  changing government regulations and legal standards regarding liability and evolving related technologies  we could have higher future environmental expenditures than we have estimated 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk derivative financial instruments we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
for additional discussion of our use of such instruments  see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk because a portion of our debt obligations bear interest at floating rates  our earnings and cash flows are affected by changes in prevailing interest rates 
based on our debt level at december   and the assumption that libor is between and  a basis point increase in libor would result in an annual increase in interest expense of foreign currency risk we use foreign currency debt and foreign currency purchase and sale contracts with terms of less than one year to hedge our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these financial instruments are primarily used to hedge certain accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies 
if foreign currency exchange rates at december  and adversely changed by  the fair value of these financial instruments outstanding at december  and would decline by approximately and  respectively 
however  such loss in fair value would be substantially offset by an increase in the fair value of our underlying exposure 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in any potential changes in any underlying hedged amount or changes in sales levels affected by changes in local currency prices
