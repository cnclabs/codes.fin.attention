item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are a growing independent oil and gas company engaged in acquisition  development and exploration activities in the us gulf coast region 
we are the largest oil and natural gas producer in mississippi  own the largest reserves of carbon dioxide co used for tertiary oil recovery east of the mississippi river  and hold significant operating acreage onshore louisiana and in the barnett shale play in texas 
our goal is to increase the value of acquired properties through a combination of exploitation  drilling  and proven engineering extraction processes  including secondary and tertiary recovery operations 
our corporate headquarters are in plano  texas a suburb of dallas  and we have two primary field offices located in houma  louisiana  and laurel  mississippi 
overview continued expansion of our tertiary operations 
since we acquired our first carbon dioxide tertiary flood in mississippi over five years ago  we have gradually increased our emphasis on these types of operations 
we particularly like this play because of its risk profile  rate of return and lack of competition in our operating area 
generally  from east texas to florida  there are no known significant natural sources of carbon dioxide except our own  and these large volumes of co that we own drive the play 
please refer to the section entitled co operations for further information regarding these operations  their potential  and the ramifications of this change in focus 
during the last few years  we have gradually increased the percentage of our spending dedicated to co and tertiary related operations 
during and  we spent around of our capital budget on tertiary related items  spent approximately during  and we further emphasized this part of our business by budgeting over of our initial capital budget for tertiary operations 
we plan to spend approximately million during on tertiary operations  including an estimated million for an mile pipeline to transport co from our co source fields located near jackson  mississippi to our planned tertiary recovery operations in east mississippi  an expenditure that may ultimately be financed with sources other than our cash flow 
we anticipate that the pipeline will be ready for use during the first half of to commence what we call phase ii operations in east mississippi of our tertiary recovery program see co operations 
phase ii will initially consist of tertiary recovery operations at six oil fields in that region  but we ultimately plan to expand these operations to several other oil fields in the area  which would also be serviced by the new pipeline 
our focus on co tertiary related operations is expected to impact our financial results and certain operating statistics 
see results of operations co operations financial statement impact of co operations below 
during  we drilled four co wells which added an estimated tcf of proved co reserves  resulting in total proved co reserves at december  of approximately tcf tcf to our net ownership see co operations co resources 
we anticipate that year end proved co reserves will be sufficient to satisfy the projected co requirements for our first two tertiary operation phases  phase i  our tertiary operations in southwest mississippi  and phase ii  our recently planned expansion into eastern mississippi 
following the sale of our offshore operations in july  we updated our development schedule and targeted oil production from these tertiary recovery operations 
based on our current plans  we anticipate that we can continue to show significant growth in our oil production from tertiary operations for the next five to ten years from our planned phase i and phase ii operations 
the model assumes that the first production from tertiary recovery operations in eastern mississippi will occur in during  oil production from our tertiary recovery operations averaged  boe d  averaging  boe d during the fourth quarter 
sale of offshore operations 
on july   we closed the sale of denbury offshore  inc  a subsidiary that held our offshore assets  for million before adjustments to newfield exploration company 
the sale price was based on the asset value of the offshore assets as of april   which means that the net operating cash flow defined as revenue less operating expenses and capital expenditures from these properties which we received between april st and closing  as well as expenses of the sale and other contractual adjustments  reduced the purchase price to approximately million 
the purchaser also received the net working capital of denbury offshore as of the closing date  which primarily consisted of accrued production receivables 
denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we excluded two significant items from the sale i a discovery well drilled at high island a during and ii certain deep rights at west delta the well at high island a should be on production during the first half of  and we sold a substantial portion of the deep rights at west delta during the third quarter of for million but retained a carried interest in a deep exploratory well 
our offshore properties made up approximately of our year end proved reserves approximately bcfe as of december  and represented approximately  boe d of our second quarter production 
operating results 
as a result of the sale of our offshore properties early in the third quarter of  our total production was significantly reduced  contributing to a decline in production levels during as compared to levels 
however  higher commodity prices more than offset the lower production  resulting in net income of million during as compared to million of net income during the increase in adjusted cash flow from operations during was less significant primarily due to the million of income taxes paid relating to the sale of our offshore properties 
see results of operations operating income for discussion of this non gaap measure versus cash flow from operations  which decreased by between the two periods 
payments on our commodity hedges continued to be a significant outflow  totaling million for  up from million during hedge payments should drop significantly during as most of our out of the money hedges expired at december  see results of operations for a more thorough discussion of our operating results and market risk management for more information regarding our hedge position at year end and our new method of accounting for hedges for capital resources and liquidity for  our initial capital budget  excluding any potential acquisitions  is million  which at commodity futures prices as of the end of february will be slightly more than anticipated cash flow from operations 
that budget includes an estimated million for a co pipeline being constructed to east mississippi see expansion of our tertiary operations under overview above  which we may refinance upon completion by entering into some sort of long term financing  effectively paying for the cost of the pipeline over time and recouping the cash spent 
we monitor our capital expenditures on a regular basis  adjusting them up or down depending on commodity prices and the resultant cash flow 
therefore  during the last few years as commodity prices have increased  we have often increased our capital budget during the year and would likely do so again if commodity prices remain strong or increase further 
at year end  we had approximately million in cash and short term investments remaining from the sale of our offshore properties  over and above our normal month end cash balances 
we plan to invest this remaining cash and any cash potentially generated from operations in excess of our capital budget such amount being highly dependent on commodity prices over the next one to two years on property acquisitions  particularly those that have future tertiary potential 
although we now control most of the fields along our existing co pipeline  there are several fields in east mississippi that could be acquired to expand our planned tertiary operations there  plus we are continuing to seek additional interests in the fields that we currently own 
further  we would like to add additional phases or areas of tertiary operations by acquiring other old oil fields in other parts of our region of operations  building a co pipeline to those areas and initiating additional tertiary floods 
we accelerated the pace and expenditures on our tertiary operations following the offshore sale  and plan to continue to do so as long as it remains economic and practical 
we also may seek conventional development and exploration projects in our areas of operations or tertiary operations in other areas of the country 
in addition to our cash and short term investments which may be used for the potential aforementioned projects  we have all of our bank credit line available to us if we were to need additional capital 
at december   we had outstanding million principal amount of subordinated notes due in  approximately million of capital lease commitments  no bank debt  and working capital of million 
on september   we amended and restated our bank credit agreement which modified the prior agreement by i creating a structure wherein the commitment amount and borrowing base amount are no longer the same  ii improving our credit pricing by reducing the interest rate chargeable at certain levels of borrowing  iii extending the term by three years to april   iv reducing the collateral requirements  v authorizing up to million of possible future co volumetric production payment transactions with genesis energy million of such transactions occurred in october  and vi other minor modifications and corrections 
under the new agreement  our borrowing base was initially set at million  a million increase over the prior borrowing base of million  with an initial commitment amount of million 
the borrowing base represents the amount we can borrow from a credit standpoint based on our assets  as confirmed by the banks  while the commitment amount is the amount we have asked the banks to commit to fund pursuant to the terms of denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the credit agreement 
the banks have the option to participate in any borrowing request made by us in excess of the commitment amount  up to the borrowing base limit  although they are not obligated to fund any amount in excess of million  the commitment amount 
the advantage to us is that we will pay commitment fees on the lower commitment amount  not the higher borrowing base  thus lowering our overall cost of available credit 
sources and uses of capital resources during  we spent million on oil and natural gas exploration and development expenditures  million on co exploration and development expenditures  and approximately million on property acquisitions  for total capital expenditures of approximately million 
our exploration and development expenditures included approximately million spent on drilling  million of geological  geophysical and acreage expenditures and million spent on facilities and recompletion costs 
we funded these expenditures with million of cash flow from operations  with the balance funded with net proceeds from the sale of our offshore properties 
we paid back all of our bank debt during the third quarter of with the offshore sale proceeds  leaving us with approximately million of cash and million of short term investments as of december  we also raised million during the third quarter of from the sale of another volumetric production payment of co to genesis energy  lp genesis  along with a related long term co supply agreement with an industrial customer 
adjusted cash flow from operations a non gaap measure defined as cash flow from operations before changes in assets and liabilities as discussed below under results of operations operating results was million for  while cash flow from operations  the gaap measure  was million 
during  we generated approximately million of cash flow from operations and generated an additional million of cash from sales of oil and gas properties 
the largest single asset sale was the sale of laurel field  acquired from coho in august  which netted us approximately million 
later in the year  we also sold a volumetric production payment to genesis  which netted us approximately million of cash 
during  we spent million on oil and natural gas exploration and development expenditures  million on co capital investments and acquisitions  and approximately million on oil and natural gas property acquisitions  for total capital expenditures of approximately million 
our exploration and development expenditures included approximately million spent on drilling  million of geological  geophysical and acreage expenditures and million spent on facilities and recompletion costs 
in addition  during we incurred approximately million of costs for our subordinated debt refinancing 
the million of net total expenditures including the million of debt refinancing costs but net of property sales proceeds was funded by our cash flow from operations  with the balance used to reduce our total debt by approximately million 
during  we spent approximately million on exploration and development activities  approximately million on acquisitions the largest being the million acquisition of the coho properties  and approximately million on co related capital expenditures  for a total of approximately million 
our exploration and development expenditures included approximately million spent on drilling  million of geological  geophysical and acreage expenditures and million spent on facilities and recompletion costs 
the exploration and development expenditures were funded by cash flow from operations  and the acquisitions were primarily funded by cash flow  supplemented by property dispositions totaling million and incremental bank debt for the year of million 
off balance sheet arrangements commitments and obligations we have no off balance sheet arrangements  special purpose entities  financing partnerships or guarantees  other than as disclosed in this section 
we have no debt or equity triggers based upon our stock or commodity prices 
our dollar denominated obligations that are not on our balance sheet include our operating leases  which at year end totaled million relating primarily to the lease financing of certain equipment for our co recycling facilities at our tertiary oil fields 
we also have several leases relating to office space and other minor equipment leases 
we also have dollar related denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations obligations that are not currently recorded on our balance sheet relating to various obligations for development and exploratory expenditures that arise from our normal capital expenditure program or from other transactions common to our industry 
in addition  in order to recover our undeveloped proved reserves  we must also fund the associated future development costs forecasted in our proved reserve reports 
for a further discussion of our future development costs and proved reserves  see results of operations depletion  depreciation and amortization 
at december   we had a total of  outstanding in letters of credit 
genesis energy  inc  our owned subsidiary which is the general partner of genesis  has guaranteed the bank debt of genesis  which consists of million of debt and million in letters of credit at december  there were no guarantees by denbury or any of its other subsidiaries of the debt of genesis or of genesis energy  inc at december  we do not have any material transactions with related parties other than sales of production and transportation arrangements with genesis made in the ordinary course of business  and volumetric production payments of co vpp sold to genesis as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements

the table assumes that our long term debt is held until maturity 
b represents future minimum cash commitments under capital leases in place at december   primarily for transportation of crude oil and co agreements are with genesis 
approximately million of these payments represents interest 
c represents future minimum cash commitments under contracts in place as of december   primarily for drilling rig services and well related costs 
as is common in our industry  we commit to make certain expenditures on a regular basis as part of our ongoing development and exploration program 
these commitments generally relate to projects that occur during the subsequent several months and are usually part of our normal operating expenses or part of our capital budget  which for is currently set at million including the co pipeline 
in addition  we have recurring expenditures for such things as accounting  engineering and legal fees  software maintenance  subscriptions  and other overhead type items 
normally these expenditures do not change materially on an aggregate basis from year to year and are part of our general and administrative expenses 
we have not attempted to estimate these types of expenditures in this table as most could be quickly cancelled with regard to any specific vendor  even though the expense itself may be required for ongoing normal operations of the company 
d represents the estimated future payments under our derivative obligations based on the futures market prices as of december  these amounts will change as oil and natural gas commodity prices change

long term contracts require us to deliver co to our industrial co customers at various contracted prices  plus we have a co delivery obligation to genesis pursuant to two volumetric production payments vpp contracts entered into during and based upon the maximum amounts deliverable as stated in the contracts and the volumetric production payment  we estimate that we may be obligated to deliver up to bcf of co to these customers over the next years  however  since the group as a whole has historically taken less co than the maximum allowed in their contracts  based on the current level of deliveries we project that our commitment would likely be reduced to approximately bcf 
the maximum volume required in any given year is approximately mmcf d  although based on our current level of deliveries  this would likely be reduced to approximately mmcf d 
given the size of our proven co reserves at december  approximately tcf before deducting approximately bcf for the two vpps  our current production capabilities and our projected levels of co usage for our own tertiary flooding program  we believe that we will be able to meet these delivery obligations 
results of operations co operations overview 
over five years ago we began our focus upon tertiary operations with the purchase of little creek field  a tertiary recovery operation that was already underway 
subsequently  we have greatly expanded this program in southwest mississippi phase i of our tertiary operations  acquiring several more oil fields and most importantly the co resources used to flood these fields see co resources below 
the focus has increased to the point that approximately of our capital budget is dedicated to tertiary related operations  including the co pipeline currently under construction to east mississippi the area where we will conduct phase ii of our tertiary operations 
we particularly like this play as i it is lower risk and more predictable than most traditional exploration and development activities  ii it provides a reasonable rate of return at relatively low oil prices down to prices in the low twenties per bbl in phase i of our tertiary operations in southwest mississippi  and iii we have virtually no competition for this type of activity in our geographic area 
generally  from east texas to florida  there are no known significant natural sources of carbon dioxide except our own  and these large volumes of co that we own drive the play 
co resources 
in february  we acquired the sources of co located near jackson  mississippi  and a pipeline to transport it to our oil fields 
since february  we have acquired two producing wells and drilled seven co producing wells  tripling our initial proven co reserves to tcf as of december  including the bcf of reserves dedicated to two vpps with genesis 
the estimate of tcf of proved co reserves is based on total co reserves in the fields  of which denbury s net ownership is approximately tcf and is included in the evaluation of proven co reserves by degolyer macnaughton included as exhibit in discussing the available co reserves  we make reference to the gross amount of proved reserves as that is the amount that is available both for denbury s tertiary recovery programs and for industrial users who are customers of denbury and others  as we are responsible for distributing the entire co production stream for both of these purposes 
we currently estimate that it will take approximately bcf of co to develop and produce the proved tertiary recovery reserves we have recorded at december  today  we own every known producing co well in the region  providing us a significant strategic advantage in the acquisition of other properties in mississippi and louisiana that could be further exploited through tertiary recovery 
as of january  we are capable of producing approximately mmcf d of co  about four times the production capacity at the time of our initial acquisition of the jackson dome field 
we continue to drill additional co wells  with four more wells planned for  which are expected to further increase our production capacity and potentially increase our proven co reserves 
we believe we have sufficient co reserves for our first two phases of tertiary operations in western mississippi and eastern mississippi  but would like to add additional reserves for future phases  plus we need to further increase our production capacity as our current model for phases i and ii requires almost mmcf d of co production by although we believe that our plans and projections are reasonable and achievable  there could be delays or unforeseen problems in the future which could delay our overall tertiary development program 
we believe that such delays  if any  should only be temporary 
in addition to using co for our tertiary operations  we sell co to third party industrial users under long term contracts 
our net operating margin from denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations these sales was million during  million during  and million during our average co production during  and was approximately million  million  and million cubic feet per day  of which approximately in  in  and in was used in our tertiary recovery operations  with the balance sold to third parties for industrial use 
we spent approximately per mcf to produce our co during  slightly less than our annual average of per mcf  primarily due to the lack of any significant workover expenses like we had in  partially offset by higher royalty expenses because certain of our royalties are adjusted based on oil prices 
during  we spent approximately per mcf to produce our co our estimated total cost per thousand cubic feet of co during was approximately  after inclusion of depreciation and amortization expense related to the co production 
oil potential 
although our oil production from our co tertiary recovery activities is still relatively modest approximately of fourth quarter production  we expect it to be an ever increasing portion of our production 
we currently have tertiary operations on going at little creek  mallalieu  mccomb and brookhaven fields  as well as various smaller adjacent fields 
we project that our oil production from these operations will increase substantially over the next several years  along with our tentatively scheduled tertiary projects at other oil fields along our pipeline 
as of january  these fields were producing approximately  bbls d 
as of december   we had approximately mmbbls of proven oil reserves related to tertiary operations in these fields along our co pipeline and have identified and estimated significant additional potential in fields that we own in this area 
in addition  we have commenced operations to expand this program to east mississippi and have commenced the acquisition of leases and right of way for the construction of an mile co pipeline from our source wells near jackson  mississippi to eucutta field in east mississippi 
while our current tertiary operations in the southwest part of mississippi are economic at nymex per barrel oil prices in the low twenties  due predominately to the lower quality of oil in east mississippi  we estimate that it requires a nymex oil price in the mid to upper twenties for the same rate of return in this part of the state 
we believe that this expansion  labeled phase ii  has significant other oil potential well beyond the first six fields that we have engineered and currently plan to flood 
combining the production forecast for both of these areas extends the period during which we anticipate significant oil production growth from a few years  for phase i alone  to five to ten years combined 
while it is extremely difficult to accurately forecast production  we do believe that our tertiary recovery operations provide significant long term production growth potential at reasonable rates of return with relatively low risk and will be the backbone of our company s growth for the foreseeable future 
financial statement impact of co operations 
the increasing emphasis on co tertiary recovery projects has made  and will continue to make  an impact on our financial results and certain operating statistics different from conventional development activities 
first  there is a significant delay between the initial capital expenditures and the resulting production increases  as these tertiary operations require the building of facilities before co flooding can commence and it usually takes six to twelve months before the field responds ie oil production commences to the injection of co further  as we expand to other areas beyond phase i  there will be times when we spend significant amounts of capital before we can recognize any proven reserves as these other areas  for the most part  will require an oil production response to the co injections before any oil reserves can be recorded 
we plan to spend over million on phase ii oil fields during  plus an additional million on the co pipeline to east mississippi 
secondly  these tertiary projects are more expensive to operate than our other oil fields because of the cost of injecting and recycling the co primarily due to the significant energy requirements to re compress the co back into a liquid state for re injection purposes 
as commodity and energy prices increase  so does our operating expenses in these fields 
as such  our overall operating expenses on a per boe basis will likely continue to increase as these operations constitute an increasingly larger percentage of our operations 
our operating cost for our tertiary operations during averaged per boe  as compared to an estimated cost of around to per boe for a more traditional oil property 
we allocate the cost to produce and transport the co between co used in our own oil fields and co sold to commercial users 
the co operating expenses allocated to our oil fields are recorded as lease operating expenses on those fields 
third  all of our current co operations are in fields that produce light sweet oil and receive oil prices close to  and sometimes actually higher than  nymex prices 
as this production becomes a larger percentage of our overall production  the overall average difference between the prices we receive and published nymex prices should decrease  assuming other market conditions do not denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations change 
while our oil prices have historically averaged between and below nymex prices  our average was below nymex and our average decreased further to below nymex 
during  the market for sour and heavy crude oil predominately our east mississippi production deteriorated  causing our overall average differential to increase to per barrel for the year and to per barrel for the fourth quarter of while we cannot predict what will happen to the market for heavy and sour crude  we do expect our light sweet oil production to increase as a percentage of our total oil production over the next few years 
however  this trend could reverse in future years as the anticipated oil production from phase ii of our tertiary operations is primarily heavy and sour oil 
co tertiary recovery operating activities 
our oil production from our co tertiary recovery activities has steadily increased during the last few years  from  bbls d in to  bbls d during  and to  bbls d during  with a fourth quarter rate of  bbls d 
this represents approximately of our total corporate oil production during the fourth quarter of and approximately of our total corporate production on a boe basis 
we expect that this oil production will continue to increase  although the increases are not always predictable or consistent 
while we did experience higher energy costs to operate our tertiary recycling facilities as a result of higher commodity prices  we were able to lower our operating cost per boe in our tertiary operations from per boe in to per boe during because of the higher tertiary oil production levels 
in addition to higher energy costs  we experienced general cost inflation in the industry and also commenced lease payments on certain of our recycling facilities see commitments and obligations above 
as a result  the absolute amount of operating expenses related to tertiary operations increased from million during to million during and million during at december   we had proved reserves of mmbbls relating to our tertiary recovery operations 
through december   we had spent a total of million on fields involved in this process  and had received million in net cash flow revenue less operating expenses and capital expenditures  or net positive cash flow of million 
the proved oil reserves in our co fields have a pv value of million  using december  constant nymex pricing of per bbl 
these amounts do not include the capital costs or related depreciation and amortization of our co producing properties 
through december   we have spent a total of million on our co producing properties  received a total of million in net cash flow revenue less operating expenses and capital expenditures  consisting solely of sales to industrial customers and genesis volumetric production payment receipts  leaving us a balance of approximately million of unrecovered costs for the co assets 
co related capital budget for tentatively  we plan to spend approximately million in in the jackson dome area with the intent to add additional co reserves and deliverability for future operations 
approximately million in capital expenditures is budgeted in for our oil fields with tertiary operations in southwest mississippi and approximately million for oil fields in east mississippi  plus an additional million for the co pipeline to east mississippi  increasing our combined co related expenditures to over of our capital budget 
operating income cash flow from operations and net income have been strong for the last three years  primarily because of higher than historical commodity prices 
production declined slightly from to and approximately from to  with most of the current year decrease related to the sale of our offshore properties see also overview 
the higher commodity prices each year more than offset the production decline  resulting in higher overall net income and adjusted cash flow from operations each year from through see discussion below regarding this non gaap measure  adjusted cash flow from operations 
year ended december  amounts in thousands except per share amounts net income    net income per common share basic diluted adjusted cash flow from operations    net change in assets and liabilities relating to operations 
   cash flow from operations gaap measure    denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations adjusted cash flow from operations is a non gaap measure that represents cash flow provided by operations before changes in assets and liabilities  as calculated from our consolidated statements of cash flows 
cash flow from operations is the gaap measure as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
in our discussion herein  we have elected to discuss these two components of cash flow provided by operations 
adjusted cash flow from operations  the non gaap measure  measures the cash flow earned or incurred from operating activities without regard to the collection or payment of associated receivables or payables 
we believe that it is important to consider adjusted cash flow from operations separately  as we believe it can often be a better way to discuss changes in operating trends in our business caused by changes in production  prices  operating costs  and related operational factors  without regard to whether the earned or incurred item was collected or paid during that year 
we also use this measure because the collection of our receivables or payment of our obligations has not been a significant issue for our business  but merely a timing issue from one period to the next  with fluctuations generally caused by significant changes in commodity prices or significant changes in drilling activity 
the net change in assets and liabilities relating to operations is also important as it does require or provide additional cash for use in our business  however  we prefer to discuss its effect separately 
for instance  as noted above  during  our accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased as a result of our higher drilling activity level late in the year  particularly offshore  increasing our available cash from operations 
during  we had a million difference between our adjusted cash flow from operations and our gaap cash flow from operations 
the most significant factor was the transfer of approximately million of accrued production receivables relating to our offshore properties that existed as of the closing date to the offshore property purchaser 
this reduction in accrued production receivables during was not considered a collection of receivables for our gaap cash flow from operations 
in addition to the effect of transferred receivables  our other accrued production receivables increased during the year due to the increase in commodity prices and we reduced our accounts payable and accrued liabilities by approximately million  as a result of less overall activity as of year end  both of which contributed to the significant difference between our adjusted cash flow and gaap cash flow from operations

average daily production by area for  and  and each of the quarters of is listed in the following table boe d

offshore        offshore gulf of mexico       total company        as a result of the sale of our offshore properties in july  third and fourth quarter production decreased significantly from prior periods as listed in the above table 
adjusting for the offshore sale  overall production increased approximately on a boe d basis during both and  anchored by the increased production from our tertiary operations and barnett shale play  generally offset by overall declines in our onshore natural gas wells in louisiana 
however  other factors that caused fluctuations between the various periods should also be noted as outlined below 
the addition of properties acquired from coho during august contributed to the majority of the increase in our overall production in the mississippi non co flood properties from to  as most of these pre existing non co fields in mississippi have been on a slow decline as a result of normal depletion 
heidelberg field  our single largest field that is located in this area  has partially offset this decline  as its production increased each year  from  boe d during to  boe d during to  boe d during most of this increase at heidelberg is attributable to additional natural gas drilling in the selma chalk formation as heidelberg s oil production has been slowly decreasing 
natural gas production at this field averaged mmcf d in  mmcf d in and mmcf d in  making heidelberg field our single largest natural gas producing field during as more fully discussed in co operations above  oil production from our tertiary operations has increased each year 
production from our offshore properties averaged  boe d in the third quarter  representing the production during the first days of july prior to the sale 
as evidenced in the above table  production from this area has fluctuated over the last three years primarily due to the level of activity and the fluctuations caused by the short lived nature of these natural gas reserves 
as an example  offshore production increased in early as a result of well completions made late in the fourth quarter of  four at brazos a  three at north padre a  three at chandeleur sound  two at west cameron and three at west cameron some of our natural gas properties in onshore louisiana have similar characteristics as is evident by the steep declines during while the production from onshore louisiana only declined on an annual basis  there was a drop between the first quarter of and last quarter of a significant portion of this decline was at thornwell field  an onshore louisiana field  which averaged boe d during the fourth quarter of  down from  boe d in the first quarter of and  boe d during production from this field is in a steep decline due to its short lived nature  and is expected to further decline in the future 
in spite of its short remaining life  we have generated a good return on investment at thornwell  generating million of net positive cash flow operating revenues less operating expenses and capital expenditures through december   with a remaining pv value of million as of december  based on sec proved reserve report at year end prices 
denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations production in the barnett shale area has just recently begun to increase as a result of five horizontal wells drilled and completed in this area during the latter part of we plan to drill around more wells there in and expect production from this area to further increase during our production for was weighted slightly toward oil  although the fourth quarter average was oil following the sale of the offshore properties in july it appears that we will remain similarly weighted toward oil in due to our increasing emphasis on tertiary operations  unless we make an acquisition that is predominantly natural gas 
oil and natural gas revenues 
our oil and natural gas revenues have increased for each of the last two years 
two factors cause the change in pre hedging revenues commodity prices and production levels 
between and  revenues increased by  primarily due to higher commodity prices 
the overall increase in commodity prices contributed million in additional revenues  a increase  partially offset by an overall decrease of million a decrease related to the lower production volumes 
between and  revenues increased by  also primarily due to higher commodity prices 
the overall increase in commodity prices contributed million in additional revenues  a increase  partially offset by an overall decrease in revenues of million a decrease related to the lower production volumes 
during  we paid out million on our oil hedges per bbl and million per mcf on our natural gas hedges relating to swaps and collars we purchased one to two years earlier when commodity prices were lower 
about million of the hedge payments related to swaps originally put in place to protect the rate of return for the coho acquisition in august the payments in were similar in nature  but slightly less due to lower overall commodity prices 
during  we paid out million on our oil hedges per bbl and million per mcf on our natural gas hedges on generally the same swaps and collars 
during  we had total net receipts on our hedges of  paying out million per bbl on our oil hedges  but collecting a net million per mcf on our natural gas hedges 
for  we have hedged a lower percentage of our overall production  predominately with puts or price floors  so we anticipate that our hedge payments will be substantially lower than the payments made in see market risk management for a further discussion of our hedging activities and position 
our net oil and natural gas prices have fluctuated as outlined on the prior table 
during  we received the highest weighted average net price per boe in our history  netting per boe even after paying out approximately per boe for hedge losses 
this resulted from average nymex prices of over per bbl and per mmbtu during the year 
prices were also strong during  although not quite as high  netting denbury per boe  net of the per boe hedge losses 
during we also had one of our best years with regard to our realized net price relative to nymex prices 
during  we received an average discount to nymex of per bbl 
this improved in to an average discount of per bbl 
this trend was reversed in as the heavy  sour crude market which predominately applies to our eastern mississippi production deteriorated significantly  increasing our average oil differentials for the year to per bbl and per bbl for the fourth quarter of if market conditions for the heavy  sour crude remained consistent  we would expect to gradually improve the overall nymex discount as the amount of light sweet oil production from our tertiary operations is expected to increase  improving the overall quality of our product mix 
however  as evident in  the oil market can change substantially 
year over year  there is generally less fluctuation in our natural gas prices relative to nymex 
normally  we are at  or slightly above  the nymex market  primarily because of the high btu content of our natural gas 
for  we had an average premium to nymex  a little less than the premium during  but higher than the discount in as we increase our emphasis on the barnett shale area in  the overall price we receive for our natural gas could decline slightly as our properties in this area have historically received a price that is to less than nymex prices 
operating expenses 
lease operating expenses increased to per boe in  a increase over the per boe average during  and an increase of from the per boe average during during  our workover expenses decreased as compared to  when we spent million on two individually significant workovers relating to mechanical failures of two onshore louisiana wells  plus several smaller workovers 
operating expenses on our tertiary operations increased from million during to million in to million in as a result of increased activity at mallalieu and mccomb fields 
however  with the higher production from these tertiary operations between the same periods  operating expenses for our tertiary operations on a per boe basis decreased from per boe in to per boe in nonetheless  our tertiary operations are steadily increasing our aggregate dollar costs and our costs per boe on a total corporate denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations basis as our tertiary operations constitute a more significant portion of our total production and operations 
the balance of cost increases during is generally attributable to higher energy costs to operate our tertiary recovery properties  a provision for potential litigation losses  and general cost inflation in our industry 
in general  we expect our operating costs per boe to further increase in the future as the operating costs of our tertiary operations are higher than the costs of our other operations 
most of the increase from to was attributable to the aforementioned workovers  with several other smaller workovers  including one on a co well 
the growth of our tertiary operations also contributed to an overall increase  as well as higher lease fuel costs and a full year of expenses on the properties acquired from coho  which have typically had higher expenses on a per boe basis than our other oil properties due to their age 
production taxes and marketing expenses generally change in proportion to commodity prices and therefore  were higher in along with the record high commodity prices 
the sale of our offshore properties also contributed to the increase in production taxes and marketing expenses on a per boe basis during  as most of our offshore properties were tax exempt 
general and administrative expenses during the last three years  general and administrative g a expenses on a per boe basis have increased from per boe during  to per boe during  to per boe during  increasing even faster than the gross aggregate dollar increases in g a expense as production has declined each year due primarily to property sales 
year ended december  amounts in thousands except per boe and employee data gross g a expense    operator overhead charges    capitalized exploration expense    state franchise taxes   net g a expense    average g a expense per boe employees as of december gross g a expenses increased million  or  between and the largest component of the increase was approximately million of employee severance payments for the offshore professional and technical staff terminated in conjunction with our offshore property sale 
we also incurred additional g a expenses associated with our corporate restructuring in december  compliance with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act  the sale of stock by the texas pacific group in march  a provision for potential litigation losses  restricted stock grants  higher bonus levels for employees than in due to the strong performance during  and overall increases in most other categories of g a due to general cost inflation 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we granted a total of  million shares of restricted stock to our officers and independent directors  generating deferred compensation expense of approximately million  the market value of the shares on the date of grant 
a portion of this restricted stock vests over five years and a smaller portion vests upon retirement in addition to vesting upon death  disability or a change of control 
we are amortizing the non cash million of compensation expense of this restricted stock over the five year vesting period and over the projected retirement date vesting period  expensing approximately million during we estimate that amortized compensation expense for the restricted stock will be approximately million per quarter through gross aggregate dollar g a expenses increased million  or  between and the largest component of the increase was approximately million of expenses spent for consultants hired to help document and test our system of internal controls  a requirement of the sarbanes oxley act of the second largest source of the increase was approximately  of legal  accounting  bank and other fees associated with the conversion to a holding denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company organizational structure during december which reduced our franchise taxes by  between and other factors also contributed to the increase  the most significant being expenses associated with the sale of stock by the texas pacific group in the first and last quarters of  higher year end expenses for engineering and audit fees  and an overall increase in personnel and associated expenses primarily related to cost of living salary increases 
partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in our bonuses due to less positive operating results during in certain areas 
higher operator overhead recovery charges resulting from the incremental development activity helped to partially offset the increase in gross g a  partially reduced by the impact of the offshore property sale 
our well operating agreements allow us  when we are the operator  to charge a well with a specified overhead rate during the drilling phase and also to charge a monthly fixed overhead rate for each producing well 
as a result of the additional operated wells from acquisitions  additional tertiary operations  and drilling activity during the past year  the amount we recovered as operator overhead charges increased by between and and between and capitalized exploration costs increased slightly between and  along with increases in employee related costs  but decreased in as a result of the personnel reductions in our offshore area as a result of the property sale 
the net effect of the increases in gross g a expenses  operator overhead recoveries and capitalized exploration costs was a increase in net g a expense between and and a increase between and the increase was even higher on a per boe basis as a result of lower production  primarily related to the offshore property sale

interest expense for decreased from primarily due to lower average debt levels as a result of our million reduction in debt during and the payoff of our bank debt in the third quarter of with the proceeds from our offshore property sale 
our non cash interest expense in decreased as a result of the subordinated debt refinancing in march  which eliminated the amortization of discount on our old subordinated debt  which was higher than the discount and related amortization on our new subordinated debt issue 
interest and other income increased as a result of the cash generated from the offshore property sale 
interest expense for decreased from levels in the prior year for similar reasons  i lower overall interest rates  resulting from an overall drop in market interest rates on our bank debt and due to the refinancing of our subordinated debt  ii lower average outstanding debt balance during  as we reduced debt by million during the year  and iii reduced debt issue cost amortization resulting from the complete amortization of costs associated with the original maturity of our bank credit line in december after we refinanced and extended the bank credit line to april denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations depletion  depreciation and amortization dd a year ended december  amounts in thousands  except per boe data depletion and depreciation of oil and natural gas properties    depletion and depreciation of co assets    asset retirement obligations    depreciation of other fixed assets    total dd a    dd a per boe oil and natural gas properties co assets and other fixed assets total dd a cost per boe but for the property sales  our total proved reserve quantities would have increased each of the last three years 
our proved reserves decreased from mmboe as of december   to mmboe as of december  and increased slightly to mmboe as of december  during we sold approximately mmboe of proved reserves and during sold approximately mmboe of proved reserves  primarily related to the offshore sale 
reserve quantities and associated production are only one side of the dd a equation  with capital expenditures  asset retirement obligations less related salvage value  and projected future development costs making up the remainder of the calculation 
in total  our dd a rate on a per boe basis increased between and  primarily due to the higher percentage of expenditures on offshore properties during and the first six months of  which have higher overall finding and development costs  and an increase in certain of our future development cost estimates to reflect the rising costs in the industry 
although the average dd a rate was similar to the dd a rate of per boe during the fourth quarter of  during the year there were significant fluctuations 
our dd a rate on a per boe basis decreased in the third quarter of to per boe from per boe in the second quarter  primarily as a result of the sale of our offshore properties  the proceeds of which were credited to the full cost pool 
however  the rate increased in the fourth quarter of to per boe  primarily to reflect cost inflation in the industry  as we increased our cost estimates ie future development costs for certain existing proved undeveloped reserves 
we adjust our dd a rate each quarter based on any changes in our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and costs  and thus our dd a rate could change significantly in the future 
our dd a rate for our co and other fixed assets increased in as a result of the additional cost incurred drilling co wells during the year and higher associated future development costs  partially offset by an increase in co reserves from tcf as of december  to tcf as of december  working interest basis before amounts attributable to genesis volumetric production payments see co operations co resources 
during  the fourth quarter dd a rate increased to per boe  increasing the annual average to per boe 
the higher dd a was partially due to the higher percentage of capital expenditures spent on our offshore properties  during as compared to approximately during  where we have a higher overall finding cost 
the rate was also affected by less than hoped for drilling results in the gulf of mexico and southern louisiana  particularly in the fourth quarter  where some of our larger exploration potential failed to materialize 
in contrast to our offshore properties  our tertiary operations have yielded a finding and development cost  including the net change in forecasted future development and abandonment costs  of just under per boe inception to december   in line with our long term expectations  helping to partially offset the higher finding and development cost of our offshore and other natural gas properties 
prior to  we provided for the estimated future costs of well abandonment and site reclamation  net of any anticipated salvage  on a unit of production basis 
this provision was included in dd a expense and increased each year  along with a general increase in the number of our properties  especially the acquisition of our offshore properties 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred  discounted to its present value using our credit adjusted risk free interest rate  and that a corresponding amount be capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations long lived asset 
the liability is accreted each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount  the difference is recorded to the full cost pool  unless significant 
as part of this adoption  we ceased accruing for site reclamation costs  as had been our practice in the past  and recorded a million liability representing the estimated present value of our retirement obligations  with a million increase to oil and natural gas properties 
on an undiscounted basis  we estimated our retirement obligations as of december  to be million  with an estimated salvage value of million  also on an undiscounted basis 
as of december   we estimated our retirement obligations to be million million present value  with an estimate salvage value of million  the decrease related to the sale of our offshore properties 
dd a is calculated on the increase to oil and natural gas and co properties  net of estimated salvage value 
we also include the accretion of discount on the asset retirement obligation in our dd a expense 
under full cost accounting rules  we are required each quarter to perform a ceiling test calculation 
we did not have any full cost pool ceiling test write downs in  or and do not expect to have any such write downs in the foreseeable future at current commodity price levels 
income taxes year ended december  amounts in thousands  except per boe amounts current income tax expense benefit  defered income tax provision    total income tax provision    average income tax provision per boe net effective tax rate federal tax net operating loss carryforwards   total net deferred tax asset liability    our income tax provision for was increased to an estimated statutory tax rate of to reflect the changes in our state income tax rates resulting from the sale of our offshore properties 
our tax provision for and was based on an estimated statutory rate of 
our net effective tax rate for all periods was lower than the statutory rates  primarily due to the recognition of enhanced oil recovery credits which lowered our overall tax rate 
the current income tax expense represents our anticipated alternative minimum cash taxes that we could not offset with our regular tax net operating loss carryforwards or our enhanced oil recovery credits 
during the third quarter of  we recognized approximately million of current income taxes as a result of the sale of our offshore properties  which was a gain for income tax purposes 
the taxes on the offshore sale were primarily alternative minimum taxes as we were able to offset the related regular tax with our net operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   we had utilized all of our federal tax net operating loss carryforwards  but had an estimated million of enhanced oil recovery credits to carryforward 
since the ability to earn additional enhanced oil recovery credits is reduced or even eliminated based on the level of oil prices  our effective tax rate and cash taxes could both increase in the future if oil prices remain at current levels or increase further 
our overall current income tax credit for was the result of a tax law change that allowed us to offset of our alternative minimum taxes with our alternative minimum tax net operating loss carryforwards 
prior to the law change  we were able to offset only of our alternative minimum taxes with these carryforwards 
this change resulted in a refund of cash taxes paid for and a reclassification of tax expense between current and deferred taxes  but did not impact our overall effective tax rate

we enter into various financial contracts to hedge our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future oil and natural gas production 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
these contracts have historically consisted of price floors  collars and fixed price swaps 
historically  we have generally attempted to hedge between and of our anticipated production each year to provide us with a reasonably certain amount of cash flow to cover most of our budgeted exploration and development expenditures without incurring significant debt  although our hedging percentage may vary relative to our debt levels 
for and beyond  we have hedged significantly less  primarily because of our strong financial position resulted from our lower levels of debt relative to our cash flow from operations 
when we make a significant acquisition  we generally attempt to hedge a large percentage  up to  of the forecasted proved production for the subsequent one to three years following the acquisition in order to help provide us with a minimum return on our investment 
much of our historical hedging activity has been done with collars  although for the coho acquisition  we also used swaps in order to lock in the prices used in our economic forecasts 
for  all of our oil hedges are puts or price floors  allowing us to retain any price upside  while still providing protection in the event of lower prices at a fixed and determinable price ie the cost of the put 
we anticipate using more price floors in the future 
all of the mark to market valuations used for our financial derivatives are provided by external sources and are based on prices that are actively quoted 
we manage and control market and counterparty credit risk through established internal control procedures denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are reviewed on an ongoing basis 
we attempt to minimize credit risk exposure to counterparties through formal credit policies  monitoring procedures  and diversification 
for a full description of our hedging position at year end  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
upon reaching a verbal agreement with the purchaser newfield exploration company of our offshore properties  subject primarily to their further due diligence  we entered into natural gas swaps on a total of bcf for the period of july through december  covering the anticipated natural gas production from our offshore properties for that period  with the tacit understanding with the prospective purchaser that these hedges would be transferred to them upon closing 
these swaps did not qualify for hedge accounting and during the third quarter of  we assigned them to newfield 
during the period that we owned them  we recognized approximately million of gain as the hedges appreciated in value before we assigned them to newfield 
at about the same time  with the expectation that the offshore transaction would be consummated  we retired  by purchasing offsetting contracts  mmcf d of our natural gas hedges for july to december of  at a cost of approximately million 
this transaction  net of the related gain on the hedges assigned to newfield  was the primary reason for the million net charge to earnings during relating to our derivative contracts that were not part of the monthly cash settlements on our derivatives contracts 
at december   our derivative contracts were recorded at their fair value  which was a net liability of approximately million  a decrease of approximately million from the million fair value liability recorded as of december  this change is the result of the expiration of most of our derivative contracts during due to the passage of time 
effective january   we have elected to de designate our existing derivative contracts as hedges and to account for them as speculative contracts going forward 
this means that any changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts will be charged to earnings on a quarterly basis instead of charging the effective portion to other comprehensive income and the balance to earnings 
information regarding our current hedging positions and historical hedging results is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
based on nymex crude oil futures prices at december   prices were considerably higher than the floor price of  so we would not expect to receive any funds even if oil prices were to drop 
since the oil hedges are puts or price floors  we do not have to make any payments on the hedges regardless of how high oil prices would go 
based on nymex natural gas futures prices at december   we would expect to make future cash payments of million on our natural gas commodity hedges 
if natural gas futures prices were to decline by  the amount we would expect to pay under our natural gas commodity hedges would decrease to million  and if futures prices were to increase by we would expect to pay million 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires that we select certain accounting policies and make certain estimates and judgments regarding the application of those policies 
our significant accounting policies are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the underlying assumptions and judgments by our management in their application  have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
following is a discussion of our most critical accounting estimates  judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements 
full cost method of accounting  depletion and depreciation and oil and natural gas reserves businesses involved in the production of oil and natural gas are required to follow accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry 
we apply the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties 
another acceptable method of accounting for oil and gas production activities is the successful efforts method of accounting 
in general  the primary differences between the two methods are related to the capitalization of costs and the evaluation for asset impairment 
under the full cost method  all geological and geophysical costs  exploratory dry holes and delay rentals are capitalized to the full cost pool  whereas under the successful efforts method such costs are expensed as incurred 
in the assessment of impairment of oil and gas properties  the successful efforts method follows the guidance of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  under which assets are measured for impairment against the undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent with management expectations 
under the full cost method  the full cost pool net book value of oil and gas properties is measured against future cash flows discounted at ten percent using commodity prices in effect at the end of the reporting period 
the financial results for a denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations given period could be substantially different depending on the method of accounting an oil and gas entity applies 
in our application of full cost accounting for our oil and gas producing activities  we make significant estimates at the end of each period related to accruals for oil and gas revenues  production  capitalized costs and operating expenses 
we calculate these estimates with our best available data  which includes among other things  production reports  price posting  information compiled from daily drilling reports and other internal tracking devices and analysis of historical results and trends 
while management is not aware of any required revisions to its estimates  there will likely be future adjustments resulting from such things as changes in ownership interests  payouts  joint venture audits  re allocations by the purchaser pipeline  or other corrections and adjustments common in the oil and natural gas industry  many of which will require retroactive application 
these types of adjustments cannot be currently estimated or determined and will be recorded in the period during which the adjustment occurs 
under full cost accounting  the estimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves used to compute depletion and the related present value of estimated future net cash flows therefrom used to perform the full cost ceiling test have a significant impact on the underlying financial statements 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is very complex  requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors  including additional development activity  evolving production history and continued reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that the reported reserve estimates represent the most accurate assessments possible  including the hiring of independent engineers to prepare the report  the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in our financial statement disclosures 
over the last four years  denbury s annual revisions to its reserve estimates have averaged approximately of the previous year s estimates and have been both positive and negative 
changes in commodity prices also affect our reserve quantities 
for instance  between and  commodity prices rebounded from the prior year s fall  resulting in an increase to our reserve quantities of approximately mmboe 
during and  the change related to commodity prices was virtually zero  less than in prior years  as prices were relatively high at year end  and these changes in quantities affect our dd a rate and the combined effect of changes in quantities and commodity prices impacts our full cost ceiling test calculation 
for example  we estimate that a increase in our estimate of proved reserves quantities would have lowered our fourth quarter dd a rate from per bbl to approximately per bbl and a decrease in our proved reserve quantities would have increased our dd a rate to approximately per bbl 
also  reserve quantities and their ultimate values are the primary factors in determining the borrowing base under our bank credit facility and are determined solely by our banks 
there can also be significant questions as to whether reserves are sufficiently supported by technical evidence to be considered proven 
in some cases our proven reserves are less than what we believe to exist because additional evidence  including production testing  is required in order to classify the reserves as proven 
in other cases  properties such as certain of our potential tertiary recovery projects may not have proven reserves assigned to them primarily because we have not yet completed a specific plan for development or firmly scheduled such development 
we have a corporate policy whereby we generally do not book proved undeveloped reserves unless the project has been committed to internally  which normally means it is scheduled within the next one to three years or at least the commencement of the project is scheduled in the case of longer term multi year projects such as waterfloods and tertiary recovery projects 
therefore  particularly with regard to potential reserves from tertiary recovery our co operations  there is uncertainty as to whether the reserves should be included as proven or not 
we also have a corporate policy whereby proved undeveloped reserves must be economic at long term historical prices  which during the last two years are significantly less than the year end prices used in our reserve report 
this also can have the effect of eliminating certain projects being included in our estimates of proved reserves  which projects would otherwise be included if undeveloped reserves were determined to be economic solely based on current prices in a high price environment  as was the case at year end and year end see depletion  depreciation and amortization under results of operations above for a further discussion 
all of these factors and the decisions made regarding these issues can have a significant effect on our proven reserves and thus on our dd a rate  full cost ceiling test calculation  borrowing base and financial statements 
denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset retirement obligations we have significant obligations related to the plugging and abandonment of our oil and gas wells  and the removal of equipment and facilities from leased acreage and returning such land to its original condition 
sfas no 
requires that we estimate the future cost of this obligation  discount it to its present value  and record a corresponding asset and liability in our consolidated balance sheets 
the values ultimately derived are based on many significant estimates  including the ultimate expected cost of the obligation  the expected future date of the required cash payment  and interest and inflation rates 
revisions to these estimates may be required based on changes to cost estimates  the timing of settlement  and changes in legal requirements 
any such changes that result in upward or downward revisions in the estimated obligation will result in an adjustment to the related capitalized asset and corresponding liability on a prospective basis and an adjustment in our dd a expense in future periods 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our asset retirement obligations 
income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes 
our federal and state income tax returns are generally not prepared or filed before the consolidated financial statements are prepared  therefore we estimate the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at the end of each period as well as the effects of tax rate changes  tax credits and prior to year end  net operating loss carryforwards 
adjustments related to these estimates are recorded in our tax provision in the period in which we file our income tax returns 
further  we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover or utilize our deferred tax assets primarily our enhanced oil recovery credits 
if recovery is not likely  we must record a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets for the amount we would not expect to recover  which would result in an increase to our income tax expense 
as of december   we believe that all of our deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet will ultimately be recovered 
if our estimates and judgments change regarding our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period it is determined that recovery is not probable 
a change in our effective tax rate would have increased our calculated income tax expense by approximately   and  for the years ended december   and see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information concerning our income taxes 
hedging activities we enter into derivative contracts ie  hedges to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk associated with future oil and natural gas production 
these contracts have historically consisted of options  in the form of price floors or collars  and fixed price swaps 
with the adoption of sfas no 
in  every derivative instrument was required to be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value 
if the derivative does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge  the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized currently in earnings 
if the derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting  the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive income equity to the extent that the hedge is effective and in the income statement to the extent it is ineffective 
we recognized ineffectiveness on our hedges of  for   for and million for with the significant changes in commodity prices over the last two years  the fair value of our hedges has fluctuated significantly 
while most of this change in value is recorded in other comprehensive income as most of our historical hedges have qualified for hedge accounting  the dramatic swing in commodity prices and the corresponding effect on the fair value of our hedges can cause a dramatic change to our balance sheet 
in order to qualify for hedge accounting the relationship between the hedging instruments and the hedged items must be highly effective in achieving the offset of changes in fair values or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk  both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis 
we measure and compute hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis 
if a hedging instrument becomes ineffective  hedge accounting is discontinued and any deferred gains or losses on the cash flow hedge remain in accumulated other comprehensive income until the periods during which the hedges would have otherwise expired 
if we determine it probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur  deferred gains or losses on the hedging instrument are recognized in earnings immediately 
most our current derivative hedging instruments qualify for hedge accounting although we plan to abandon hedge accounting as of january  this means that any changes in the future fair value of these derivative contracts will be charged to earnings on a quarterly basis instead of charging denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the effective portion to other comprehensive income and the balance to earnings 
for our three most recently completed fiscal years  if we had not chosen to designate hedge accounting treatment to our oil and natural gas hedge contracts  or if none of our derivative contracts had qualified for hedge accounting treatment  we estimate that our net income would have increased or decreased for  and by the following amounts million  million and million 
the preparation of financial statements requires us to make other estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during each reporting period 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and reliable and believe that the ultimate actual results will not differ significantly from those reported  however  such estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and such risks and uncertainties could cause the actual results to differ materially from our estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  which is a revision of sfas no 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r will require all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their estimated fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r must be adopted no later that july  and permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods o a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the adoption date 
o a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate either all prior periods presented or prior interim periods of the year of adoption based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb and related interpretations 
as such  we generally do not recognize compensation expense associated with employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method could have a significant impact on denbury s future results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
had the company adopted sfas no r in prior periods  the impact would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the pro forma net income and earnings per share disclosures above 
the adoption of sfas no 
r will have no effect on the company s unvested outstanding restricted stock awards 
we currently plan to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r on july  using the modified prospective method 
although we have not completed evaluating the impact the adoption of sfas no 
r will have on our future results of operations  we currently estimate the impact on an annual basis will be similar to our pro forma disclosures for sfas no 
in note to the consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r also requires the tax benefits in excess of recognized compensation expenses to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement may serve to reduce the denbury s future cash provided by operating activities and increase future cash provided by financing activities  to the extent of associated tax benefits that may be realized in the future
