and sony connect  tiscali spa and yahoo inc the use of the internet and wireless networks as a medium for media distribution has continued to evolve and grow in recent years 
traditional media and entertainment companies  such as major recorded music companies  or music labels  have in recent years faced significant challenges associated with the digital distribution of music 
these companies have now licensed the rights to some of their digital music content for distribution and sale online and on wireless networks on a subscription or individual track or album basis 
additionally  retailers and advertisers have expanded their use of digital content in the marketing and selling of their products and services 
as such  traditional distribution channels for media have expanded as content owners have begun to license and distribute their content online and over wireless networks through new and existing retail channels  and consumers have begun to purchase and consume content using personal computers  mobile devices and other digital devices 
in addition  traditional media formats have expanded to include a variety of digital technologies  rich media formats and digital rights management solutions 
we developed our solutions to address the new methods of media distribution  promotion and content management that have emerged over recent years 
our digital media services enable digital distribution of media via the internet  wireless networks and other emerging technologies 
these services encompass a variety of related services and provide the primary components needed to address the management and delivery of digital media on behalf of our customers 
the following is a description of our digital media services segment and our media restoration services segment 
digital media services segment 
we currently have three primary service offerings in our digital media services segment digital media store services  core services and content protection services 
our business model provides for a blend of higher margin revenue  generated by each of our service lines  and lower margin  yet scalable  revenue generated by the digital download and e commerce services of our digital media store services 
a more detailed description of each of our major service offerings follows 
digital media store services 
digital media store services include our end to end digital music store solution provided on a white labeled basis to retailers and brands throughout the world 
as a business to business provider  our services enable brands of varying types  including retailers and e tailers  portals  isps  and mobile operators  to outsource all or part of their digital media retailing activities 
by leveraging our proprietary technology and infrastructure  we provide our customers with a highly scalable consumer facing digital media commerce and delivery solution 
our services include hosting  publishing and managing digital media content  and delivering such content to end consumers on behalf of our customers 
our services support private label user interfaces and customized templates  and can readily function across both internet and mobile delivery protocols

our rights portfolio currently available for inclusion in our music store 
table of contents solution encompasses licenses in over countries and more than million individual tracks available for sale by our customers to end consumers 
core services 
core services include a suite of digital media services provided to both content owners and retailers 
we generate the majority of our revenue in this area from fees for encoding and fulfillment services we perform for emi music and various independent label catalogs  and from our leading samples service 
within core services  we provide a variety of back end services to most of the digital music services that have launched in the last few years 
examples of these services include digital media supply chain services 
our proprietary systems and technology enable the scalable archiving and retrieval of large libraries of digital media assets  or digital content 
digitized masters of the media assets are stored on our high capacity storage array systems and accessed via our proprietary  automated  web based access tools to search  deliver and manage such content 
such storage and access capabilities enable digital content to be processed and converted into different digital formats pursuant to our customers specifications via our proprietary encoding and transcoding systems 
to transmit digital content over the internet or other advanced digital distribution networks  the uncompressed  digitized content must be converted into compressed  network compatible digital formats 
our encoding services enable the conversion of such content into a particular form  along with the relevant metadata  such that the content can be readily and rapidly distributed over various distribution networks 
encoding large catalogs of content in an efficient manner is a complex process that requires highly scalable technology and supporting infrastructures 
digital encoding formats and technologies continue to evolve and often conflict with one another 
as a result  content owners often convert their digital assets into multiple formats and codecs which are algorithms that reduce the number of bytes consumed by large files and programs to support their distribution strategies 
additionally  the encoding process for a particular item or for an entire library is often repeated as a result of the introduction of new formats or distribution platforms 
our innovative digital media supply chain services address these challenges by providing an outsourced solution for the archiving  management  processing and distribution of our customers digital assets 
our digital media supply chain services also provide watermarking  encryption  metadata and other digital rights management services to enable our customers to protect and manage their content digitally 
we also provide project analysis  as well as consulting and other related services to support the digital fulfillment of encoded content libraries for content owners and retailers worldwide 
digital media content services 
we provide a hosted end to end streaming service that delivers high quality music samples to customers in the online and mobile entertainment sectors 
our music samples service consists of streaming digital content  or more specifically selections of such content  commonly referred to as samples  clips or previews 
digital media samples are used by customers for many purposes  including increasing online content sales  user traffic and customer retention 
we also provide an interactive radio service  or iradio tm 
the loudeye iradio tm service offers channels of cd quality streaming music delivered through a partner s own privately branded player interface 
it is capable of supporting delivery to a range of consumer music devices and appliances 
the iradio service can be deployed online for web based retailers and portals  as well as offline for consumer electronic devices and appliances  digital home entertainment systems and other digital broadcasting outlets 
content protection services 
content protection services include our anti piracy services provided to content owners to protect against the unauthorized distribution of content on peer to peer networks 
our content protection services provide a comprehensive solution to combat the proliferation of illegal content sharing and downloads typically found on peer to peer networks on a global basis 
the services  which are available globally  include titanium  a service featuring the industry s leading anti piracy service level agreement sla guaranteeing up to effectiveness in preventing the illegal sharing of digital content over peer to peer networks 
our services also include providing content owners powerful data mining and analytical tools and comprehensive information 
table of contents on digital media usage and sharing on peer to peer networks 
we also offer the potential of targeted promotional services redirecting potential consumers to legitimate services as a means for companies to capitalize on previously untapped revenue streams across content sharing networks 
we currently protect approximately  digital content titles and block hundreds of millions of download sessions each month  across all major peer to peer protocols 
media restoration services segment 
in january  we transferred substantially all of the assets of our media restoration services subsidiary  vidipax  inc  or vidipax  to a company controlled by vidipax s general manager 
in may  we completed the sale of this media restoration services business 
while we will have ongoing rights to co market and resell media restoration services for two years after the sale  media restoration services did not represent a significant portion of our revenue in  and we anticipate media restoration services will represent an insignificant portion of our revenue in the future 
industry background the digital media industry encompasses many sectors  software and technologies 
companies operating in the digital media industry focus on developing and deploying innovative technologies to perform  promote and distribute audio and video content over the internet and over other digitally enabled channels such as personal computers  televisions  mobile phones and other portable devices 
during  digital media continued to grow as a broad based tool for communications  online media promotions and the distribution of content  particularly in the media  entertainment and corporate sectors 
this growth has been driven in large part by an increase in broadband adoption  growth in the market for portable digital media devices and significant improvements in streaming technologies capable of delivering high quality content in smaller file sizes 
a critical trend in these technology and streaming format enhancements is a marked increase in ease of use and effectiveness of streaming media  including  in some cases  instant access to streaming content without buffering 
at the same time  content owners such as major media companies  film studios and record labels are providing more content in a digital format to capitalize on these opportunities 
the digital media industry has undergone significant changes since early  and is rapidly adapting to satisfy the growing consumer and business demand for digital media services 
jupiter research predicts that the market for full track downloads in the us will increase to nearly billion in key trends in the industry over the past year have included wide proliferation of digital music technologies and devices 
digital media is no longer confined to personal computers 
for example  since early there has been a significant and continuous increase in the number of portable digital music players  as well as an increase in the usage of digital music on other mobile devices 
we expect that a large portion of this growth will come from multipurpose digital media players such as mobile phones  dvd players  gaming devices and digital video recorders  or dvrs 
yankee group estimates that the worldwide ringtone market is approximately billion  with the us accounting for million of this amount 
new technologies also enable new ways to purchase and consume music 
music subscription services are expected to account for approximately million  or  of us music sales by  according to forrester research 
major record labels began licensing content 
music companies have faced stagnation in growth of new cd sales over the past three years  which they blame in part on illegal file swapping and other illegitimate means of copying and transferring copyrighted music 
to create a legal means to meet the strong consumer demand for digital music  and to compensate for lost revenue as a result of peer to peer file sharing  the music industry has generally supported the launch of new music stores and services by licensing their catalogs for digital distribution 

table of contents consumer migration from illegal file sharing to legitimate music downloads 
there are indications that illegal file sharing is declining due to factors including increased pressure from the recording industry association of america riaa in the us and counterpart organizations abroad  such as the music industry piracy investigations mipi in australia  including litigation directed at individual file traders and providers of peer to peer software 
corrupted files and other viruses embedded in files found on peer to peer networks 
the introduction and proliferation of legitimate digital music stores 
in  consumers could choose from more than different legal music web sites to download music  which is up from only in  according to the international federation of the phonographic industry  or ifpi 
due in large part to the above factors  illegal music files on the internet as a whole including peer to peer networks declined by million files over the course of  from million in january to million in january  according to the ifpi 
increasing consumer broadband connectivity 
the estimated number of us consumers with a broadband internet connection has reached approximately of the american online population  or approximately million users  according to nielsen net ratings 
jupiter research concludes that a larger internet audience using broadband connections will combine to generate approximately billion in annual digital music spending by these shifts in the industry present market opportunities for loudeye  as our turnkey service offerings address the technical challenges our partners face in launching their own music stores or digital media service offerings to distribute digital media content to end users 
challenges in digital media distribution to manage and distribute digital media  companies may develop internally the core competencies required to manage and distribute digital media content  or they may outsource these responsibilities to a third party 
these core competencies include application and business model support to enhance the audio and video experience  track and report usage  monetize and protect content  and manage customer service  scalable and reliable hosting and network distribution  high quality encoding and third party digital media technology support  digital media archive management  and source media and metadata capture 
it may be difficult or cost prohibitive for providers and distributors of digital media content to develop  manage  and maintain these core competencies on an ongoing basis  as such companies may lack the internal resources or time to develop the expertise necessary to address these problems without disrupting their core business activities 
metadata  which consists of textual information in digital form  provides descriptive data to the consumer such as  in the case of music  titles  artist information  track level data  title name  and cover art 
metadata may also include additional information that can be used to facilitate transactions or establish marketing relationships  such as links to online sale sites or opt ins for email marketing campaigns 
in addition  metadata is important to facilitating the administration of tracking and reporting required in many licensing arrangements with copyright holders 
in many circumstances  content owners have not compiled all of the metadata that distributors of digital media content need to effectively track  sell and distribute the content  such as upc information  genre classifications  and label and sublabel identifiers 
incomplete or inaccurate metadata can result in delays in delivering content to the marketplace 
in addition to the technical challenges  digital media distributors may encounter a number of difficulties in obtaining copyright licenses from content owners 
for example  a company may obtain a 
table of contents copyright license that enables it to distribute certain digital media content but only in one particular area such as reproduction and performance  wireless delivery or subscription based programming  to the exclusion of others 
consequently  the company may need to enter into additional licensing arrangements to use the same content in other areas 
as such rights are often held by different parties  such as publishers  artists and record labels  the effort to obtain such rights is often onerous  and may disrupt  delay or prevent the launch of a wide range of digital music business models 
for content owners  the digital media industry presents additional challenges 
for example  content owners must ensure proper and timely distribution of their music catalog to hundreds of music services around the world  ensure content is protected against unauthorized distribution or prohibited use  collect and manage usage reports and associated royalty payments for the sale of content  and manage sufficient and reliable technology resources to distribute content to partners and stay abreast of current technological developments

we support the online 
table of contents marketing initiatives of our customers through our digital media services including our leading music samples services  online radio services  and music download services 
scalable systems and network infrastructure provide significant capacity and reliability 
corporations and content owners may encounter capacity and technological limitations if they attempt to deliver digital media to large numbers of end users using in house production capabilities and network servers 
our solution is highly scalable  allowing us to process a large number of simultaneous audio or video events and to seamlessly add additional capacity as necessary 
we have developed proprietary services based upon an automated and distributed architecture of encoding  conversion and media enhancement systems 
we have one of the most extensive signal ingress capacities in the industry that allows us to acquire hundreds of audio and video signals simultaneously 
additionally  we can handle a wide range of other traditional and legacy media formats

table of contents seasonality sales from our music store services are seasonal in nature 
for the year ended december   we derived approximately of our total annual revenues from our music store services in the fourth quarter as compared to in third quarter in the recorded music business  purchases are heavily weighted towards the last three months of the calendar year 
this sales seasonality affects our operating results from quarter to quarter 
prior to our acquisition of od in june and the expansion of our music store services  we did not experience significant seasonality in our business 
we cannot assure you that our music store services sales will continue at the level experienced in the fourth quarter or that they will be higher than such sales for our other quarters 
seasonality in our business makes it more difficult to prepare period to period comparisons for our business 
operations and technology we manage our digital media services including encoding  content preparation  digital rights management  license verification  reporting and royalty payments  hosting and distribution to the internet  and digital music licensing from our us headquarters in seattle  washington  and our european headquarters in bristol  united kingdom 
we manage our overpeer anti piracy protection services from our offices in new york 
following is a summary of our primary operational activities and the associated technology 
digital media storage and access 
our proprietary systems and technologies enable the scalable archiving  retrieval and processing of large catalogs of digital media 
digitized content is stored on our high capacity storage array systems and accessed through our proprietary  automated web based access tools to search  provision and manage such content 
once captured and digitized in uncompressed format  content can be stored on our digital music archive system for later uses 
content processing services 
we process content to customer specifications using our proprietary production systems 
the production system is an automated  scalable combination of hardware and software consisting of advanced digital archive technology  proprietary file management systems  customized user interfaces and a highly distributed encoding system 
metadata is also used to track and report information required by many licensing arrangements with copyright holders 
encoding capabilities 
we encode customer content in a parallel process and we have developed proprietary processes which allow us to encode audio and video content across several streaming media and download formats simultaneously 
our parallel process supports multiple compression and decompression algorithms  or codecs  and technologies from third party developers such as microsoft corporation  realnetworks  inc  audible magic corporation and others 
this format flexibility enables customers to support a variety of digital media strategies 
because these formats and platforms continue to evolve  we believe that the benefits of our multiple platform approach will remain applicable as new technologies emerge 
encoded content is reviewed for quality and then delivered to the customer as a collection of files or routed automatically to our hosting services for direct delivery as a hosted stream or available download  over the internet and through loudeye s digital musicstore tm 
digital media distribution 
digitally formatted content can be delivered to customers through a range of methods  from secured file delivery to a fully hosted streaming or download service published and streamed through our network infrastructure and loudeye s digital musicstore 
content protection services 
our content protection and distribution services provide an effective means of protecting and distributing authorized digital content on various peer to peer networks 
in addition to offering service level guarantees for our anti piracy measures  copyright holders can gain market intelligence on the unauthorized digital distribution of their content as well as promotional and distribution tools to capitalize on previously untapped revenue opportunities across distributed peer to peer networks 

table of contents we have invested in a network distribution infrastructure built around scalable  redundant  cell based network architecture 
depending on the media format and the bit rate  we are able to stream and host simultaneously thousands of outbound streams or downloads 
we can expand our capacity by adding additional servers within cells 
this network is backed by high capacity online storage that uses mirroring and other techniques to increase redundancy and scalability 
our hosting and distribution operation includes hundreds of servers and supports load balancing and other network management techniques that have been optimized for digital media distribution  including music downloads 
we can also serve content across networks of other providers if we exceed our capacity or if we are requested to do so by our customers 
our operations and production personnel are organized into functional teams which include project management  quality control  logistics operations  data measurement  audio capture and encoding  video capture and encoding  and systems engineering support 
in addition  we have a team that supports our network and hosting services 
as of march   we had full time employees in engineering  network services and information technology support and full time employees in our production and research and development areas 
foreign and domestic operations and geographic data prior to  all of our sales were derived from selling activities conducted within the united states 
in june  we acquired od  one of the largest digital music service providers in europe 
as a result of this acquisition  approximately of our revenue in came from customers in the us  while us customers  primarily in europe  accounted for of our revenue in information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in part ii  item of this annual report in the notes to the consolidated financial statements at note  business segment information 
customers the target customers for our digital media services include major consumer electronics companies  traditional and internet based retailers  media and entertainment companies  wireless carriers and branded consumer products companies 
in  we served over customers 
some of our customers include amazon 
com  inc  america online  inc  apple computer  inc  belgacom group  cingular wireless formerly at t wireless services inc  the coca cola company  emi recorded music holdings  france telecom  microsoft corporation and msn  nokia corporation  siebel systems  inc  sony music entertainment inc and sony connect  tiscali spa and yahoo inc 
in  no customer accounted for or more of our revenue 
in  the coca cola company accounted for of our revenue 
in  the coca cola company accounted for of our revenue and microsoft corporation accounted for of our revenue 
a significant portion of our revenue from the coca cola company related to media restoration services which we ceased providing with our sale of that business in early competition the market for digital media solutions is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive 
we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future 
although we do not currently compete against any one entity with respect to all aspects of our services  we do compete with various companies and technologies in regards to specific elements of our services 
in addition  we face competition from in house solutions 
for our digital music solutions  we compete in the us and foreign markets with several companies providing similar levels of outsourced digital music services including groove mobile formerly chaoticom  liquid digital  melodeo  inc  musicnet  inc  musicnow llc  musiwave  mpo group  siemens ag  soundbuzz pte ltd and digital world services ag  as well as in house efforts by our potential customers 
our customers face significant competition from free peer to peer services  such as metamachine inc s edonkey  sharman network inc s kazaa  streamcast networks  inc 
s morpheus  grokster  ltd 
and a variety of other similar services that allow computer users to connect with each other and to copy many types of program files  including music and other media  from one another s hard drives  
table of contents all without securing licenses from content providers 
for our music samples services  we compete with companies including muze inc and aec one stop group  inc s all music guide 
competitors for our content protection services include macrovision corporation  mediadefender and media sentry  inc in addition  well capitalized  diversified digital media technology companies such as microsoft corporation  apple computer inc and real networks  inc compete with our customers and may compete with us in the future with their own services 
for certain services  such as encoding and music distribution  the major record labels have acquired or otherwise invested in digital music services and technologies that could compete with our services 
traditional and satellite radio broadcasters have developed online music and radio services which also compete with our solutions 
a significant source of competition includes our potential customers who choose to independently invest in systems and infrastructure to digitally manage  encode and or host and deliver their own media directly  thereby not requiring a business to business provider for such services 
in house services are expected to remain a significant competitor to our services  although we believe that as digital media strategies expand  and the scale of infrastructure and applications required to support business strategies increases  companies that currently manage these processes internally will see a significant economic advantage to outsourcing 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include ability to offer a private branded solution customer service and support service functionality scalability of services service quality security of services service performance breadth of content available although we believe that our services compete favorably with respect to each of the competitive factors described above  the market for our services is new and evolving rapidly 
we may not compete successfully against current or future competitors  many of which have substantially more capital  longer operating histories  greater brand recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
these competitors may also engage in more extensive development of their technologies  adopt more aggressive pricing policies or establish more comprehensive marketing and advertising campaigns than we can 
our competitors may develop service offerings that are more sophisticated than our own 
for these and other reasons  our competitors services may achieve greater acceptance in the marketplace than our own  limiting our ability to gain market share and customer loyalty and to generate sufficient revenue to achieve a profitable level of operations 
for additional discussion of the risks associated with competition in our industry  see risk factors competition may decrease our market share  revenues and gross margins  and we face competition from free peer to peer services such as edonkey  kazaa and morpheus  from emerging paid online music services delivered electronically  and from traditional retail music distributors 
operational segments during  we operated in two different business segments digital media services and media restoration services 
in  we sold our media restoration services business and we anticipate that media restoration services will represent an insignificant portion of our revenues in the future 
as discussed above under overview  and elsewhere in this annual report  digital media services can be further sub divided into three categories of services core services  content protection services and digital music store services 
further information regarding our operating segments may be found in part ii  item of this annual report in the notes to consolidated financial statements at note  business segment information 
research and development we believe that significant research and development effort are essential for us to maintain our market position  to continue to expand our digital media services  in particular for our digital media store services  and to develop additional service offerings 
accordingly  we anticipate that we will continue to 
table of contents invest in research and development for the foreseeable future  and we anticipate that research and development costs as an absolute dollar amount will fluctuate  depending primarily upon the level of future revenue  customer needs  staffing levels  overhead costs and our assessment of market demands 
our research and development expenditures totaled approximately million in  million in  and million in proprietary rights and intellectual property we rely primarily on a combination of copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws and contractual obligations with employees and third parties to protect our proprietary rights 
we have four issued patents in the us  and we have filed seven us patent applications and twelve international patent applications that claim priority to six previously filed provisional applications 
overpeer holds multiple patents in asia and europe  and has four patents pending in the us for their proprietary technology  systems and software 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our services and obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in addition  other parties may breach confidentiality agreements or other protective contracts we have entered into and we may not be able to enforce our rights in the event of these breaches 
furthermore  we expect that we will increase our international operations in the future and the laws of many foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
the digital music industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents  licenses and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement and the violation of other intellectual property rights 
as discussed above  obtaining the requisite licenses can be difficult  as separate licenses often must be obtained from a variety of rights holders for distinct activities related to the delivery of digital music  such as distribution and performance  which requires separate licensing arrangements 
in addition  these copyrights may be held by different parties  such as publishers  artists and record labels 
the music industry in the united states is generally regarded as highly litigious 
as a result  in the future we may be engaged in litigation with others in the music industry  including those entities with which we have ongoing content license arrangements 
although we attempt to avoid infringing known proprietary rights of third parties in our development efforts  we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims for alleged infringement of third party proprietary rights  such as patents  trademarks or copyrights  by us or our licensees  from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
any claims relating to the infringement of third party proprietary rights  even if not meritorious  could result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements which are not advantageous to us 
in addition  parties making these claims may be able to obtain an injunction  which could prevent us from providing our services in the united states or abroad 
any of these results could harm our business 
we may increasingly be subject to infringement claims if the number of services and competitors in our industry grow and the scope of services overlap 
government regulation we are not currently subject to direct regulation by any governmental agency  other than laws and regulations generally applicable to businesses  although certain us export controls and import controls of other countries  including controls on the use of encryption technologies  may apply to our services 
few existing laws or regulations specifically apply to the internet 
however  it is likely that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted in the united states and other countries with respect to the internet 
these laws may relate to areas such as content issues such as obscenity  indecency and defamation  encryption concerns  including export contents  copyright and other intellectual property rights  caching of content by server products  electronic authentication or digital signatures  personal privacy  advertising  taxation  electronic commerce liability  email  network and information security and the convergence of traditional communication services with internet communications  including the future availability of broadband transmission capability 
other countries and political organizations may also impose regulations  some of which may conflict with us regulations 

table of contents the adoption of such laws or regulations  and the uncertainties associated with their validity and enforcement  may affect our ability to provide our services  may increase the costs associated with our services and may affect the growth of the internet generally 
these laws or regulations may therefore harm our business 
we do not know with certainty how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  copyright and other intellectual property issues  taxation  illegal or obscene content  retransmission of media and personal privacy and data protection apply to the internet or to the distribution of music over the internet 
the vast majority of such laws were adopted before the advent of the internet and related technologies and do not address the unique issues associated with the internet and related technologies 
most of the laws that relate to the internet have not yet been interpreted 
changes to or the interpretation of these laws could limit the growth of the internet  create uncertainty in the marketplace that could reduce demand for our services  increase our cost of doing business  expose us to significant liabilities associated with content distributed or accessed through our services  or lead to increased service and applications development costs  or otherwise harm our business 
specifically  with respect to one aspect of copyright law  on october   the digital millennium copyright act  or dmca  was enacted 
the dmca includes statutory licenses for the performance of sound recordings and for the making of recordings to facilitate transmissions 
under these statutory licenses  depending on our future business activities  we and our customers may be required to pay licensing fees for digital sound recordings we deliver or our customers provide on their web site and through retransmissions of radio broadcasts and or other audio content 
the dmca does not specify the rate and terms of such licenses  which will be determined either through voluntary inter industry negotiations or arbitration 
moreover  with respect to digital publishing  sound recording and other music licenses not directly covered by the dmca  various parties interested in distribution of digital music have engaged in proceedings before a tribunal of the united states copyright office along with the riaa to determine what  if any  licensee fees should be paid to various rights holders 
depending on the rates and terms adopted for the statutory licenses  our business could be harmed both by increasing our own cost of doing business  and by increasing the cost of doing business for our customers 
employees as march   we had a total of full time employees  of which were in operations  were in research and development  were in sales and marketing  were in engineering  network services and information technology support  and were in general and administration 
of these  employees were located in our seattle  washington offices  were located across our european operations of which were located in bristol  uk  one was located in sydney  australia  one was located in los angeles  california and were located in new york  new york 
none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
risk factors loudeye operates in a dynamic and rapidly changing industry that involves numerous risks and uncertainties  both in the us and abroad 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may impair our business operations in the future 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  operating results and financial position could be harmed 

table of contents risks related to our business we have a history of losses on a quarterly and annual basis and we may experience greater losses from operations than we currently anticipate 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have incurred net losses from inception  and we expect to continue to incur net losses in future periods 
to achieve future profitability  we will need to generate additional revenue or reduce expenditures 
we can give no assurance that we will achieve sufficient revenue or reduced expenditures to be profitable on either a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
even if we ultimately do achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on either a quarterly or annual basis 
our quarterly and annual financial results will continue to fluctuate making it difficult to forecast our operating results 
our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and we expect our revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including market acceptance of our services  variability in demand for our digital media services  competition from other companies entering our markets  ability of our customers and ourselves to procure necessary intellectual property rights for digital media content  willingness of our customers to enter into longer term volume or recurring revenue digital media services agreements and purchase orders in light of the economic and legal uncertainties related to their business models  charges related to restructuring of our business  including personnel reductions and excess facilities  and governmental regulations affecting use of the internet  including regulations concerning intellectual property rights and security measures 
our limited operating history  unproven business model and significant acquisitions and dispositions of businesses in particular our acquisition of od in june  further contribute to the difficulty of making meaningful quarterly comparisons and forecasts 
our current and future levels of operating expenses and capital expenditures are based largely on our growth plans and estimates of expected future revenue 
these expenditure levels are  to a large extent  fixed in the short term and our sales cycle can be lengthy 
thus  we may not be able to adjust spending or generate new revenue sources in a timely manner to compensate for any shortfall in revenue  and any significant shortfall in revenue relative to planned expenditures could have an immediate adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
if our operating results fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in some future periods  our stock price could decline significantly 
we have not completed the integration of all our acquisitions  and we may need to make additional future acquisitions to remain competitive 
the process of identifying  acquiring and integrating these future acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we have completed a number of acquisitions during the past three fiscal years  and we expect to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions in the future 
in march  we completed the acquisition of overpeer and in june we completed the acquisition of od integrating the overpeer and od acquisitions and completing any potential future acquisitions could cause significant diversions of management time and company resources 
in the past  we have divested acquired assets  partially as a result of failure of an acquired company s business to integrate fully with ours  as with the media 
table of contents restoration business of our former vidipax subsidiary that we acquired in june and divested in early our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to integrate the operations of current or future acquired companies or joint ventures 
our ability to integrate operations of acquired companies will depend  in part  on our ability to overcome or address the difficulties of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies and realizing anticipated operational and cost efficiencies without disruption to the ongoing business  impairment of relationships with employees  affiliates  advertisers and content providers of our business and acquired businesses  the loss of key management and the difficulties in retaining key management or employees of acquired companies  operational difficulties  including the need to attract and retain qualified personnel and the need to attract customers and advertisers  the cost and challenges of integrating it and financial systems  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns and the potential disruption of our ongoing business  the need to incorporate successfully the acquired or shared technology or content and rights into our services  including maintaining customer satisfaction while migrating to a single development platform  and the difficulties of maintaining uniform standards  systems  controls  procedures and policies 
in addition  completing acquisitions could require use of a significant amount of our available cash 
furthermore  financing for future acquisitions may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
if we identify an appropriate acquisition candidate for any of our businesses  we may not be able to negotiate the terms of the acquisition successfully  finance the acquisition or integrate the acquired business  technologies or employees into our existing business and operations 
future acquisitions may not be well received by the investment community  which may cause our stock price to fall 
we cannot ensure that we will be able to identify or complete any acquisition in the future 
if we acquire businesses  new services  or technologies in the future  we may be required to amortize significant amounts of identifiable intangible assets and we may record significant amounts of goodwill that will be subject to at least annual testing for impairment 
for example  in the first quarter we recorded impairments to goodwill of million   to intangible assets and  to property and equipment related to our enterprise communication services and media restoration services business 
a significant portion of those impairments related to assets acquired in our acquisition of tt holding corp 
in november if we consummate one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration consists of stock or other securities  our existing stockholders ownership would be diluted significantly 
if we were to proceed with one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration included cash  we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash 
the anticipated benefits of any acquisition may not be realized 
if any of the negative events occur  our results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected 
we have restructured our business and if we are unsuccessful in executing on our revised business strategy  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be seriously harmed 
we have shifted our business plan to offering full service business to business digital media solutions 
you should consider our prospects in executing on our revised business strategy in light of the risk  
table of contents expenses and difficulties we may encounter as an early stage company in the new and rapidly evolving market segments we serve 
as a result of such risks  expenses and difficulties  we may not be successful in establishing and maintaining broad market acceptance of our services and converting that acceptance into direct and indirect sources of revenue  establishing and maintaining our brand name  successfully developing new service offerings and features on a timely basis and increasing the functionality and features of existing services  successfully responding to our current competition including  competition from emerging technologies and solutions  developing and maintaining strategic relationships to enhance the distribution  features  content and utility of our services  and attracting  training and retaining qualified sales  technical and customer support personnel 
we might not be successful in implementing our business strategy in a cost effective manner  if at all  and the implementation may require significant additional expenditures on our part 
the capital requirements of our business strategy combined with the expectation that we will incur net losses in future periods could have a serious adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial position 
our capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned if  for example  we incur unforeseen capital expenditures  unforeseen operating expenses or make investments to maintain our competitive position 
if we lack necessary capital  we may have to delay or abandon some or all of our development plans or otherwise forego market opportunities 
our inability to execute on our strategy could result in increased expenses and decreased revenue  either or both of which could seriously harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our success is dependent on the performance and integration of our new ceo and cfo coo and the cooperation  performance and retention of our executive officers and key employees 
michael brochu joined as our chief executive officer on january  ronald stevens joined as our chief financial officer and chief operating officer on march  our business and operations are substantially dependent on the performance and integration of our new ceo and coo cfo  as well as the performance of our other executives 
our senior executives have worked together for only a short period of time 
we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our executive officers 
the loss of one or several key employees could seriously harm our business 
any reorganization or reduction in the size of our employee base could harm our ability to attract and retain other valuable employees critical to the success of our business 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future to execute on our current business plan 
our existing cash reserves may not be sufficient to fund operating and other expenses under our current business plan until projected profitability 
as a result  to execute on our current business plan  we may need to secure additional financing 
in the event additional financing is required  we may not be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may need to sell assets or reduce expenditures  or both  and we may not be able to pursue our business objectives 
this inability could seriously harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are subject to exchange rate risk in connection with approximately million approximately million based on exchange rates as of march  that is payable in cash to former od shareholders in july  and in connection with our international operations 
we are obligated to pay approximately million approximately million based on exchange rates as of march  in cash in july to former od shareholders 
the payments are payable in 
table of contents british pounds  and accordingly  we are exposed to risks with changes in the prevailing exchange rate 
we may hedge this risk 
if we do not hedge against exchange rate risk  any decrease in the value of the us dollar against the british pound will cause a proportional increase in the amount of the future consideration we must pay to the former od shareholders 
in addition  the results of operations of od are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of this subsidiary are translated from the local currency to us dollars upon consolidation 
because of the significance of the operations of od to our consolidated operations  as exchange rates vary  net sales and other operating results  when translated  may differ materially from our prior performance and our expectations 
in addition  because of the significance of our overseas operations  we could also be significantly affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce demand for our services and further negatively impact results of operations in a material and adverse manner 
as a result of these market risks  the price of our stock could decline significantly and rapidly 
we may in the future engage in hedging activities 
as foreign currency exchange rates vary  the fluctuations in revenue and expenses may materially impact the financial statements upon consolidation 
a weaker us dollar would result in an increase to revenue and expenses upon consolidation  and a stronger us dollar would result in a decrease to revenue and expenses upon consolidation 
our music content licenses are generally for limited terms 
if we are unable to reach agreement with recorded music companies  especially with the four major recorded music companies  to renew existing licenses or to grant us expanded license rights  portions of our services could be interrupted and our business and results of operations could be harmed 
we have content license agreements with all four major recorded music companies emi music marketing  sony bmg music entertainment  umg recordings  and warner music group and numerous independent record labels  and in each case our license grants are for finite terms and require the consent of the label to renew 
in addition  these content licenses may be terminated by the recorded music companies at any time upon a specified period of advance notice or under circumstances such as our breach of these agreements 
if we are unsuccessful in securing renewals of these label license agreements before expiration of existing agreements  our digital media services with respect to any one or a number of the labels content could be interrupted  and our business and results of operations could be harmed 
in addition  if we are unsuccessful in obtaining additional license rights from the content owners for emerging distribution methods  such as subscription services  our business and results of operations could be harmed 
our music content licenses generally require prior approval for us to distribute content to our customers 
if approval is delayed or withheld  portions of our services could be interrupted and our business and results of operations could be harmed 
our content license agreements from the major recorded music companies generally require prior approval before we can distribute content to our customers 
if approval is delayed or withheld  we may not be able to satisfy our contractual obligations to our customers 
as a result  our reputation within the music industry could be harmed  our services could be interrupted and our business and results of operations could be harmed 
our music content licenses could result in operational complexity that may divert resources or make our business more expensive to conduct 
the large number of licenses in the us and in the foreign markets in which we operate that we need to maintain in order to operate our music related services creates operational difficulties in connection with tracking the rights that we have acquired and the complex structures under which we have royalty and reporting obligations 
in addition  in some circumstances  we are responsible for tracking and remitting royalties to professional rights organizations  both in the us and abroad  such as the american society of composers  authors and publishers  inc ascap  broadcast music  inc bmi  sesac  inc 
sesac or the mcps prs alliance limited in the united kingdom  which adds to the complexity of 
table of contents the royalty structure in which we operate 
our licensing agreements typically allow the third party to audit our royalty tracking and payment mechanisms to ensure that we are accurately reporting and paying royalties owed 
if we are unable to accurately track amounts that we must pay to the numerous parties with whom we have licenses in connection with each delivery of digital music services or if we do not deliver the appropriate payment in a timely fashion  we may risk financial penalties and or termination of licenses 
we rely on strategic relationships to promote our services and for access to licensed technology  if we fail to maintain or enhance existing relationships or obtain new relationships  our ability to serve our customers and develop new services could be harmed 
our ability to provide our services to users of multiple technologies and platforms depends significantly on our ability to develop and maintain our strategic relationships with key streaming media technology companies and content providers 
we rely on these relationships for licensed technology and content 
obtaining comprehensive music content licenses is challenging  as doing so may require us to obtain copyright licenses with various third parties in the fragmented recorded music and publishing industries 
these copyrights often address differing activities related to the delivery of digital media  including reproduction and performance  some of which may require separate licensing arrangements from various rights holders such as publishers  artists and record labels 
the effort to obtain the necessary rights by such third parties is often significant  and could disrupt  delay  or prevent us from executing our business plans 
because of the large number of potential parties from which we must obtain licenses  we may never be able to obtain a sufficient number of licenses to allow us to provide services that will meet our customers expectations 
due to the evolving nature of our industry  we will need to develop additional relationships to adapt to changing technologies and standards and to work with newly emerging companies with whom we do not have pre existing relationships 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in developing new relationships or that our partners will view these relationships as significant to their own business or that they will continue their commitment to us in the future 
if we are unable to maintain or enhance these relationships  we may have difficulty strengthening our technology development and increasing the adoption of our brand and services 
competition may decrease our market share  revenue  and gross margins 
we face intense and increasing competition in the global digital media services market 
if we do not compete effectively or if we experience reduced market share from increased competition  our business will be harmed 
in addition  the more successful we are in the emerging market for digital media services  the more competitors are likely to emerge 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include ability to offer a private branded solution  service functionality  quality and performance  ease of use  reliability  scalability and security of services  establishing a significant base of customers and distribution partners  ability to introduce new services to the market in a timely manner  customer service and support  attracting third party web developers  and pricing 
competition in our core business to business digital media services comes from in house efforts by our potential customers  and from companies such as groove mobile formerly chaoticom  liquid digital  melodeo  musicnet  inc  musicnow llc  musiwave  mpo group  siemens ag  soundbuzz 
table of contents and digital world services ag 
competitors for our anti piracy services business include macrovision  mediadefender and media sentry 
in addition  our customers for digital media distribution services face competition from other providers of digital distribution services to customers including apple computer inc s itunes  napster  realnetworks inc 
s rhapsody  musicnet  inc and sony connect inc 
many of our competitors have substantially more capital  longer operating histories  greater brand recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
these competitors may also engage in more extensive development of their technologies  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and establish more comprehensive marketing and advertising campaigns than we can 
our competitors may develop service offerings that we do not offer or that are more sophisticated or more cost effective than our own 
for these and other reasons  our competitors services may achieve greater acceptance in the marketplace than our own  limiting our ability to gain or maintain market share and customer loyalty and to generate sufficient revenue to achieve a profitable level of operations 
our failure to adequately address any of the above factors could harm our business and results of operations 
we face competition from free peer to peer services such as edonkey  kazaa and morpheus  from emerging paid online music services delivered electronically  and from traditional retail music distributors 
the online music services of our customers face significant competition from free peer to peer services  such as metamachine inc s edonkey  sharman network inc s kazaa  streamcast networks  inc 
s morpheus  grokster  ltd 
and a variety of other similar services that allow computer users to connect with each other and to copy many types of program files  including music and other media  from one another s hard drives  all without securing licenses from content providers 
the legal status of these free services is uncertain  because although some courts have found that these services violate copyright laws  other services such as grokster have been found to not violate any copyright laws 
additionally  enforcement efforts against those in violation have not effectively shut down these services  and there can be no assurance that these services will ever be shut down 
the ongoing presence of these free services substantially impairs the marketability of legitimate services  regardless of the ultimate resolution of their legal status 
because digital recorded music formats  such as mp  do not always contain mechanisms for tracking the source or ownership of digital recordings  users are able to download and distribute unauthorized or pirated copies of copyrighted recorded music over the internet 
this piracy is a significant concern to record companies and artists  and is a primary reason many record companies and artists are reluctant to digitally deliver their recorded music over the internet 
as long as pirated recordings are available  many consumers will choose free pirated recordings rather than paying for legitimate recordings 
accordingly  if this issue is not addressed  our business might be harmed 
we depend on a limited number of customers for a significant percentage of our revenue 
accordingly  the loss of  or delay in payment from  one or a small number of customers could have a significant impact on our revenue  operating results and cash flows 
a limited number of customers have accounted for a significant percentage of our revenue and may continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
during the year ended december   no customers accounted for or more of our revenue 
during and  the coca cola company accounted for approximately and of our revenue 
a significant portion of our revenue from the coca cola company related to media restoration services which we ceased providing with our sale of that business in early we believe that a small number of customers may continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
due to high revenue concentration among a limited number of customers  the cancellation  reduction or delay of a large customer order or our failure to complete or deliver a project on a timely basis during a given quarter is likely to significantly reduce revenue 
in addition  if any significant customer fails to pay amounts it owes us  or does not pay those amounts on time  our financial condition  revenue and operating results could suffer 
if we are unsuccessful in increasing and broadening our customer base  our business could be harmed 

table of contents if we do not continue to add customers for our services  our revenue and business will be harmed 
in order to achieve return on our investments in new service offerings  we must continue to add new customers while minimizing the rate of loss of existing customers 
if our other marketing and promotional activities fail to add new customers at a rate significantly higher than our rate of loss  our business will suffer 
in addition  if the costs of such marketing and promotional activities increase in order to add new customers  our margins and operating results will suffer 
our business will suffer if we do not anticipate and meet specific customer requirements or respond to technological change 
the market for digital media services is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new service offerings  new device introductions and changes in customer requirements  some of which are unique or on a customer by customer basis 
we may be unable to respond quickly or effectively to these developments or requirements 
our future success will depend to a substantial degree on our ability to offer services that incorporate leading technology  address the increasingly sophisticated  varied or individual needs of our current and prospective customers and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost effective basis 
you should be aware that our technology or systems may become obsolete upon the introduction of alternative technologies  we may not have sufficient resources to develop or acquire new technologies or the ability to introduce new services capable of competing with future technologies or service offerings  and the price of our services is likely to decline as rapidly as the cost of any competitive alternatives 
the development of new or enhanced services through technology development activities is a complex and uncertain process that requires the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
we may experience design  manufacturing  marketing and other difficulties that could delay or prevent the development  introduction or marketing of new services and enhancements 
in addition  our inability to effectively manage the transition from older services to newer services could cause disruptions to customer orders and harm our business and prospects 
average selling prices of our services may decrease  which may harm our gross margins 
the average selling prices of our services may be lower than expected as a result of competitive pricing pressures  promotional programs and customers who negotiate price reductions in exchange for longer term purchase commitments or otherwise 
the pricing of services sold to our customers depends on the duration of the agreement  the specific requirements of the order  the sales and service support and other contractual agreements 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience pricing pressure and anticipate that the average selling prices and gross margins for our services will decrease 
we may not be successful in developing and introducing on a timely basis new services with enhanced features or improved versions of our existing services that can be sold at higher gross margins 
our music store business has lower gross margins than other lines of our business 
in june  we acquired od and subsequently have placed greater focus on growing our music store services 
on a blended basis  costs of our music store services as a percentage of the revenue generated by those services are higher than those of our core services and content protection services 
the cost of third party music content  in particular  is a substantial percentage of revenue we receive from our music store customers and is unlikely to decrease significantly over time as a percentage of revenue 
a trend towards more music store services as a percentage of our total revenue will reduce our overall gross margins 

table of contents our music store services operating results fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis 
sales of recorded music tend to be seasonal in nature  with a disproportionate percentage of annual music purchases occurring in the fourth quarter 
we expect transactional related revenues from our digital media stores services to be impacted by such seasonality long term  however  increasing consumer adoption of digital media services should largely mitigate the impact of such seasonality in the near term 
this sales seasonality may affect our operating results from quarter to quarter 
prior to our acquisition of od in june and the expansion of our music store services  we did not experience significant seasonality in our business 
we cannot assure you that revenue from our music store services will continue at the level experienced in the fourth quarter or that they will be higher than such revenue for our other quarters 
seasonality in our business makes it more difficult to prepare period to period comparisons for our business 
we may be liable or alleged to be liable to third parties for music  software  and other content that we encode  distribute  archive or make available to our customers 
we may be liable or alleged to be liable to third parties  such as the recorded music companies and professional rights organizations  for the content that we encode  distribute  archive or make available to our customers if the performance of our services is not properly licensed by the content owners or their representatives such as the recorded music companies and professional rights organizations  if the content or the performance of our services violates third party copyright  trademark  or other intellectual property rights  if our customers violate the intellectual property rights of others by providing content to us or by having us perform digital media services  if the manner of delivery of content is alleged to violate terms of use of third party delivery systems  such as peer to peer networks  or if content that we encode or otherwise handle for our customers is deemed obscene  indecent  or defamatory 
any alleged liability could harm our business by damaging our reputation  requiring us to incur legal costs in defense  exposing us to awards of damages and costs and diverting management s attention which could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our customers for encoding services generally agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from claims arising from their failure to have the right to encode the content given to us for that purpose 
however  customers may contest this responsibility or not have sufficient resources to defend claims and we have limited or no insurance coverage for claims of this nature 
because we host  stream and webcast audio and video content on or from our website and on other websites for customers and provide services related to digital media content  we face potential liability or alleged liability for negligence  infringement of copyright  patent  or trademark rights  defamation  indecency and other claims based on the nature and content of the materials we host 
claims of this nature have been brought  and sometimes successfully prosecuted  against content distributors 
in addition  we could be exposed to liability with respect to the unauthorized encoding of content or unauthorized use of other parties proprietary technology  including third party delivery systems such as peer to peer networks 
any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage or any alleged liability could harm our business 
we cannot provide assurance that third parties will not claim infringement by us with respect to past  current  or future technologies 
the music industry in particular has recently been the focus of infringement claims 
we expect that participants in our markets will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of services and competitors in our industry segment grows 
in addition  these risks are difficult to quantify in light of the continuously evolving nature of laws and regulations 
table of contents governing the internet 
any claim relating to proprietary rights  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause service upgrade delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  and we can not assure you that we will have adequate insurance coverage or that royalty or licensing agreements will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to protect our intellectual property  and we may be found to infringe on proprietary rights of others  which could harm our business 
our intellectual property is important to our business  and we seek to protect our intellectual property through copyrights  trademarks  patents  trade secrets  confidentiality provisions in our customer  supplier and strategic relationship agreements  nondisclosure agreements with third parties  and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors 
we cannot assure you that measures we take to protect our intellectual property will be successful or that third parties will not develop alternative solutions that do not infringe upon our intellectual property 
we could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims by others 
for example  on september   we were served in a patent infringement lawsuit brought by altnet  inc  and others against loudeye  our overpeer subsidiary  marc morgenstern  one of our executive officers  the recording industry association of america and others 
the complaint  filed in federal district court in los angeles  california  involves two patents that appear to cover file identifiers for use in accessing  identifying and or sharing files over peer to peer networks 
the complaint alleges that the anti piracy solutions offered by our overpeer subsidiary infringe the patents in question 
the complaint does not state a specific damage amount 
in addition  potential customers may be deterred from distributing content over the internet for fear of infringement claims 
the music industry in particular has recently been the focus of heightened concern with respect to copyright infringement and other misappropriation claims  and the outcome of developing legal standards in that industry is expected to affect music  video and other content being distributed over the internet 
if  as a result  potential customers forego distributing traditional media content over the internet  demand for our digital media services could be reduced which would harm our business 
the music industry in the us is generally regarded as extremely litigious in nature compared to other industries and we could become engaged in litigation with others in the music industry 
claims against us  and any resultant litigation  should they occur in regard to any of our digital media services  could subject us to significant liability for damages including treble damages for willful infringement 
in addition  even if we prevail  litigation could be time consuming and expensive to defend and could result in the diversion of our time and attention 
any claims from third parties may also result in limitations on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims 
further  we offer our digital media services to customers in foreign countries that may offer less protection for our intellectual property than the united states 
our failure to protect against misappropriation of our intellectual property  or claims that we are infringing the intellectual property of third parties could have a negative effect on our business  revenue  financial condition and results of operations 
we must enhance our existing digital media services and develop and introduce new services to remain competitive in that segment 
any failure to do so in a timely manner will cause our results of operations to suffer 
the market for digital media services is characterized by rapidly changing technologies 
this market characteristic is heightened by the emerging nature of the internet and the continuing trend of companies from many industries to offer internet based applications and services 
the widespread adoption of the new internet  networking  streaming media  or telecommunications technologies or other technological changes 
table of contents could require us to incur substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our operating practices or infrastructure 
our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to identify and respond to emerging technological trends in the market  enhance our services by adding innovative features that differentiate our digital media services from those of our competitors  develop  acquire and license leading technologies  bring digital media services to market and scale our business and operations on a timely basis at competitive prices  and respond effectively to new technological changes or new service announcements by others 
we will not be competitive unless we continually introduce new services or enhancements to existing services that meet evolving industry standards and customer needs 
in the future  we may not be able to address effectively the compatibility and interoperability issues that arise as a result of technological changes and evolving industry standards 
the technical innovations required for us to remain competitive are inherently complex  require long development schedules and are dependent in some cases on sole source suppliers 
we will be required to continue to invest in research and development in order to attempt to maintain and enhance our existing technologies and services  but we may not have the funds available to do so 
even if we have sufficient funds  these investments may not serve the needs of customers or be compatible with changing technological requirements or standards 
most development expenses must be incurred before the technical feasibility or commercial viability of new or enhanced services and applications can be ascertained 
revenue from future services or enhancements to services may not be sufficient to recover the associated development costs 
the technology underlying our services is complex and may contain unknown defects that could harm our reputation  result in liability or decrease market acceptance of our services 
the technology underlying our digital media services is complex and includes software that is internally developed and software licensed from third parties  including open source software 
these software products may contain errors or defects  particularly when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released 
we may not discover software defects that affect our current or new services or enhancements until after they are sold 
furthermore  because our digital media services are designed to work in conjunction with various platforms and applications  we are susceptible to errors or defects in third party applications that can result in a lower quality service for our customers 
because our customers depend on us for digital media management  any interruptions could damage our reputation  cause our customers to initiate liability suits against us  increase our service development resources  cause us to lose revenue  and delay market acceptance of our digital media services 
we do not have product liability insurance  and our errors and omissions coverage is not likely to be sufficient to cover our complete liability exposure 
we provide guarantees to some of our customers under service level agreements and could be liable for service credits for failure to meet specified performance metrics 
in connection with our content protection services  we provide our customers with guaranteed service performance levels 
we also provide guaranteed service performance levels to some of our encoding customers 
if we fail to meet these guaranteed performance metrics  we could be liable for monetary credits or refunds of service fees previously paid or owed to us 
our contracts generally provide for credits 
table of contents of a portion of the fees otherwise payable to us for the service in the event of a service level failure 
any failure could also result in termination of service contracts and could damage our reputation and ability to attract or retain customers 
our network is subject to security and stability risks that could harm our business and reputation and expose us to litigation or liability 
online commerce and communications depend on the ability to transmit confidential information and licensed intellectual property securely over private and public networks 
any compromise of our ability to transmit such information and data securely or reliably  and any costs associated with preventing or eliminating such problems  could harm our business 
our systems and operations are susceptible to  and could be damaged or interrupted by a number of security and stability risks  including outages caused by fire  flood  power loss  telecommunications failure  internet breakdown  earthquake and similar events 
our systems are also subject to human error  security breaches  power losses  computer viruses  break ins  denial of service attacks  sabotage  intentional acts of vandalism and tampering designed to disrupt our computer systems  websites and network communications 
a sudden and significant increase in traffic on our websites could strain the capacity of the software  hardware and telecommunications systems that we deploy or use 
this could lead to slower response times or system failures 
our operations also depend on receipt of timely feeds from our content providers  and any failure or delay in the transmission or receipt of such feeds could disrupt our operations 
we also depend on web browsers  isps and online service providers to provide access over the internet to our service offerings 
many of these providers have experienced significant outages or interruptions in the past  and could experience outages  delays and other difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems 
these types of interruptions could continue or increase in the future 
the occurrence of any of these or similar events could damage our business  hurt our ability to distribute services and collect revenue  threaten the proprietary or confidential nature of our technology  harm our reputation  and expose us to litigation or liability 
we may be required to expend significant capital or other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches  hacker attacks or system malfunctions or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches  attacks or failures 
our services are complex and are deployed in complex environments and therefore may have errors or defects that could seriously harm our business 
our services are highly complex and are designed to be deployed in and across numerous large complex networks 
our digital distribution activities are managed by sophisticated software and computer systems 
from time to time  we have needed to correct errors and defects 
in addition  we must continually develop and update these systems over time as our business needs grow and change and these systems may not adequately reflect the current needs of our business 
we may encounter delays in developing these systems  and the systems may contain undetected errors and defects that could cause system failures 
any system error or failure that causes interruption in availability of services or content or an increase in response time could result in a loss of potential or existing customers  users  advertisers or content providers 
if we suffer sustained or repeated interruptions  our services and websites could be less attractive to such entities or individuals and our business could be harmed 
our transmission capacity is not entirely in our control  as we rely in part on transmission capacity provided by third parties 
insufficient transmission capacity could result in interruptions in our services and loss of revenue 
significant portions of our business are dependent on providing customers with efficient and reliable services to enable customers to broadcast content to large audiences on a live or on demand basis 
our operations are dependent in part upon transmission capacity provided by third party telecommunications network providers 
any failure of such network providers to provide the capacity we require may result in a reduction in  or interruption of  service to our customers 
if we do not have access to third party 
table of contents transmission capacity  we could lose customers and if we are unable to obtain such capacity on terms commercially acceptable to us  our business and operating results could suffer 
we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and we have received an adverse opinion on internal control over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm in connection with their annual internal control attestation process 
we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of december   including the following deficiencies pertaining to insufficiently skilled personnel and a lack of human resources within our finance and accounting reporting functions 
insufficient oversight of financially significant processes and systems  including deficiencies relating to monitoring and oversight of the work performed by our finance and accounting personnel 
deficiencies in the design of our internal control environment reflected in either a lack of controls or ineffectively designed controls 
deficiencies in our general computer controls relating to financially significant applications and business processes  including application level design and documentation deficiencies 
as a result of these deficiencies and our inability to rely upon information technology general controls to perform as expected over time  we were unable to demonstrate through testing that our information technology dependent controls were operating effectively 
deficiencies relating to insufficient analysis  review and documentation of the selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  to significant non routine transactions  including the preparation of financial statement disclosures relating thereto 
failure to appropriately assess and monitor the effectiveness of controls executed by third party service providers  and to adequately implement and or maintain customer level controls related to the provision of services by third party service providers 
inability to demonstrate through testing that all of our key internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of december  deficiencies related to entity level controls 
our independent registered public accounting firm  moss adams llp  has issued an adverse opinion on our internal control over financial reporting as of december  the existence of a material weakness is an indication that there is more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected in the current or any future period 
our operations could be harmed by factors including political instability  natural disasters  fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in regulations that govern international transactions 
as a result of our acquisition of od  we have substantial international operations  including in the united kingdom  france  germany and italy 
the risks inherent in international trade may reduce our international sales and harm our business and the businesses of our customers and our suppliers 
these risks include changes in tariff regulations  political instability  war  terrorism and other political risks  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  establishing and maintaining relationships with local distributors and dealers  
table of contents lengthy accounts receivable payment cycles  import and export licensing requirements  compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations  including unexpected changes in taxation and regulatory requirements  greater difficulty in safeguarding intellectual property than in the us  challenges caused by distance  language and cultural differences  potentially adverse tax consequences  difficulty in staffing and managing geographically diverse operations  and higher costs associated with doing business internationally 
these and other risks may preclude or curtail international sales or increase the relative price of our services compared to those of local competitors in other countries  reducing the demand for our services 
our business and operations may be especially subject to the risks of earthquakes and other natural catastrophes in the pacific northwest 
our us computer and communications infrastructure is located at a single leased facility in seattle  washington  an area that is at heightened risk of earthquake and volcanic events 
we do not have fully redundant systems  and we may not have adequate business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur from a system outage 
despite our efforts  our network infrastructure and systems could be subject to service interruptions or damage and any resulting interruption of services could harm our business  operating results and reputation 
risks related to our industry digital media distribution services in general are new and rapidly evolving and may not prove to be viable business models 
digital media distribution services are a relatively new business model for delivering digital media over electronic mediums  including the internet 
it is too early to predict whether consumers will accept online music services in significant numbers and accordingly whether the services will be financially viable 
if digital media distribution services do not prove to be popular with consumers  or if these services cannot sustain any such popularity  our business and prospects would be harmed 
we must provide digital rights management solutions that are acceptable to both content providers and consumers 
we must also provide digital rights management solutions and other security mechanisms in order to address concerns of content providers and artists  and we cannot be certain that we can develop  license or acquire such solutions  or that content licensors or consumers will accept them 
consumers may be unwilling to accept the use of digital rights management technologies that limit their use of content  especially with large amounts of free content readily available 
no assurance can be given that such solutions will be available to us upon reasonable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to acquire these solutions on reasonable or any terms  or if customers are unwilling to accept these solutions  our business and prospects could be harmed 
the industries we serve are a focus of attempts at means to improperly access and share content and avoid digital rights management and anti piracy technologies 
we employ content protection and anti piracy technologies and systems that are state of the art in the industry 
however  the digital content businesses we serve are a focus of escalating attempts by third parties to circumvent these technologies and systems in an apparent effort to illegally use and share digital 
table of contents content  such as digital music  video  films and commercial software programs 
to the extent third parties are successful in avoiding our content protection technologies and systems and if it is not feasible for us to modify or enhance our technologies and systems to avoid that result  our business  result of operations and reputation could be harmed 
our industry is experiencing consolidation that may intensify competition 
the internet and digital media services industries are undergoing substantial change that has resulted in increasing consolidation and a proliferation of strategic transactions 
many companies in these industries have failed or are being acquired by larger entities 
as a result  we are increasingly competing with larger competitors which have substantially greater resources than we do 
we expect this consolidation and strategic partnering to continue 
acquisitions or strategic relationships could harm us in a number of ways 
for example competitors could acquire or enter into relationships with companies with which we have strategic relationships and discontinue our relationship  resulting in the loss of distribution opportunities for our services or the loss of certain enhancements or value added features to our services  competitors could obtain exclusive access to desirable multimedia content and prevent that content from being available in certain formats  thus impairing our content selection and our ability to attract customers  suppliers of important or emerging technologies could be acquired by a competitor or other company which could prevent us from being able to utilize such technologies in our offerings  and disadvantage our offerings relative to those of competitors  a competitor could be acquired by a party with significant resources and experience that could increase the ability of the competitor to compete with our services  and other companies with related interests could combine to form new  formidable competition  which could preclude us from obtaining access to certain markets or content  or which could significantly change the market for our services 
any of these results could put us at a competitive disadvantage that could cause us to lose customers  revenue and market share 
they could also force us to expend greater resources to meet the competitive threat  which could also harm our operating results 
our business could be harmed by a lack of availability of popular content 
our digital media services business is affected by the release of hit music titles  which can create cyclical trends in sales distinctive to the music industry 
it is not possible to determine the timing of these cycles or the future availability of hit titles 
we depend upon the music content providers to continue to produce hits 
to the extent that new hits are not available  or not available at prices attractive to consumers  our sales and margins may be adversely affected 
the growth of our business depends on the increased use of the internet and wireless networks for communications  electronic commerce and advertising 
the growth of our business depends on the continued growth of the internet and wireless networks as a medium for media consumption  communications  electronic commerce and advertising 
our business will be harmed if such usage does not continue to grow  particularly as a source of media information and entertainment and as a vehicle for commerce 
our success also depends on the efforts of third parties to develop the infrastructure and complementary services necessary to maintain and expand the internet and wireless networks as viable commercial channels  and identifying additional viable revenue models for digital media based businesses 
we believe that other internet related issues  such as security  privacy  reliability  cost  speed  ease of use and access  quality of service  and necessary increases in bandwidth availability and access on an affordable basis  remain largely unresolved and may affect the amount and 
table of contents type of business that is conducted over such mediums  and may adversely affect our ability to sell our services and ultimately impact our business results and prospects 
if usage of the internet and wireless networks grows  the respective infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on them by such growth  specifically the demands of delivering high quality media content 
as a result  the performance and reliability of such mediums may decline 
in addition  the internet and wireless networks have experienced interruptions in service as a result of outages  system attacks and other delays occurring throughout the relevant network infrastructure 
if these outages  attacks or delays occur frequently or on a broad scale in the future  overall usage  as well as the usage of our services could grow more slowly or decline 
if broadband technologies do not become widely available or widely adopted  our online media distribution services may not achieve broad market acceptance  and our business may be harmed 
we believe that increased internet use and especially the increased use of media over the internet may depend on the availability of greater bandwidth or data transmission speeds also known as broadband transmission 
if broadband technologies do not become widely available or widely adopted  our online media distribution services may not achieve broad market acceptance and our business and prospects could be harmed 
congestion over the internet and data loss may interrupt audio and video streams  resulting in unsatisfying user experiences 
the success of digital media distribution over the internet depends on the continued rollout of broadband access to consumers on an affordable basis 
to date  we believe that broadband technologies have been adopted at a slower rate than expected  which we believe has delayed broader based adoption of the internet as a media distribution medium 
our business and prospects may be harmed if the rate of adoption does not increase 
more consumers are utilizing non pc devices to access digital content  and we may not be successful in developing versions of our services that will gain widespread adoption by users of such devices 
in the coming years  the number of individuals who access digital content through devices other than a personal computer  such as portable digital audio players  personal digital assistants  cellular telephones  television set top devices  game consoles and internet appliances  may increase dramatically 
manufacturers of these types of products are increasingly investing in media related applications  but these devices are in an early stage of development and business models are new and unproven 
if we are unable to offer our services on these alternative non pc devices  we may fail to capture a sufficient share of an increasingly important portion of the market for digital media services or our costs may increase significantly 
our digital music store service is not compatible with the ipod music player  the current digital audio player market leader 
government regulation could adversely affect our business prospects 
few existing laws or regulations specifically apply to the internet  other than laws and regulations generally applicable to businesses 
certain us export controls and import controls of other countries  including controls on the use of encryption technologies  may apply to our services 
many laws and regulations  however  are pending and may be adopted in the united states  european countries  and other countries  and in states  provinces and local jurisdictions  with respect to the internet 
these laws may relate to many areas that impact our business  including content issues such as obscenity  indecency and defamation  copyright and other intellectual property rights  digital rights management  encryption  caching of content by server products  personal privacy  taxation  e mail  sweepstakes  promotions  network and information security and the convergence of traditional communication services with internet communications  including the future availability of broadband transmission capability and wireless networks 
these types of regulations are likely to differ between countries and other political and geographic divisions 
other countries and political organizations are likely to impose or favor more and different regulation than that which has been proposed in the united states  thus furthering the complexity of regulation 
in addition  state and local governments may impose regulations in addition to  inconsistent with  or stricter than federal regulations 
the adoption of such laws or regulations  and uncertainties 
table of contents associated with their validity  interpretation  applicability and enforcement  may affect the available distribution channels for and costs associated with our services  and may affect the growth of the internet 
such laws or regulations may harm our business 
our services may also become subject to investigation and regulation of foreign data protection and e commerce authorities  including those in the european union 
such activities could result in additional distribution costs for us in order to comply with such regulation 
there is uncertainty regarding how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  copyright and other intellectual property issues  digital rights management  taxation  gambling  security  illegal or obscene content  retransmission of media  and personal privacy and data protection apply to the internet 
the vast majority of such laws were adopted before the advent of the internet and related technologies and do not address the unique issues associated with the internet and related technologies 
most of the laws that relate to the internet have not yet been interpreted 
in addition to potential legislation from local  state and federal governments  labor guild agreements and other laws and regulations that impose fees  royalties or unanticipated payments regarding the distribution of media over the internet may directly or indirectly affect our business 
while we and our customers may be directly affected by such agreements  we are not a party to such agreements and have little ability to influence the degree such agreements favor or disfavor internet distribution or our business models 
changes to or the interpretation of these laws and the entry into such industry agreements could limit the growth of the internet  create uncertainty in the marketplace that could reduce demand for our services  increase our cost of doing business  expose us to increased litigation risk  substantial defense costs and significant liabilities associated with content available on our websites or distributed or accessed through our services  with our provision of services  and with the features or performance of our services and websites  lead to increased development costs or otherwise harm our business  or decrease the rate of growth of our user base and limit our ability to effectively communicate with and market to our user base 
the digital millennium copyright act  or dmca  includes statutory licenses for the performance of sound recordings and for the making of recordings to facilitate transmissions 
under these statutory licenses  we and our broadcast customers may be required to pay licensing fees for digital sound recordings we deliver in original and archived programming and through retransmissions of radio broadcasts 
the dmca does not specify the rate and terms of the licenses  which are determined by arbitration proceedings  known as carp proceedings  supervised by the us copyright office 
past carp proceedings have resulted in proposed rates for statutory webcasting that were significantly in excess of rates requested by webcasters 
carp proceedings relating to music subscription and non subscription services offering music programming that qualify for various licenses under us copyright law are pending 
with the enactment of the copyright royalty and distribution reform act of on november   the carp system that had been part of the us copyright office since is being phased out 
the act replaced carp with a system of three copyright royalty judges  who will determine rates and terms for the copyright statutory licenses and make determinations on distribution of statutory license royalties collected by the us copyright office 
we cannot predict the outcome of continuing carp proceedings or any proceedings before the copyright royalty judges and may elect instead to directly license music content for our subscription and or non subscription services  either alone or in concert with other affected companies 
such licenses may apply only to music performed in the united states  and the availability of corresponding licenses for international performances is unclear 
therefore  our ability to find rights holders and negotiate appropriate licenses is uncertain 
many of our customers may be affected by these rates  which may negatively affect our revenue 
several carp proceedings are pending for subscription music 
table of contents services and services that deliver digital downloads of music  and the outcome of these carps or any proceedings before the copyright royalty judges will also likely affect our business in ways that we cannot predict 
depending on the rates and terms adopted for the statutory licenses  our business could be harmed both by increasing our own cost of doing business  as well as by increasing the cost of doing business for our customers 
we anticipate future proceedings before copyright royalty judges relating to music subscription delivery services  which may also adversely affect the online distribution of music 
the child online privacy protection act imposes liability on persons collecting personal information from children under the age of the child online protection act imposes civil and criminal penalties on persons distributing material harmful to minors over the internet to persons under the age of the manner in which these acts may be interpreted and enforced cannot be fully determined 
for example  while the supreme court recently upheld an injunction of the enforcement of the child online protection act because it likely violates the first amendment of the us constitution  it is possible that the courts will ultimately find the act enforceable 
if the child online protection act is ultimately found to be unenforceable it is possible that congress would enact new legislation aimed at preventing the distribution of materials that might be harmful to minors 
if it is determined that we fail to conform to any such law we could face fines or civil penalties 
there are a large number of legislative proposals before the united states congress and various state legislatures regarding intellectual property  digital rights management  copy protection requirements  privacy  email marketing and security issues related to our business 
it is not possible to predict whether or when such legislation may be adopted  and certain proposals  if adopted  could materially and adversely affect our business through a decrease in user registration and revenue  and influence how and whether we can communicate with our customers 
we may be subject to market risk and legal liability in connection with the data collection capabilities of our services 
many of our services leverage interactive applications that by their very nature require communication between a client and server to operate 
to provide better consumer experiences and to operate effectively  our services send information to servers 
many of the services we provide also require that a user provide certain information to us 
we post an extensive privacy policy concerning the collection  use and disclosure of user data involved in interactions between our client and server products 
any failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policy and existing or new legislation regarding privacy issues could impact the market for our services  subject us to litigation and harm our business 
risks related to our common stock our future capital raising activities could involve the issuance of equity securities  which would dilute your investment and could result in a decline in the trading price of our common stock 
we may sell securities in the public or private equity markets if and when conditions are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time 
raising funds through the issuance of equity securities will dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders 
furthermore  we may enter into financing transactions at prices that represent a substantial discount to the market price of our common stock 
a negative reaction by investors and securities analysts to any discounted sale of our equity securities could result in a decline in the trading price of our common stock 
some provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended bylaws and of delaware law may deter takeover attempts  which may limit the opportunity of our stockholders to sell their shares at a favorable price 
some of the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders by providing them with the opportunity to sell their shares possibly at a premium over the then market price 

table of contents for example  our board of directors is divided into three classes 
at each annual meeting of stockholders  the terms of approximately one third of the directors will expire  and new directors will be elected to serve for three years 
it will take at least two annual meetings to effect a change in control of our board of directors because a majority of the directors cannot be elected at a single meeting  which may discourage hostile takeover bids 
in addition  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock 
the preferred stock may be issued in one or more series  the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by our board of directors without further action by the stockholders 
these terms may include voting rights including the right to vote as a series on particular matters  preferences as to dividends and liquidation  conversion rights  redemption rights and sinking fund provisions 
no shares of preferred stock are currently outstanding and we have no present plans for the issuance of any preferred stock 
the issuance of any preferred stock  however  could diminish the rights of holders of our common stock  and therefore could reduce the value of our common stock 
in addition  specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with  or sell assets to  a third party 
the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock could make it more difficult  delay  discourage  prevent or make it more costly to acquire or effect a change in control  thereby preserving the current stockholders control 
our amended bylaws contain provisions that require stockholders to act only at a duly called meeting and make it difficult for any person other than management to introduce business at a duly called meeting by requiring such other person to follow certain notice procedures 
finally  we are also subject to section of the delaware general corporation law which  subject to certain exceptions  prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder 
the preceding provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as section of the delaware general corporation law  could discourage potential acquisition proposals  delay or prevent a change of control and prevent changes in our management  even if such things would be in the best interests of our stockholders 
securities analysts may not continue to cover our common stock or may issue negative reports  and this may have a negative impact on our common stock s market price 
there is no guarantee that securities analysts will continue to cover our common stock 
if securities analysts do not cover our common stock  the lack of research coverage may adversely affect our common stock s market price 
the trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about our business or us 
if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrades our stock  our stock price may decline rapidly 
if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company  we could lose visibility in the market  which in turn could cause our stock price to decline 
in addition  recently adopted rules mandated by the sarbanes oxley act of  and a global settlement reached between the sec  other regulatory analysts and a number of investment banks in april  may lead to a number of fundamental changes in how analysts are reviewed and compensated 
in particular  many investment banking firms will now be required to contract with independent financial analysts for their stock research 
it may be difficult for companies with smaller market capitalizations  such as our company  to attract independent financial analysts that will cover our common stock  which could have a negative effect on our market price 
market fluctuations and volatility could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline and limit our ability to raise capital 
our common stock trades on the nasdaq smallcap market 
our common stock has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations to date 
to illustrate  during our past two fiscal years  the highest closing sales price for our common stock was  while the lowest closing sales price was 
in the 
table of contents future  the market price and trading volume of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to general market conditions and in response to quarter to quarter variations in our anticipated or actual operating results  developments concerning our technologies and market offerings  technological innovations or setbacks by us or our competitors  conditions in the digital media and internet markets  announcements of merger or acquisition transactions  and other events or factors and general economic and market conditions 
in the past  securities class action litigation has been brought against companies that experienced volatility in the trading price of their securities 
market fluctuations in the price of our common stock could also adversely affect our ability to sell equity securities at a price we deem appropriate 
future sales of our common stock  or the perception that future sales could occur  may adversely affect our common stock price 
if a large number of shares of our common stock are sold in the open market  or if there is a perception that such sales could occur  the trading price of our common stock could decline materially 
in addition  the sale of these shares  or possibility of such sale  could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional shares of common stock 
as of march   we had on file with the sec effective registration statements for a total of approximately million shares for resale by selling stockholders representing approximately of our common stock then outstanding 
of these shares registered  approximately million had been resold as of march   and approximately million shares remained available for resale 
we have on file with the sec a registration statement covering the resale of  shares issued or issuable upon exercise of warrants issued in connection with our acquisition of od and our december financing transactions 
we are also obligated to file a registration statement to cover the resale of  shares of our common stock issuable by us to former shareholders of od sales of shares pursuant to exercisable options and warrants could also lead to subsequent sales of the shares in the public market 
these sales  together with sales of shares by the selling stockholders  could depress the market price of our stock by creating an excess in supply of shares for sale 
availability of these shares for sale in the public market could also impair our ability to raise capital by selling equity securities 
we are not compliant with listing standards of the nasdaq stock market requiring a majority of our directors to be independent and that our audit committee consists of at least three independent directors 
on february   we received a notice from the nasdaq stock market that we no longer comply with nasdaq s independent director and audit committee requirements as set forth in nasdaq marketplace rule  which include that our board must consist of a majority of independent directors and that we must have at least three independent directors on our audit committee 
consistent with marketplace rules c and d  we have a cure period until the earlier of our next annual meeting of stockholders or january   in order to regain compliance 
in the event we do not regain compliance within this period  the nasdaq stock market has informed us that the staff of the nasdaq stock market will provide us with a written notification that our shares will be delisted and  at that time  we may appeal such determination to delist to a nasdaq listings qualifications panel 
we are currently conducting a search process to identify qualified individuals to join our board of directors and certain committees of our board of directors  including our audit committee  in order to regain compliance with these requirements 

table of contents if our stock price trades below per share for an extended period of time we may be delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market 
in september and october  our common stock traded at prices below per share 
if our stock price trades below per share for an extended period  it may be delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market  which would have an adverse effect on our business and on the trading of our common stock 
in order to maintain compliance with nasdaq smallcap listing standards  we may consider several strategies 
for example  at our annual meeting  we intend to submit to a stockholder vote a proposal to approve a potential reverse stock split 
we cannot predict what effect a reverse stock split would have on the market price of our common stock or our ability to maintain compliance with the listing standards of the nasdaq smallcap market 
if a delisting of our common stock were to occur  our common stock would trade on the otc bulletin board or in the pink sheets maintained by the national quotation bureau  inc such alternatives are generally considered to be less efficient markets  and our stock price  as well as the liquidity of our common stock  may be adversely impacted as a result 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations have increased and will continue to increase our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of along with other recent and proposed rules from the sec and nasdaq have required changes in our corporate governance  public disclosure and compliance practices 
many of these new requirements have increased and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs  and make some corporate actions more difficult 
these developments could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
these developments also could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and members of our board of directors 
the large number of holders and lack of concentration of ownership of our common stock may make it difficult for us to reach a quorum or obtain an affirmative vote of our stockholders at future stockholder meetings 
our stock is held in a large number of individual accounts with no one registered holder or group of registered holders individually accounting for more than of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  it may be difficult for us to reach a quorum or obtain an affirmative vote of a majority of our stockholders where either of those thresholds are measured based on the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding 
difficulty in obtaining a stockholder vote could impact our ability to complete any strategic transaction requiring stockholder approval or effect basic corporate governance changes  such as an increase in the authorized number of shares of our common stock 
as a result of accounting regulations which become applicable to us on july  requiring companies to expense stock options  our expenses will increase and our stock price may decline 
a number of publicly traded companies have recently announced that they will begin expensing stock option grants to employees 
in addition  the financial accounting standards board fasb has adopted rule changes with an effective date beginning july  requiring expensing of stock options 
currently  we include such expenses on a pro forma basis in the notes to our annual financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  but do not include stock option expense for employee options in our reported financial statements 
this change in accounting standards will require us to expense stock options  and as a result our reported expenses may increase significantly

table of contents mr 
morgenstern with prejudice and dismissed the complaint against loudeye and overpeer without prejudice 
the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on november  against loudeye  overpeer and other entity defendants 
loudeye and overpeer filed motions to dismiss this amended complaint  which the court denied on january  we intend to file a motion for summary judgment and to otherwise defend ourselves vigorously against the allegations contained in the amended complaint 
discovery in this matter commenced in january at present  we cannot assess the probability of an unfavorable outcome or the magnitude of any such outcome 
in february  we entered into an agreement with regent pacific management corporation pursuant to which regent pacific would provide management services 
the agreement was for a term of weeks  with an option to renegotiate certain terms of the agreement after weeks  and was terminable by either party under certain circumstances 
under the agreement  we paid certain cash fees to regent pacific 
in addition  regent pacific was to receive stock options to purchase up to  shares of loudeye common stock based on regent pacific s length of service 
these options were to be granted at various times throughout their engagement at exercise prices based on the closing market price on each grant date 
in march  regent pacific resigned from the engagement 
in july  regent pacific filed suit against us in the superior court of california in san francisco county for breach of the agreement 
in this complaint  regent pacific is seeking unspecified damages and specific performance of the alleged obligation to grant the stock options due to them under the contract 
we answered the complaint in september denying all allegations and asserting counterclaims 
in march  the court granted our motion to transfer the case to the united states district court for the western district of washington 
discovery in this case is ongoing  with depositions scheduled for april and may we intend to defend vigorously this action and to pursue vigorously our counterclaims 
we do not consider the likelihood of loss to be probable and the amount of loss  if any  is not estimable at this time 
between january and december   class action complaints were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
these actions were filed against issuers including us  underwriters and numerous individuals including certain of our former officers and directors 
the various complaints were filed purportedly on behalf of a class of persons who purchased our common stock during the time period between march and december  the complaints allege violations of the securities act of and the securities exchange act of  primarily based on allegations that our underwriters received undisclosed compensation in connection with our initial public offering and that the underwriters entered into undisclosed arrangements with some investors that were designed to distort and or inflate the market price for our common stock in the aftermarket 
these actions were consolidated for pre trial purposes 
no specific amount of damages has been claimed 
we and the individual defendants have demanded to be indemnified by underwriter defendants pursuant to the underwriting agreement entered into at the time of the initial public offering 
presently all claims against the former officers have been withdrawn without prejudice 
the court suggested that the parties select six test cases to determine class action eligibility 
we are not a party to any of the test cases 
in march  a proposed settlement initially structured in june among plaintiffs  issuer defendants  issuer officers and directors named as defendants  and issuers insurance companies  was approved by the court 
this proposed settlement provides  among other matters  that issuer defendants and related individual defendants will be released from the litigation without any liability other than certain expenses incurred to date in connection with the litigation  issuer defendants insurers will guarantee billion in recoveries by plaintiff class members  issuer defendants will assign certain claims against underwriter defendants to the plaintiff class members  and issuer defendants will have the opportunity to recover certain litigation related expenses if plaintiffs recover more than billion from underwriter defendants 
the final settlement terms as approved by the court differ from the initial settlement proposal in that the settlement does not bar the defendant underwriters from bringing contractual indemnity claims against the 
table of contents issuer defendants  including loudeye 
our board of directors approved the proposed settlement in august and is considering whether to approve the final settlement terms in march management does not anticipate that we will be required to pay any amounts under this settlement  however  we can give no assurance that the underwriter defendants will not bring a claim for indemnification against us under the terms of the underwriting agreement relating to our initial public offering 
we are involved from time to time in various other claims and lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course of our operations  including contract and lease disputes and complaints alleging employment discrimination 
we believe that the outcome of any such other pending claims or proceedings  individually or in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect upon our business or financial condition  cash flows  or results of operations

the loudeye solution the use of the internet and wireless networks as a medium for media distribution has continued to evolve and grow in recent years 
traditional media and entertainment companies  such as major record labels  have in recent years faced significant challenges associated with the digital distribution of music

additionally  retailers and advertisers have expanded their use of digital content in the marketing and selling of their products and services 
as such  traditional distribution channels for media have expanded as content owners have begun to license and distribute their content online and over wireless networks through new and existing retail channels  and consumers have begun to purchase and consume content using personal computers  mobile devices and other digital devices

table of contents the following is a description of our digital media services segment and our media restoration services segment 
digital media services segment 
we currently have three primary service offerings in our digital media services segment digital media store services  core services and content protection services 
our business model provides for a blend of higher margin revenue  generated by each of our service lines  and lower margin  yet scalable  revenue generated by the digital download and e commerce of our digital media store services 
a more detailed description of each of our major service offerings follows 
digital media store services 
digital media store services include our end to end digital music store solution provided on a white labeled basis to retailers and brands throughout the world

our services include hosting  publishing and managing digital media content  and delivering such content to end consumers on behalf of our customers 
our services support private label user interfaces and customized templates  and can readily function across both internet and mobile delivery protocols

our end to end solution provides fully integrated payment functionality supporting multiple end consumer payment alternatives as well as support for multiple languages  offering multinational customers a worldwide solution 
we expect to extend our store services offerings from our established base in music stores to other digital media  such as video  music video and games 
we derive revenue from our music store services through platform service fees and transaction related distribution or revenue sharing fees 
platform service fees represent charges in connection with enabling the service and maintaining its overall functionality during the term of the customer contract  including customer support  merchandising  publishing and other content management related services that we provide during the contract term 
we also receive a percentage of our customers retailing revenues generated from the sale of content to the end consumer  which provides for a scaleable revenue stream and enables us to share directly in the success of our customers music store services that we enable and manage 
as part of our end to end music store solutions  we have secured licenses and cultivated relationships with the four major recorded music companies and hundreds of independent record labels around the globe 
our rights portfolio currently available for inclusion in our music store solution encompasses licenses in over countries and more than million individual tracks available for sale by our customers to end consumers 
core services 
core services include a suite of digital media services provided to both content owners and retailers 
we generate the majority of our revenue in this area from fees for encoding and fulfillment services we perform for emi music and various independent label catalogs  and from our leading samples service 
within core services  we provide a variety of back end services to most of the digital music services that have launched in the last few years 
examples of these services include digital media supply chain services 
our proprietary systems and technology enable the scalable archiving and retrieval of large libraries of digital media assets  or digital content 
digitized masters of the media assets are stored on our high capacity storage array systems and accessed 
table of contents via our proprietary  automated  web based access tools to search  deliver and manage such content 
such storage and access capabilities enable digital content to be processed and converted into different digital formats pursuant to our customers specifications via our proprietary encoding and transcoding systems 
to transmit digital content over the internet or other advanced digital distribution networks  the uncompressed  digitized content must be converted into compressed  network compatible digital formats 
our encoding services enable the conversion of such content into a particular form  along with the relevant metadata  such that the content can be readily and rapidly distributed over various distribution networks 
encoding large catalogs of content in an efficient manner is a complex process that requires highly scalable technology and supporting infrastructures 
digital encoding formats and technologies continue to evolve and often conflict with one another 
as a result  content owners often convert their digital assets into multiple formats and codecs which are algorithms that reduce the number of bytes consumed by large files and programs to support their distribution strategies 
additionally  the encoding process for a particular item or for an entire library is often repeated as a result of the introduction of new formats or distribution platforms 
our innovative digital media supply chain services address these challenges by providing an outsourced solution for the archiving  management  processing and distribution of our customers digital assets 
our digital media supply chain services also provide watermarking  encryption  metadata and other digital rights management services to enable our customers to protect and manage their content digitally 
we also provide project analysis  as well as consulting and other related services to support the digital fulfillment of encoded content libraries for content owners and retailers worldwide

we also provide an interactive radio service  or iradio

the iradio service can be deployed online for web based retailers and portals  as well as offline for consumer electronic devices and appliances  digital home entertainment systems and other digital broadcasting outlets 
content protection services 
content protection services include our anti piracy services provided to content owners to protect against the unauthorized distribution of content on peer to peer networks 
our content protection services provide a comprehensive solution to combat the proliferation of illegal content sharing and download typically found on peer to peer networks on a global basis 
the services  which are available globally  include titanium  a service featuring the industry s leading anti piracy service level agreement sla guaranteeing up to effectiveness in preventing the illegal sharing of digital content over peer to peer networks 
our services also include providing content owners powerful data mining and analytical tools and comprehensive information on digital media usage and sharing on peer to peer networks 
we also offer the potential of targeted promotional services redirecting potential consumers to legitimate services as a means for companies to capitalize on previously untapped revenue streams across content sharing networks 
we currently protect approximately  digital content titles and block hundreds of millions of download sessions each month  across all major peer to peer protocols 
media restoration services segment 
in january  we transferred substantially all of the assets of our media restoration services subsidiary  vidipax  inc  or vidipax  to a company controlled by vidipax s general manager 
in may  we completed the sale of this media restoration services business which involved restoring and migrating legacy media archives to current digital media formats 
while we will have ongoing rights to co market and resell media restoration services for two years after the sale  
table of contents media restoration services did not represent a significant portion of our revenue in  and we anticipate media restoration services will represent an insignificant portion of our revenue in the future 
significant trends and developments in our industry the media industry is in the midst of a significant transition 
business models are changing to incorporate the migration of media content from analog to digital and from physical packaging and distribution to digital distribution 
the changing business models reflect the increase in consumer adoption of broadband connectivity and the introduction of new consumer electronics devices  such as personal mp players  and the incorporation of new technologies and features in traditional devices 
along with these new consumer electronics devices  media formats and technologies have evolved at a rapid pace  and standards have not been established by the industry or marketplace 
finally  the emergence of peer to peer services and illegitimate file sharing  combined with the increased consumer adoption of digital media  has contributed to significant declines in physical cd sales in the music sector in recent years 
as a result  content owners are beginning to embrace the legitimate digital distribution channel 
to date  these trends have impacted primarily the music sector of the media industry  but we anticipate that the video sector will experience many of the same trends in the future 
adoption of digital distribution for video and film depends on increased saturation of high speed bandwidth within the consumer market and means of managing and storing larger digital files 
digital media distribution represents a significant challenge for companies that want to enter or stay competitive in the space 
problems to overcome include the following obtaining rights from content owners  obtaining access to digital masters of the content  supporting multiple competing digital media formats and codecs to meet the needs of competing media players  supporting multiple bit rates and quality levels for different internet connection speeds  supporting multiple content protection technologies  including digital rights management drm platforms  complex reporting and auditing requirements of content owners  obtaining local content rights  in particular across europe  supporting multiple languages and currencies  and significant upfront investment required to develop a comprehensive solution and continued investment to keep pace with technology changes and content additions 
acquisition of on demand distribution limited od in june  we commenced a tender offer to acquire of the outstanding shares of od  a privately held digital music service provider based in europe 
we acquired of the shares of od upon commencement of the tender offer 
as of august   we had acquired the remaining of od s shares on the same terms from the remaining shareholders of od in march  we completed a restructuring of future deferred and contingent consideration payment obligations to the former od shareholders 
the restructuring is discussed further below

although management believes such non gaap information enhances a reader s understanding of the od acquisition  this non gaap information does not reflect gaap accounting for the acquisition as of december  accordingly  readers should consider this non gaap information together with the gaap information set forth below  rather than as an alternative to gaap basis financial measures

we expect to issue up to  additional shares of our common stock  representing shares to be issued to od option holders upon exercise of od options that were assumed 
of such amount  options to purchase  shares of our common stock had been exercised as of december  from a financial accounting perspective  we issued  shares of our common stock in december to former od shareholders to satisfy the initial deferred consideration payment obligations totaling million approximately million based on exchange rates as of december  
on a non gaap basis  we issued a total of  shares our common stock in december  which includes  shares held in escrow 
these payments included satisfaction of the initial promissory note installments discussed further below 
certain of od s principal shareholders agreed to have an aggregate of of the total consideration payable in the transaction held in escrow by us for months to satisfy claims we may have with respect to breaches of representations  warranties and covenants and indemnification claims

from a financial accounting perspective  the escrow shares  including the million to be held in escrow in connection with the deferred consideration that had not been paid as of december  described above  are not recorded as liabilities and the value of the shares held in escrow and the consideration to be placed in escrow upon payment of the deferred consideration was not included in determining the cost of acquiring od as of december   since the resolution of the escrow shares and the additional consideration to be held in escrow upon payment of the deferred consideration is still pending 
we will reflect the escrow shares as outstanding and record the value of such shares and any additional consideration to be held in escrow as additional costs of acquiring od upon the earlier of the expiration of the month escrow period to the extent such shares and additional consideration are released from escrow or when management believes beyond a reasonable doubt that we will not state a claim pursuant to the terms of the escrow

this restructuring was agreed to by all of the former od shareholders entitled to receive additional deferred and contingent payment consideration and it satisfies in full those obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition substantially all of our revenue is derived from our digital media service offerings including digital media store services which include music store services  encoding services  content protection services  samples services  internet radio services  and live and on demand webcasting services 
in  we experienced a significant increase in deferred revenue which arises from payments received in advance of the culmination of the earnings process 
deferred revenue expected to be realized within the next twelve months is classified as current 
revenue from software license sales accounted for less than of our revenue in and less than of our revenues in we do not anticipate that software license sales 
table of contents will constitute a significant portion of our revenue in the future 
also  we recognized service revenue from media restoration services prior to our sale of that business in the first quarter our basis for revenue recognition is substantially governed by securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab  as superseded by sab  revenue recognition  the fasb s emerging issues task force issue no

software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position no 
  and related interpretations and technical practice aids sop 
we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of revenue and software license sales revenue to be recognized in each accounting period 
the adoption of sab in december did not materially affect our revenue recognition policies  results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
the following is a summary of the areas where we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of revenue to be recognized in each accounting period determining separate elements and allocating value to those elements 
if sufficient evidence of the fair values of the delivered and undelivered elements of an arrangement does not exist  revenue is deferred using revenue recognition principles applicable to the entire arrangement as if it were a single element arrangement under eitf  and is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
for arrangements with multiple deliverables which are determined to have separate units of accounting  revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate units in accordance with eitf consideration from multiple element arrangements is allocated among the separate elements based on their relative fair values 
in the event that there is no objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the delivered item  the revenue recognized upon delivery is the total arrangement consideration less the fair value of the undelivered items 
the maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items 
management applies significant judgment in establishing the fair value of multiple elements within revenue arrangements 
estimates of fair value represent our best estimate  but changes in circumstances relating to the services sold in these arrangements may result in one time revenue charges as future elements of the arrangements are delivered 
in the limited circumstances where we sell software products  we recognize revenue associated with the license of software in accordance with  sop under the provisions of sop  in software arrangements that involve rights to multiple services  we allocate the total arrangement consideration among each of the deliverables using the residual method  under which revenue is allocated to the undelivered elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of such undelivered elements 
vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately or  in the case of an element not sold separately  the price established by management  if it is probable that the price  once established  will not change before market introduction 
some of our arrangements may include consulting services sold separately under professional services contracts 
professional services arrangements are billed on a time and materials basis and accordingly  revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
digital media store services revenue 
digital media store services  including music store services  are our newest service offerings and grew significantly following our acquisition of od in june we charge our digital media store customers fixed platform fees which generally consist of enabling and hosting the service and maintenance of the service s overall functionality during the term of the customer contract 
platform services may include fees related to integration to a customer s website  wireless sites  inventory  account management  and commerce and billing systems 
additionally  platform fees associated with our digital media store services include digital rights management  editorial services  usage reporting  and digital content royalty settlement 
we charge platform fees to our customers in a variety of manners  including initial set up fees  monthly only fees  or a combination of initial set up and monthly fees 
in addition  we provide a number of transactional services  including cover art and metadata publishing  rich 
table of contents media ring tunes for wireless applications delivery  varied commerce and content consumption alternatives for digital media content  including pay as you go  permanent download  or la carte 
we follow the guidance in eitf for purposes of allocating the total consideration to the individual deliverables in our digital media store services arrangements 
we evaluate whether each of the elements in these arrangements represent a separate unit of accounting  as defined by eitf  using all applicable facts and circumstances  including whether i the delivered item s has value to the customer on a standalone basis  ii there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s and iii if there is a general right of return relative to the delivered item s  performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
if we determine there are separate units of accounting  we allocate the arrangement consideration to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  as determined by the price of the undelivered items when sold separately 
assuming all other criteria are met ie  evidence of an arrangement exists  collectibility is probable  and fees are fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as follows platform fees are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
revenues from permanent download  or la carte  are recognized at the time the content is delivered  digitally  to the consumer 
revenues from pay as you go are deferred and then recognized as tracks are downloaded by the consumer or as credits expire  whichever occurs earlier 
if evidence of fair value cannot be established for the undelivered elements of an agreement  the revenue from the arrangement is recognized ratably over the period that these elements are delivered or  if appropriate  under the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of direct labor hours incurred to date to total projected labor hours 
encoding services revenue 
encoding services consist of i processing and conversion of digital content into different digital formats pursuant to customers specifications via the company s proprietary encoding and transcoding systems and ii the delivery of such processed content to the customer 
the encoded content is either delivered electronically to a file transfer protocol ftp site that our customers access via a previously provided password or we physically ship the content to our customers 
in accordance with sab and eitf  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the service has been rendered  provided the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is deemed probable 
we evaluate each of these criteria as follows evidence of an arrangement we consider a non cancelable agreement signed by us and the customer to be evidence of an arrangement 
services have been rendered we consider this criteria to be satisfied when the content has been delivered 
fixed or determinable fee we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenue if all other revenue recognition requirements are met 
we consider these criteria to be satisfied when the payment terms associated with the transaction are within our normal payment terms 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after the date that fees would customarily be due under our normal payment terms  we consider the fee to not be fixed and determinable  and in such cases  we would defer revenue and recognize it when the fees become due and payable 
collection is deemed probable we initially assess the probability of collection to determine whether this criterion is satisfied based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the current financial condition of the customer 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer revenue until the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon the receipt of cash

on demand webcasting service fees are based on a contract with either set monthly minimum fees which entitle the customer to a monthly volume of stored and streamed data that is specified in the contract or a contract with charges based upon actual monthly volume of stored and streamed data with no monthly minimum fees 
additional fees are required to be paid under the contract if the volume of data streamed in a particular month exceeds the specified monthly volume threshold  and the per unit charges for the additional volume approximate the per unit charges for the minimum volumes 
any unused volume of streamed or stored data expires at each month end 
because we separately sell services for live webcast events and services for on demand webcasting  we have verifiable and objective evidence of the fair value for both the live and on demand services

 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed fas 
fas specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing computer software should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established 
once technological feasibility has been established  all software costs should be capitalized until the software is available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility is established 
marketable securities we account for marketable securities in accordance with fas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and sab  accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities  which provide guidance on determining when an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment 
this determination requires significant judgment 
in making this judgment  we evaluate  among other factors  the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost  the financial health of and near term business outlook for the investee  including factors such as industry and sector performance  changes in technology  and operational and financing cash flow  and our intent and ability to hold the investment 
investments with an indicator would be further evaluated to determine the likelihood of a significant adverse effect on the fair value and amount of the impairment as necessary 
to date  we have not recognized any impairment related to our long term marketable securities portfolio 
if market  industry and or investee conditions deteriorate  we may incur future impairments 
accounts receivable the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we perform a periodic analysis to determine the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts 
this analysis includes various analytical procedures and a review of factors  including individual review of past due balances over days and greater than a specified amount  our history of collections  as well as the overall economic environment

accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when doing so  management is required to evaluate the recoverability of an asset s or group of assets carrying value through estimates of undiscounted future cash flows 
if the assets are deemed impaired  the assets are written down to estimated fair value 
estimates of fair value may differ from the actual amount that could be realized if we were to sell our assets 

table of contents at december   net property and equipment totaling million  intangible assets totaling million and goodwill totaling million were subject to an impairment review 
we account for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
under fas  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to  at a minimum  annual impairment tests 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill and intangibles on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value is less than its carrying value 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following poor economic performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry  economic or company specific trends  changes in the manner of our use of the assets or the plans for our business  market price of our common stock  and loss of key personnel 
these charges are discussed in greater detail in note to our consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have recorded goodwill and intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions of overpeer in march and od in june we performed our annual impairment tests for and did not record an impairment charge 
we performed our annual impairment tests for and and recorded resulting impairment charges 
purchase price allocation we account for acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  any assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values 
the recorded values of assets and liabilities are based on third party estimates and independent valuations 
the remaining values are based on management s judgments and estimates 
accordingly  our financial position or results of operations may be affected by changes in estimates and judgments used to value these assets and liabilities 
accounting for stock based compensation we account for employee stock and stock based compensation plans through the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb opinion no

copyright law generally does not specify the rate and terms of the licenses  which are determined by voluntary negotiations among the parties or  for certain compulsory licenses where voluntary negotiations are unsuccessful  by arbitration 
there are certain geographies and agencies for which we have not yet completed negotiations with regard to the royalty rate to be applied to our current or historic sales of our digital music offerings 
our estimates are based on contracted or statutory rates  when established  or management s best estimates based on facts and circumstances regarding the specific music services and agreements in similar geographies or with similar agencies 
while we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents contingencies we become involved from time to time in various claims and lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course of our operations  including such matters as contract and lease disputes and complaints alleging employment discrimination 
the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty 
fas no 
 accounting for contingencies  requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
in determining whether a loss should be accrued  we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of loss 
changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations 
income taxes fas no 
 accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the periods in which the differences are expected to reverse 
our net deferred tax asset has been reduced by a full valuation allowance based upon management s determination that the criteria for recognition have not been met 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued statement no 
r  share based payment  that amends fas and fas no 
 and supersedes apb this statement requires a company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments  such as stock options  based on the grant date fair value of the award and to recognize such cost over the requisite period during which an employee provides service 
the grant date fair value will be determined using option pricing models adjusted for unique characteristics of the equity instruments 
the statement also addresses the accounting for transactions in which a company incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the company s equity instruments or that may be settled through the issuance of such equity instruments 
the statement does not change the accounting for transactions in which a company issues equity instruments for services to non employees or the accounting for employee stock ownership plans 
this statement is effective beginning in the third quarter of  and requires loudeye to recognize compensation costs on outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered 
while loudeye expects the implementation of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements  loudeye is currently unable to quantify this impact as it has not implemented the necessary option expensing software

table of contents functionality during the term of the customer contract  which is generally one to three years 
we charge platform fee to our customers in a variety of manners  including initial set up fees  monthly only fees  or a combination of initial set up and monthly fees

digital media store services revenue as a percentage of total revenue was in and in in the fourth quarter  digital media store services revenue increased significantly from million in the third quarter of to million in the fourth quarter  an increase primarily attributable to increased transactional volume from our music store services 
this revenue accounted for approximately of total revenue in the fourth quarter as compared to in the third quarter we expect that our digital media distribution services will demonstrate a faster growth rate than any of our other revenue lines as we continue to deploy these services globally and consumer adoption increases 
in addition  although in our digital media store services revenue consisted exclusively of music store services revenue  we plan to extend our store services offerings to other media  such as video  music video and games

of the shares issued in the transaction  initially  were held in escrow through march  under the terms of an escrow agreement to satisfy indemnity claims under the merger agreement 
in january  one of the former overpeer shareholders substituted  in cash for  of the shares held in escrow  resulting in a remaining escrow balance of  in cash and  shares of common stock 
in february  we delivered notice to the escrow agent and representative of the former overpeer stockholders of claims for breach of representations and warranties under the merger agreement 
as a result  the escrow cash and shares will remain in escrow until loudeye and the representative of the former overpeer stockholders resolve the claims against escrow in accordance with the terms of the escrow agreement 
we are subject to various debt covenants and other restrictions  including the requirement for early repayment upon the occurrence of certain events  including a sale or transfer of ownership or control 
if we violate these covenants or restrictions  our lenders could require repayment of outstanding borrowings and our credit rating and access to other financing could be adversely affected 
we were notified by silicon valley bank on october  that we were not in compliance with two restrictive financial covenants that require us to maintain a certain quick ratio and a minimum tangible net worth  each as defined in the loan agreement 
we subsequently established a certificate of deposit in the amount of approximately million  which was equal to the then outstanding loan balance 
as a result  we were notified by silicon valley bank on october  that we had cured the default within the cure period 
the restricted balance declines as we make payments under the term loan agreement 
as a result  we have reflected restricted cash of million on our december  balance sheet 
as of march  we were not in compliance with both of these restrictive financial covenants and  as such  continue to maintain the balance of restricted cash as collateral for our term loan balance with silicon valley bank in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement 
in addition  at december   approximately  of other restricted cash is held in investment accounts that serve as collateral for standby letters of credit for certain of our capital and operating lease obligations 
we have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and had an accumulated deficit of approximately million at december  historically  we have funded our operations through sales of equity securities  borrowings under our credit facilities and proceeds from exercises of stock options and warrants 
however  there can be no assurance that our cash balances after december  will be sufficient to sustain our operations until profitable operations and positive cash flows are achieved 
we currently anticipate that we will continue to experience fluctuations in results of operations for the foreseeable future as we enter new markets for our services  including through potential acquisitions of complementary businesses  technology or other assets  increase or decrease research and development spending  
table of contents increase or decrease sales and marketing activities  improve our operational and financial systems  and integrate acquired businesses 
during and  we implemented cost containment efforts and recorded special charges related to corporate restructurings and facilities consolidation 
we continue to focus on maximizing the performance of our business and controlling costs to respond to the economic environment and will continue to evaluate our underlying cost structure to improve our operating results and better position ourselves for growth 
as such  we may incur further facility consolidations or restructuring charges  including severance  benefits and related costs due to a reduction in workforce and or charges for assets disposed of or removed from operations as a direct result of a reduction in workforce 
by the end of  we anticipate that our costs and operating expenses  excluding restructuring related charges  will track to a level that is close to our expected revenue while allowing us to continue to invest in accordance with our strategic priorities 
however  we may be unable to achieve these expense levels without adversely affecting our business and results of operations 
we may continue to experience losses and negative cash flows in the near term  even if sales of our services grow 
while we will continue to implement cost containment efforts across our business  our operating expenses will consume a material amount of our cash resources 
we believe that the total amount of our cash and cash equivalents along with our commercial credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital or other purposes for at least the next twelve months 
thereafter  depending on the development of our business  we will likely require additional funds to support our working capital requirements  unanticipated expenses  opportunities for acquisitions or other business initiatives we encounter and we may seek to raise such additional working capital through public or private equity or debt financing including debt convertible into equity or from other sources 
we may not be able to obtain adequate or favorable financing at that time 
our history of declining market valuation and volatility in our stock price could make it difficult for us to raise capital on favorable terms 
any financing we obtain may dilute or otherwise impair the ownership interest of our current stockholders 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments or equity securities in our short term investment portfolio 
our cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid money market funds  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
as a result  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be significantly affected by a sudden change in market interest rates in our securities portfolio 
we conduct our operations in two primary functional currencies the united states dollar and the british pound 
since our acquisition of od in june  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates have had a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we currently do not hedge our foreign currency exposures and are therefore subject to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
we invoice our international customers primarily in british pounds  except outside of the uk  where we invoice our customers primarily in euros 
we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises from intercompany payables and receivables to and from our foreign subsidiaries and accrued acquisition consideration relating to the od transaction 
for the year ended december   we recognized an  transaction loss on accrued acquisition consideration related to the od transaction 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations and changes in foreign economic conditions did not have a material impact on our financial results in and

we expect to fund these commitments with existing cash and cash flows from operations 
many of the contracts underlying these obligations contain renewal provisions  generally for a period of one year 
in addition  amounts payable under these contracts may vary based on the volume of data transferred 
the amounts in the table represent the base fee amount 
we also have contracts for bandwidth and collocation services that run on a month to month basis and for which there are no unconditional obligations

excluded from the table above are the following we have excluded the million of accrued acquisition consideration recorded at december   net of escrow of approximately million  which is unrecorded  related to our acquisition of od in addition  we have not reflected an additional unrecorded million million based on exchange rates as of december  in contingent consideration related to our acquisition of od which would have been payable upon the achievement of certain performance targets during the period ending november  these obligations have been satisfied as of march as described in acquisition of on demand distribution limited od payments subsequent to december  and march restructuring of future od payment obligations  except that we are required under the terms of the march restructuring to make a remaining cash payment of approximately million approximately million based on december  exchange rates in july deferred revenue of million has been excluded from the table above as the related liabilities will not be settled in cash 
loudeye expects to issue up to  additional shares of its common stock  representing shares to be issued to od option holders issuable upon exercise of od options assumed by loudeye in connection with the od acquisition in june the associated common stock payable of million has been excluded as the related liability will not be settled in cash 
purchase commitments represent obligations under agreements which are not unilaterally cancelable by us  are legally enforceable  and specifically fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices 
we generally require purchase orders for vendor and third party spending 
there were no known contracts or purchase orders exceeding  in the aggregate 
since inception  we have sustained substantial net losses to sustain our growth and establish our business 
for  we will continue to focus on managing costs and increasing revenue 
we expect the following items may represent significant uses of capital resources in the foreseeable future we have certain commitments under existing arrangements with certain licensors of copyrighted materials that may require payments estimated to be approximately million in these 
table of contents amounts are included in accrued and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we may enter into future transactions where we acquire complementary businesses 
such acquisitions may require the use of our capital resources 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for off balance sheet arrangements indemnification obligations 
in the normal course of business  we indemnify other parties  including business partners  lessors and parties to other transactions with us 
we have agreed to hold the other parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representation or covenants  or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made by third parties 
these agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made 
in addition  we have entered into indemnification agreements with certain of our officers and directors and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our officers and directors 
for all agreements entered into after december   the fair value of potential claims has not been recorded in our financial statements because they are not material 
other 
during february  we entered into a twelve month agreement in the ordinary course of business with an internet service provider isp in europe  under which we will provide the isp s customers with promotional credits that may be redeemed for a range of digital media download services through february we will receive a fixed fee of million approximately million based on december  exchange rates under the agreement 
depending upon the actual redemption rate with respect to such promotional credits provided to the isp s customers during the term of the agreement  our cost of revenue associated with this agreement could vary significantly 
at a zero redemption rate  our incremental cost of revenue is nominal and we would generate gross margins approximating the million fee 
conversely  if significantly more credits are redeemed than expected  we could experience negative gross margins from this agreement of up to  approximately  based on december  exchange rates 
our expectation is that actual redemption rate will fall somewhere within that range  and as such  we expect to generate positive gross margin from this agreement 
if the number of credits redeemed during the twelve month term of the agreement does not reach certain minimum levels  the term of the credits may be extended for an additional twelve months 
in addition  we expect to defer revenue under this agreement until the volume of digital downloads is reasonably determinable  which could result in deferral of all revenue under the agreement until february further  as the transaction is denominated in euros  if we do not hedge the arrangement  we could be subject to foreign currency gains or losses 
as of the date of this filing  no losses had been incurred or estimated under this agreement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency exchange risk 
interest rate risk 
we typically invest our excess cash in high quality corporate and municipal debt instruments 
as a result  our related investment portfolio is exposed to the impact of short term changes in interest rates 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carries a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted by a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
as a result  changes in interest rates may cause us to suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value or may cause our future investment income to fall short of expectations 
our investment portfolio is designated as available for sale  and accordingly is presented at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet 

table of contents we protect and preserve our invested funds with investment policies and procedures that limit default  market and reinvestment risk 
we have not utilized derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
during the year ended december   the impact of changes in interest rates on the fair market value of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities caused an insignificant change in our net loss 
based on our invested cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and restricted cash balances of approximately million at december   a one percent change in interest rates would cause a change in interest income of approximately  per year 
due to the investment grade level of our investments  we anticipate no material market risk exposure 
in addition  our term loan is based on the prime rate 
based on the million balance outstanding at december   a one percent increase in the prime rate would increase our interest expense by  per year 
we believe that the impact on the fair market value of our securities and on our operating results for from a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material 
foreign currency exchange risk 
we develop services in the united states and the united kingdom and sell them in north america and throughout europe  and to a much lesser degree  in australia and africa 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
our foreign subsidiaries expenses are incurred in their local currency  principally british pounds or euros 
as exchange rates vary  their expenses  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected results 
as foreign currency exchange rates vary  the fluctuations in revenue and expenses may materially impact the financial statements upon consolidation 
a weaker us dollar would result in an increase to revenue and expenses upon consolidation  and a stronger us dollar would result in a decrease to revenue and expenses upon consolidation 
at december  and from a financial accounting perspective  we were obligated to pay approximately million approximately million based on exchange rates as of december  to former od shareholders  in cash or common stock  at our election 
additionally  we could have been required to pay up to an additional million approximately million based on exchange rates as of december  of contingent acquisition consideration to the former od shareholders if certain performance measurements were met 
based upon the accrued acquisition consideration balance of approximately million at december   if during the first quarter the us dollar uniformly increases or decreases in strength by relative to british pound  we would record a transaction gain or loss of approximately  as part of our restructuring of the remaining payment obligations to the former od shareholders  the amount of the remaining obligations is million approximately million based on exchange rates as of december  after giving effect to our cash payment of approximately million approximately million based on exchange rates as of december  in march and the issuance of  shares of our common stock in march to former od shareholders 
based on the estimated amount we will accrue with respect to our restructured payment obligation of million  if the us dollar uniformly increases or decreases in strength by relative to british pound  we would record a transaction gain or loss of approximately  during  we recorded a net foreign exchange transaction loss of approximately  our operating results were not significantly affected by exchange rate fluctuations in and in addition  the results of operations of od are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of this subsidiary are translated from the local currency to us dollars upon consolidation 
because of the significance of the operations of od to our consolidated operations  as exchange rates vary  net sales and other operating results  when translated  may differ materially from our prior performance and our expectations 
in addition  because of the significance of our overseas operations  we could also be significantly affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce demand for our 
table of contents services and further negatively impact the results of our operations in a material and adverse manner 
as a result of these market risks  the price of our stock could decline significantly and rapidly

we have audited management s assessment  included in the accompanying management s annual report on internal control over financial reporting appearing under item a  that loudeye corp 
and subsidiaries the company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of december   because of the effect of the eight material weaknesses identified in management s assessment  based on criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso 
the company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 
our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states 
those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects 
our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting  evaluating management s assessment  testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control  and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances 
we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 
management s report on internal control over financial reporting as of december   and our audit thereof  excludes consideration of internal control over financial reporting for overpeer  inc and on demand distribution  ltd  two subsidiaries acquired by the company during the year ended december  overpeer  inc and on demand distribution  ltd 
represented of the company s total consolidated assets as of december   and of the company s total consolidated revenue for the year ended december  a company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
a company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that  in reasonable detail  accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company  and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition  use  or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 
because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 
also  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
a material weakness is a control deficiency  or combination of control deficiencies  that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 
the following material weaknesses have been identified and included in management s assessment 

table of contents inadequate personnel in finance and accounting the company has insufficiently skilled personnel and a lack of human resources within the company s finance  accounting  and reporting functions 
the lack of appropriately skilled personnel could result in material misstatements to financial statements not being detected in a timely manner 
inadequate oversight and monitoring of financial processes and financial and accounting personnel the company has insufficient oversight of financially significant processes and systems  including monitoring and oversight of the work performed by the company s finance and accounting personnel 
the processes and systems with insufficient oversight and monitoring include the review and approval  and documentation of the review and approval  of journal entries  periodic reconciliations of subsidiary ledgers  balance sheet and income statement accounts  payroll and employee benefit related processing and reporting  royalty related tracking  reporting  and accounting  invoicing of customers and the processing of customer credits  purchasing of and payment for goods and services received  accrual of expenses  general ledger closing  and the monthly  quarterly  and annual consolidation and financial reporting process 
as a result  the company does not have sufficient internal control over financial reporting to ensure underlying transactions are being appropriately and timely accounted for  which could lead to material misstatements in the financial statements not being detected in a timely manner 
inadequate or ineffectively designed controls the company has an insufficient number of effectively designed controls or ineffectively designed controls to ensure that revenue and royalty transactions are calculated  processed  and accurately reflected in the proper period in the general ledger 
as a result  adjustments in the company s revenue and royalty accounts and financial statements could occur 
inadequate information technology and general computer controls the company does not have adequate information technology and general computer controls over its information systems control environment  including application level design and documentation controls 
as a result  the company is unable to rely upon information technology general controls to perform as expected over time 
the processes with inadequate controls include the integration of internally developed software into financially significant business applications  password management and sharing  and physical access to information technology systems 
in addition  the company has insufficient documentation of their general computer controls and was unable to demonstrate through testing that their information technology dependent controls were operating effectively 
as a result  errors in the company s financial statements that have not been prevented or detected by the company s information technology and general computer controls could occur 
inadequate analysis  documentation  and review of significant non routine transactions the company does not have adequate controls relating to the analysis  documentation  and review of the selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles  to the classification of amortization and impairment charges related to certain intangible assets  business acquisitions  and other non routine transactions  and the preparation of financial statement disclosures relating thereto 
as a result  the company does not have sufficient procedures to ensure significant underlying non routine transactions are appropriately and timely accounted for in the general ledger 
inadequate monitoring of controls for third party service providers the company has inadequate controls over the assessment and monitoring of the effectiveness of controls executed by third party service providers related to the implementation and or maintenance of customer level controls 
as a result  the information and reports from third party service providers received and utilized by the company may contain errors 
inadequate entity level controls the company does not have effective entity level controls with respect to the overall control environment and monitoring 
there are inadequacies in the process for systematic communication of company wide policies and procedures to all employees  including a lack of uniform and consistent communication of the importance of controls 
the pervasive nature of the material weaknesses in the company s internal control over financial reporting in itself constitutes a material weakness 
there are also inadequacies in the company s process to ensure periodic monitoring of internal 
table of contents control activities 
as a result  errors in the company s financial statements that have not been prevented or detected by the company s entity level controls could occur 
inadequate demonstration of control effectiveness through testing the company was unable to demonstrate through testing that the company s internal control over financial reporting was effective for certain processes as required by the coso criteria 
the controls that the company was unable to test included the quarterly and annual general close procedures and financial reporting 
these material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature  timing  and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the financial statements  and this report does not affect our report on financial statements dated march  on those financial statements 
in our opinion  management s assessment that loudeye corp 
did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of december   is fairly stated  in all material respects  based on criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 
also  in our opinion  because of the effects of the material weaknesses described above on the achievement of the control criteria  loudeye corp 
has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december   based on criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission

in june  loudeye acquired on demand distribution limited od  a privately held digital music provider based in europe see note 
in march  loudeye acquired overpeer  inc overpeer  a privately held provider of digital media data mining  anti piracy and promotional solutions based in new york see note 
loudeye segregates its business in two business segments  the digital media services segment and the media restoration services segment 
as discussed in note  loudeye completed the sale of its media restoration services business in may summary of significant accounting policies accounting principles the financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
basis of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of loudeye corp 
and its wholly owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries 
all significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 
loudeye has included the results of operations of acquired entities from the dates of acquisition see note 
estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
examples include estimates of loss contingencies  when technological feasibility is achieved  purchase accounting  music publishing rights and music royalty accruals  the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns  and determining when investment impairments are other than temporary 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management evaluates the potential loss exposure on various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business 
an accrual is made if the amount of a particular claim or lawsuit is probable and reasonably estimable 

table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements continued cash and cash equivalents loudeye considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of demand deposits and money market accounts maintained with financial institutions and certain other investment grade instruments  which at times exceed federally insured limits 
loudeye has not experienced any losses on its cash and cash equivalents 
marketable securities loudeye has classified as available for sale all marketable debt and equity securities for which there is a determinable fair market value and no restrictions on loudeye s ability to sell within the next months 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available for sale securities are included in other income expense 
loudeye has classified securities with a remaining contractual maturity of greater than one year as long term marketable securities 
all securities have a remaining contractual maturity of two years or less 
the cost basis for determining realized gains and losses on available for sale securities is determined on the specific identification method 
the following table summarizes the composition of loudeye s cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale marketable securities at december  and in thousands december  cash and cash equivalents cash money market mutual funds total cash and cash equivalents marketable securities corporate notes bonds commercial paper cds us government agency securities total marketable securities long term marketable securities corporate notes bonds total long term marketable securities total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities the fair value of the available for sale marketable securities by contractual maturity at december  is as follows fair value within one year one to two years total marketable securities the gross unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities at december  and and the gross realized gains or losses on the sale of available for sale securities for the years ended 
table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements continued december   and were immaterial and are therefore not shown 
loudeye has concluded that unrealized losses are temporary due to loudeye s ability to realize its investments at maturity 
restricted cash at december   restricted cash represents approximately million of cash equivalents pledged as collateral against a term loan and approximately  of cash equivalents pledged as collateral in connection with standby letter of credit agreements with certain financial institutions and leasing companies 
accordingly  the restricted cash has been classified as long term in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents loudeye s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in loudeye s existing accounts receivable 
loudeye performs a periodic analysis to determine the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts 
this analysis includes various analytical procedures and a review of factors  including individual review of past due balances over days and greater than a specified amount  loudeye s history of collections  as well as the overall economic environment 
account balances are charged off against the allowance after the potential for recovery is considered remote 
property and equipment property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment write downs 
expenditures that extend the life  increase the capacity  or improve the efficiency of property and equipment are capitalized  while expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred 
depreciation and amortization are calculated on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  ranging from three to five years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset 
goodwill loudeye accounts for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
under fas  goodwill deemed to have indefinite life is not amortized  but is subject to  at a minimum  annual impairment tests 
loudeye assesses the impairment of goodwill on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value is less than its carrying value 
factors loudeye considers important which could trigger an impairment review include the following poor economic performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry  economic or company specific trends  changes in the manner of our use of the assets or the plans for our business  market price of our common stock  or loss of key personnel goodwill represents the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired  primarily from loudeye s recent acquisitions of overpeer and od  which in accordance with fas  is not being amortized 
also in accordance with fas  loudeye tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or as determined necessary 
fas requires a two step goodwill impairment test whereby the first step  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second test is not performed 

table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements continued the second step of the impairment test is performed when required and compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
based on the annual goodwill test for impairment that loudeye performed during the quarter ended december   it was determined that there is no impairment of goodwill 
loudeye performed its annual impairment tests for and and recorded resulting impairment charges 
these charges are discussed in greater detail in note the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended december  and are as follows in thousands years ending december  beginning balance impairment of goodwill from streampipe acquisition impairment of goodwill from vidipax acquisition goodwill from overpeer acquisition goodwill from od acquisition the od and overpeer acquisitions are components of loudeye s digital media services segment 
the streampipe acquisition was a component of loudeye s digital media services segment and the vidipax acquisition was a component of loudeye s media restoration services segment 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
fair value of financial instruments and concentrations of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject loudeye to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  restricted cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable  accrued liabilities and debt and capital lease obligations 
the fair values of these financial instruments approximate their carrying value based on their liquidity or short term nature 
the carrying value of loudeye s long term obligations approximate fair value due to the variable nature of the interest 
loudeye is exposed to credit risk due to its extension of credit to its customers 
loudeye s customer base is dispersed across different geographic areas throughout north america and europe and consists of customers in numerous industries 
loudeye performs initial and ongoing evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally extends credit on open account  requiring collateral as deemed necessary 
one customer accounted for approximately of accounts receivable at december

determining separate elements and allocating value to those elements 
if sufficient evidence of the fair values of the delivered and undelivered elements of an arrangement does not exist  revenue is deferred using revenue recognition principles applicable to the entire arrangement as if it were a single element arrangement under eitf and is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
for arrangements with multiple deliverables which are determined to have separate units of accounting  revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate units in accordance with eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
consideration from multiple element arrangements is allocated among the separate elements based on their relative fair values 
in the event that there is no objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the delivered item  the revenue recognized upon delivery is the total arrangement consideration less the fair value of the undelivered items 
the maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items 
in the limited circumstances where loudeye sells software products  loudeye recognizes revenue associated with the license of software in accordance with sop under the provisions of sop  in software arrangements that involve rights to multiple services  loudeye allocates the total arrangement consideration among each of the deliverables using the residual method  under which revenue is allocated to the undelivered elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of such undelivered elements 
vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately or  in the case of an element not sold separately  the price established by management  if it is probable that the price  once established  will not change before market introduction 
some of loudeye s arrangements may include consulting services sold separately under professional services contracts 
professional services arrangements are billed on a time and materials basis and accordingly  revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
digital media store services revenue 
digital media store services  including music store services  are our newest service offerings and grew significantly following our acquisition of od in june loudeye charges its digital media store customers fixed platform fees  which generally consist of enabling and hosting the service and maintenance of the service s overall functionality during the term of the customer contract 
platform services may include fees related to integration to a customer s website  wireless sites  
table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements continued inventory  account management  and commerce and billing systems 
additionally  platform fees associated with our digital media store services include digital rights management  editorial services  usage reporting  and digital content royalty settlement 
loudeye charges platform fees to its customers in a variety of manners  including initial set up fees  monthly only fees  or a combination of initial set up and monthly fees 
in addition  loudeye provides a number of transactional services  including cover art and metadata publishing  rich media ring tunes for wireless applications delivery  varied commerce and content consumption alternatives for digital media content  including pay as you go  permanent download  or la carte 
loudeye follows the guidance in eitf for purposes of allocating the total consideration to the individual deliverables in its digital media store services arrangements 
loudeye evaluates whether each of the elements in these arrangements represent a separate unit of accounting  as defined by eitf  using all applicable facts and circumstances  including whether i the delivered item s has value to the customer on a standalone basis  ii there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s and iii if there is a general right of return relative to the delivered item s  performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in loudeye s control 
if loudeye determines there are separate units of accounting  loudeye allocates the arrangement consideration to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  as determined by the price of the undelivered items when sold separately 
assuming all other criteria are met ie  evidence of an arrangement exists  collectibility is probable  and fees are fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as follows platform fees are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
revenues from permanent download  or la carte  are recognized at the time the content is delivered  digitally  to the consumer 
revenues from pay as you go are deferred and then recognized as tracks are downloaded by the consumer or as credits expire  whichever occurs earlier 
if evidence of fair value cannot be established for the undelivered elements of an agreement  the revenue from the arrangement is recognized ratably over the period that these elements are delivered or  if appropriate  under the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of direct labor hours incurred to date to total projected labor hours 
encoding services revenue 
encoding services consist of i processing and conversion of digital content into different digital formats pursuant to customers specifications via loudeye s proprietary encoding and transcoding systems and ii the delivery of such processed content to the customer 
the encoded content is either delivered electronically to a file transfer protocol ftp site that our customers access via a previously provided password or loudeye physically ships the content to its customers 
in accordance with sab  loudeye recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the service has been rendered  provided the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is deemed probable 
loudeye evaluates each of these criteria as follows evidence of an arrangement loudeye considers a non cancelable agreement signed by loudeye and the customer to be evidence of an arrangement 
services have been rendered loudeye considers this criteria to be satisfied when the content has been delivered 
fixed or determinable fee loudeye assesses whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenue if all other revenue recognition requirements are met 
loudeye considers these criteria to be satisfied when the payment terms associated with the transaction are within loudeye s normal payment terms 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after the date that fees would customarily be due under loudeye s normal payment terms  loudeye considers the fee to not 
table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements continued be fixed and determinable  and in such cases  loudeye would defer revenue and recognize it when the fees become due and payable 
collection is deemed probable loudeye initially assesses the probability of collection to determine whether this criterion is satisfied based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the current financial condition of the customer 
if loudeye determines that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  loudeye defers revenue until the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon the receipt of cash

additional fees are required to be paid under the contract if the volume of data streamed in a particular month exceeds the specified monthly volume threshold  and the per unit charges for the additional volume approximate the per unit charges for the minimum volumes 
any unused volume of streamed or stored data expires at each month end

the grant date fair value will be determined using option pricing models adjusted for unique characteristics of the equity instruments 
the statement also addresses the accounting for transactions in which a company incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the company s equity instruments or that may be settled through the issuance of such equity instruments 
the statement does not change the accounting for transactions in which a company issues equity instruments for services to non employees or the accounting for employee stock ownership plans 
this statement is effective beginning in the third quarter of  and requires loudeye to recognize compensation costs on outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered

the final settlement terms as approved by the court differ from the initial settlement proposal in that the settlement does not bar the defendant underwriters from bringing contractual indemnity claims against the issuer defendants  including loudeye 
our board of directors approved the proposed settlement in august and is considering whether to approve the final settlement terms in march management does not anticipate that we will be required to pay any amounts under this settlement  however  we can give no assurance that the underwriter defendants will not bring a claim for indemnification against us under the terms of the underwriting agreement relating to our initial public offering

table of contents item changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 
arthur andersen llp on may   the audit committee of our board of directors decided to replace arthur andersen llp  our independent accountants 
arthur andersen llp had served as our independent accountants since arthur andersen llp s reports on our consolidated financial statements for the two years ended december  did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion  nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty  audit scope or accounting principles 
during the two fiscal years ended december  and  and through the date of dismissal  there were no disagreements with arthur andersen llp on any matter of accounting principles or practices  financial statement disclosure  or auditing scope or procedure which  if not resolved to arthur andersen llp s satisfaction  would have caused arthur andersen llp to make reference to the subject matter in connection with its report on our consolidated financial statements for such years  and there were no reportable events as defined in item a v of regulation s k 
on june   based on the recommendation of the audit committee  the board of directors appointed pricewaterhousecoopers llp as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending december  during the two fiscal years ended december  and and through the date of retention  we did not consult with pricewaterhousecoopers llp with respect to the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction  either completed or proposed  or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our consolidated financial statements  or any other matters or reportable events as set forth in items a i and ii of regulation s k 
change in accountants on august   we engaged moss adams llp as our independent registered public accounting firm for our fiscal year ending december  the decision to engage moss adams was approved by our audit committee 
the engagement of moss adams followed our receipt of notice on june  from pwc of its resignation as our independent registered public accounting firm pending completion of services related to the review of our interim financial statements for the quarter ended june  pwc s resignation notice was disclosed on a form k filed july  pwc completed its services on august   and loudeye s relationship with pwc as our independent registered accounting firm ceased on that date 
the reports of pwc on loudeye s financial statements for the years ended december  and did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion  and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty  audit scope or accounting principle  except as follows the report for the year ended december  expressed substantial doubt regarding loudeye s ability to continue as a going concern 
the report for the year ended december  contains the following emphasis of a matter paragraph in june  the company acquired on demand distribution limited od 
the terms of this acquisition require the payment of million approximately million based on exchange rates as of september   including approximately million to be held in escrow and not yet accounted for through november   to od s shareholders  plus additional contingent consideration of up to million approximately million based on exchange rates as of september  if od achieves certain financial performance targets during the period through november  the payments are to be made in british pounds  and accordingly  the company is exposed to risks with changes in the prevailing exchange rate 
any 
table of contents decrease in the value of the us dollar against the british pound will cause a proportional increase in the amount of the future consideration the company must pay to the former od shareholders 
the company may elect to pay amounts due to od s shareholders in shares of the company s common stock 
as a result of the company s acquisition of od  the company will be required to provide additional funding to support od s ongoing operations 
there can be no assurance that the company s cash balances after december  will be sufficient to sustain its operations in and to fund the ongoing operations of od for the period from june   the date pwc was engaged as loudeye s independent registered public accounting firm  through august   there were no disagreements between loudeye and pwc on any matter of accounting principles or practices  financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure  which if not resolved to the satisfaction of pwc  would have caused pwc to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in its report on the financial statements for such year  except as follows in connection with loudeye s common stock and warrant financing completed in august  pwc concluded that the warrants issued in such financing must be recorded as a liability due to the investors rights to receive liquidated damages in the event that a registration statement was not filed and declared effective within specified time periods 
pwc further concluded that until the registration statement was declared effective the warrant liability must be marked to market with a corresponding entry in loudeye s statement of operations 
loudeye initially disagreed with these conclusions  but subsequently agreed to account for the warrants pursuant to pwc s conclusions 
the recommended accounting treatment is reflected in loudeye s financial statements for the quarter ended september   and further explained in note thereto 
in accordance with pwc s conclusion  the warrant liability was reclassified to equity during the fourth quarter of when the registration statement was filed and declared effective timely such that liquidated damages were not triggered 
pwc has been authorized to respond fully to the inquiries of any successor independent registered public accounting firm regarding the initial disagreement 
other than the two material weaknesses discussed below  during the period from june   the date pwc was engaged as loudeye s independent registered public accounting firm  through august   there were no reportable events as defined in item a v of regulation s k 
as disclosed in our quarterly report on form q for the period ended june   our audit committee was advised by pwc in august that during their performance of review procedures related to loudeye s unaudited interim financial statements for the quarter ended june   pwc identified two material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting  as defined in public company accounting oversight board  or pcaob  standard no 
as used by the pcaob  a material weakness is a significant deficiency  or a combination of significant deficiencies  that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 
the material weaknesses identified by pwc were as follows insufficiently skilled personnel compounded by a lack of human resources and expected near term significant turnover within our accounting and financial reporting functions 
also  we must improve controls surrounding adequate monitoring and oversight of the work performed by accounting and financial reporting personnel 
insufficient analysis  documentation and review of the selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles to significant non routine transactions  including the preparation of financial statement disclosures relating thereto 
these material weaknesses resulted in deficiencies in the processes  procedures and competencies within our accounting and financial reporting functions which contributed to post closing adjustments and delays in the completion and filing of our june  form q

controls and procedures 
disclosure controls and procedures our principal executive and principal financial officers  after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule a e and d e under the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this annual report  have concluded that  based on such evaluation  our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of december   described below 
management s annual report on internal control over financial reporting overview internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by  or under the supervision of  our principal executive officer and principal financial officer  and effected by our board of directors  management and other personnel  to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of loudeye s assets  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and that loudeye s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of loudeye s directors and management  and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition  use or disposition of loudeye s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 
internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations 
internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures 
internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override 
because of such limitations  there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting 
however  these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process 
therefore  it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce  though not eliminate  this risk 
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for loudeye 
management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled internal control integrated framework published by the committee of sponsoring organizations coso of the treadway commission to evaluate the effectiveness of loudeye s internal control over financial reporting 
as a result of the material weaknesses described below  management has concluded that the company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of the end of the most recent fiscal year 
moss adams llp has issued an attestation report on management s assessment of loudeye s internal control over financial reporting which appears in this annual report in item financial statements 
for the year ended december   management s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting has been limited to our operations excluding overpeer and od since we are permitted to exclude subsidiaries which we acquired during fiscal year from our internal control assessment at that date pursuant to the guidance from the division of corporation finance and office of the chief accountant of the commission contained in the release captioned frequently asked questions revised october  regarding management s report on internal control over financial reporting and certification of disclosure in exchange act periodic reports

table of contents loudeye s total consolidated assets as of december   and of total consolidated revenue for the year ended december  terms used in discussing internal control over financial reporting there are a number of accounting terms that are used by companies  their independent registered public accounting firms and regulators to describe the effectiveness of a company s internal control over financial reporting 
to facilitate a reader s understanding of our disclosures  we have included definitions of several of the key terms below as defined under standards established by the public company accounting oversight board or pcaob the term material weakness is defined by the pcaob as a significant deficiency  or a combination of significant deficiencies  that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected in a future period 
the pcaob defines a significant deficiency as a control deficiency or combination of control deficiencies that adversely affects our ability to initiate  authorize  record  process  or report external financial data reliably in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles such that there is a more than remote likelihood that a misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected 
summary of actions relating to review and assessment of loudeye s internal control over financial reporting set forth below is a summary of actions that we have taken and that we plan to take with respect to our review and assessment of our internal control over financial reporting 
risk assessment and planning 
in may and june  we performed a risk assessment to guide our overall internal control review process to focus on critical areas 
we continued the risk assessment and planning procedures into as part of our integration of our expanded finance and accounting team 
we anticipate conducting similar risk assessment and planning procedures at our overpeer and od subsidiaries beginning in march with a target completion date of may review and supplementation of existing documentation of internal control over financial reporting 
in june and july  we conducted an initial review of our significant financial accounting processes to identify existing controls and procedures and  together with our outside consultants  in july we began the process of documenting these controls and procedures 
we had not completed documenting all of our controls and procedures at the process  transaction and application level as of december  documentation continued in and we completed documentation of our revised controls and procedures in february for our operations excluding overpeer and od we anticipate beginning the documentation phase at our overpeer and od subsidiaries in march with a target completion date of june review of financially significant general computing controls 
beginning in november  we engaged outside consultants to assist us with our review and risk assessment of internal control over financial reporting relating to our financially significant general computer controls 
through march  we defined several objectives with respect to our review of financially significant general computer controls  including identification of computer control activities  which are the policies and procedures we implement such as approvals  authorizations  verifications  reconciliations and security of assets  
table of contents review  revision and supplementation of control information generated by our computer systems that is used in identifying and capturing data  and developing process documentation  such as policy manuals  accounting memoranda and flowcharts 
we completed our review in march for our operations excluding overpeer and od we began review of financially significant computer controls at our overpeer and od subsidiaries in february  and we have established a target completion date for this review of june remediation of control deficiencies including significant deficiencies and material weaknesses

our remediation efforts with respect to each if the material weaknesses that we have identified are discussed below 
internal test plan development and testing 
we had not developed an internal test plan as of december  during the first quarter we developed an internal test plan and together with our outside consultants performed tests of our internal control over financial reporting as of december  for our operations excluding overpeer and od however  because our remediation efforts of the material weaknesses we identified prior to december  were not complete as of the december  measurement date  management has concluded that it was not able to demonstrate through testing that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december  we anticipate that we will begin our testing of our internal control over financial reporting with respect to fiscal in april we may conclude following our testing that there are further significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
