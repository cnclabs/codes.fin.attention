tds lightbridge historically has provided its tds products and services to wireless carriers in the united states 
the tds business unit also offers services designed to screen  authenticate and approve users engaged in online transactions 
in november  the company announced revised guidance for the fourth quarter of  due to lower revenue expectations from at t wireless services  inc at t  following the acquisition of at t by cingular wireless llc 
as a result of that acquisition  the company does not expect significant revenues from at t in on december   sprint spectrum lp sprint and nextel operations  inc nextel announced that their respective boards of directors had approved a definitive agreement for a merger of the two companies 
lightbridge is unable to predict the effect of the merger of nextel and sprint on its relationship with either customer including  without limitation  the timing or extent of any reductions in applications processed or other services provided under its contracts with those customers 
the loss of another one or more of these major clients  a decrease in orders by one or more of them or a change in the combination of products and services they obtain from the company would adversely affect lightbridge s revenues  margins and net income 
lightbridge has agreements with many of its clients that provide for the purchase of various combinations of tds products and services including cas  risk management and teleservices over periods of one to three years 
although some of these agreements contain annual minimum payment requirements  such minimum payments are typically substantially less than the amount of revenue lightbridge has historically received from the particular client and therefore provide only limited assurance of future sales 
lightbridge s client agreements also often permit changes in the combination of products and services purchased by the client during the term of the agreement 
such changes can affect the revenues  margins and net income that lightbridge achieves from quarter to quarter in its tds business 
lightbridge has agreements for its tds services with at t  sprint and nextel 
the agreements with nextel and sprint were renewed in and extended in each case through december the agreement 
table of contents with at t extends through march  but the company does not expect to receive significant revenues from at t in because of at t s acquisition by cingular wireless  llc  which is not a client of the company 
because lightbridge derives almost all of its tds revenues from telecommunications carriers  the demand for lightbridge s products and services is dependent  in major part  on the overall market demand for the products and services provided by telecommunications carriers 
in particular  lightbridge s tds business is dependent on the rate of new subscriber growth and the rate at which subscribers switch from one carrier to another  known as the churn rate 
accordingly  if the growth rate of the telecommunications industry continues to slow and the churn rate does not increase  sales of lightbridge s tds products and services could continue to decline 
tds revenues may also be affected by mergers or consolidations involving telecommunications carriers  such as the planned merger of sprint and nextel 
ins the company sells its ins system primarily through distribution agreements with ericsson ab ericsson and nortel networks  inc nortel and through direct sales  mainly to international wireless telecommunications carriers 
the agreement with ericsson was amended in and continues in effect until either party gives the other days notice of cancellation 
the agreement with nortel extends through february a significant portion of the company s ins revenues in were generated from the ericsson and nortel relationships 
the loss of one or more of these major distribution partners  a decrease in orders by one or more of them or a change in the combination of products and services they obtain from the company would adversely affect lightbridge s ins revenues  margins and net income 
because lightbridge derives all of its ins revenues from telecommunications carriers  the demand for lightbridge s ins products and services is dependent  in major part  on the overall market demand for the prepaid products and services provided by telecommunications carriers  and may be affected by mergers or consolidations involving telecommunications carriers 
the company s ins sales are also largely dependent on the efforts of ericsson and nortel and its other indirect channel partners to market and sell the ins products  over which the company has no control 
to date  only a small number of wireless telecommunications carriers  almost all of them outside the us  have deployed the company s ins products and services  and the rate of adoption of the ins system will need to increase significantly in order for lightbridge to increase future revenues from ins 
instant conferencing the company presently provides its grouptalk tm product pursuant to an agreement with america online  inc aol to the users of aol s instant messaging service aim under the branded name aim voice conferencing 
the agreement contains certain restrictions on selling the grouptalk product to other instant messaging providers

lightbridge employs a team approach to selling its payment processing services in order to develop a consultative relationship with existing and prospective outside sales partners  merchant banking partners  and isos 
the company s outside sales partner  iso  and banking partner relationships are not exclusive  and the company relies on differentiation  including its support and service  of its payment processing products and services to motivate these outside sales partners and others to promote lightbridge s services over those of another gateway service provider 

table of contents service and technical support for payment processing products are provided to merchants and outside sales partners through a call center  an online help desk  and a dedicated team of account managers that provide services to the company s outside sales partners

engineering  research and development lightbridge believes that its future success in all business segments will depend in part on its ability to continue to enhance  implement  and maintain its existing product and service offerings including  without limitation tds  ins and the payment processing gateway  and to develop  implement and maintain new products and services that allow clients to respond to changing market requirements 
lightbridge s research and development activities consist of long term efforts to develop  enhance and maintain products and services and short term projects to make modifications to respond to immediate client needs 
in addition to internal research and development efforts  lightbridge intends to continue its strategy of gaining access to new technology through strategic relationships and acquisitions where appropriate 
lightbridge also intends to utilize contracted development resources when desirable in order to manage its development costs 
competition the market for the company s payment processing services is characterized by a few large competitors and many smaller competitors 
the market is fragmented  and a number of companies currently offer one or more payment gateway products or services competitive with those offered by lightbridge 
in particular  the company faces competition from its payment processing outside sales partners  which often resell multiple competing gateway products in addition to the authorize 
net products and services 
some of the principal competitors are verisign  inc  cybersource corporation  plug pay technologies  inc and linkpoint international  inc 
the market for products and services to wireless and other communications providers served by the company s tds  ins  and instant conferencing businesses is highly competitive and subject to rapid change 
the market is fragmented  and a number of companies currently offer one or more products or services competitive with those offered by lightbridge 
in addition  many telecommunications carriers are providing  or can provide internally  products and services competitive with those lightbridge offers in these segments 
trends in the telecommunications industry  including greater consolidation and technological or other developments that make it simpler or more cost effective for carriers to provide certain services themselves  could affect demand for lightbridge s tds  ins  and instant conferencing products or services 
these developments could make it more difficult for lightbridge to offer a cost effective alternative to a telecommunications carrier s own capabilities 
lightbridge believes that the principal competitive factors in the communications provider and online industries include the ability to identify and respond to client needs  timeliness  quality and breadth of product and service offerings  price  continuous availability of service  and technical expertise 
lightbridge believes that its ability to compete in these industries also depends in part on a number of factors outside its control  including the ability to hire and retain employees  the development of products and services by others that are competitive with lightbridge s products and services  the price at which others offer comparable products and services  and the extent of its competitors responsiveness to client needs 
government regulation the federal communications commission fcc  under the terms of the communications act of  regulates interstate communications and use of the radio spectrum 
although lightbridge is not required to and does not hold any licenses or other authorizations issued by the fcc for its tds business segment  the domestic telecommunications carriers that constitute lightbridge s tds clients are regulated at both the federal and state levels 
federal and state regulation may decrease the growth of the telecommunications industry  affect the development of the wireless markets  limit the number of potential clients for lightbridge s tds services  impede lightbridge s ability to offer competitive services to the telecommunica 
table of contents tions market  or otherwise have a material adverse effect on lightbridge s tds business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
changing laws and regulations have caused  and are likely to continue to cause  significant changes in the industry  including the entrance of new competitors  consolidation of industry participants  the introduction of bundled wireless and wireline services and the introduction of wireless number portability wnp in november those changes could in turn subject lightbridge to increased pricing pressures  decrease the demand for lightbridge s tds products and services  increase lightbridge s cost of doing business or otherwise have a material adverse effect on lightbridge s tds business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the telecommunications industry outside the united states is also subject to government regulation  which could have similar effects on lightbridge s ability to increase or maintain its penetration of international markets with its ins products and services 
the banking secrecy act  the usa patriot act of  and the homeland security act contain anti money laundering and financial transparency law and mandate the implementation of various new regulations applicable to financial services companies  including obligations to monitor transactions and report suspicious activities 
the obligations under these acts which may apply directly or could be applied to lightbridge s financial services partners or to certain of its merchant services  require the implementation and maintenance of internal practices  procedures  and controls which may increase the company s costs and may subject the company to liability 
businesses that handle consumers funds  such as the company s payment processing business  are subject to numerous regulations  including those related to banking  credit cards  escrow  fair credit reporting  privacy of financial records and others 
state money transmitter regulations and federal anti money laundering and money services business regulations can also apply under some circumstances 
the application of many of these laws with regard to electronic commerce is currently unclear 
in addition  it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be applicable or may be adopted in the future with respect to conducting business over the internet concerning matters such as taxes  pricing  content and distribution 
furthermore  the growth and development of the market for e commerce may prompt more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional regulatory burdens on those companies  such as lightbridge  that provide services to online business 
the adoption of additional laws or regulations may decrease the growth of the internet or other online services  which could  in turn  decrease the demand for the company s products and services and increase the company s cost of doing business 
consumer protection laws in the areas of privacy  credit and financial transactions have been evolving rapidly at the state  federal and international levels 
as the electronic transmission  processing and storage of financial information regarding consumers continues to grow and develop  it is likely that more stringent consumer protection laws may impose additional burdens on companies involved in such transactions 
uncertainty and new laws and regulations  as well as the application of existing laws to e commerce  could limit the company s ability to operate in its markets  expose the company to compliance costs and substantial liability and result in costly and time consuming litigation 
the federal communications commission fcc and state public service commissions may require lightbridge to submit to traditional telecommunications carrier regulations for its grouptalk on demand  voice conferencing service under the communications act of  as amended  and various state laws or regulations as a provider of telecommunications services 
if the fcc or any state public service commission seeks to enforce any of these laws or regulations against the company  lightbridge could be prohibited from providing the voice aspect of its voice conferencing service until it has obtained various federal and state licenses and filed tariffs 
in addition  privacy legislation including the gramm leach bliley act glba and regulations thereunder affect the nature and extent of the products or services the company is able to provide to clients across all segments as well as the company s ability to collect  monitor and disseminate information subject to privacy protection 
consumer legislation such as the fair credit reporting act fcra and equal credit opportunity act ecoa and state laws also affect the nature and extent of the products or services the company is able to provide to clients 

table of contents the securities and exchange commission sec and the national association of securities dealers  inc nasd have also enacted regulations affecting corporate governance  securities disclosure or compliance practices 
the company expects these regulations to increase its compliance costs and to make some of its activities more time consuming 
proprietary rights lightbridge s success across all segments is dependent upon proprietary technology 
lightbridge has traditionally relied on a combination of copyrights  patents  trade secrets and employee and third party non disclosure agreements to establish and protect its rights in its software products and proprietary technology 
lightbridge protects the source code versions of its products as trade secrets and as unpublished copyrighted works  and has internal policies and systems designed to limit access to and require the confidential treatment of its trade secrets 
lightbridge software is provided either on an outsourced basis or under license agreements that grant clients the right to use  but contain various provisions intended to protect lightbridge s ownership and confidentiality of the underlying copyrights and technology 
lightbridge requires its employees and other parties with access to its confidential information to execute agreements prohibiting unauthorized use or disclosure of lightbridge s technology 
in addition  all of lightbridge s employees are required as a condition of employment to enter into confidentiality agreements with lightbridge 
lightbridge also relies on the law of trademarks to establish and protect rights in its products  services and brand names 
lightbridge currently has several issued us and foreign patents and applications pending in the us patent and trademark office and with certain foreign regulatory bodies 
there can be no assurance that any pending patent applications will result in the issuance of any patents  or that lightbridge s current patents or any future patents will provide meaningful protection to lightbridge 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by lightbridge to protect its proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology or independent development by others of similar technology 
it may be possible for unauthorized parties to copy certain portions of lightbridge s products or reverse engineer or obtain and use information that lightbridge regards as proprietary 
existing copyright and trade secret laws and patents issued to lightbridge offer only limited protection 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect lightbridge s proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
lightbridge s competitive position may be affected by limitations on its ability to protect its proprietary information 
however  lightbridge believes that patent  trademark  copyright  trade secret and other legal protections are less significant to lightbridge s success than other factors  such as the knowledge  ability and experience of lightbridge s personnel  new product and service development  frequent product enhancements  customer service and ongoing product support 
certain technologies used in lightbridge s products and services are licensed from third parties 
lightbridge generally pays license fees on these technologies and believes that if the license for any such third party technology were terminated  it would be able to develop such technology internally or license equivalent technology from another vendor  although no assurance can be given that such development or licensing could be effected without significant delay or expense 
although lightbridge believes that its products and technology do not infringe on any existing proprietary rights of others  the company expects to become a party to a pending lawsuit entitled net moneyin  inc v 
verisign  inc  et al  involving intellectual property infringement claims against businesses providing electronic payment gateway services 
the company has also received notices alleging that certain of its products or services may infringe on another party s intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert other infringement claims against lightbridge in the future or that any asserted or future claims will not be successful 
lightbridge could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources with respect to the defense of any claims relating to proprietary rights  which could have a material adverse effect on lightbridge s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
furthermore  parties making such claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages  as well as injunctive or other equitable relief  which could effectively block lightbridge s ability to make  use  
table of contents sell  distribute or market its products and services in the united states or abroad 
such a judgment could have a material adverse effect on lightbridge 
in the event a claim relating to proprietary technology or information is asserted against lightbridge  lightbridge may seek licenses to such intellectual property 
there can be no assurance  however  that such a license could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to lightbridge 
the failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could preclude the sale  manufacture or distribution of lightbridge s products and  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on lightbridge 
employees as of january   lightbridge had a total of employees  of which were full time and were part time or seasonal 
the number of personnel employed by lightbridge varies seasonally 
none of lightbridge s employees are represented by a labor union  and lightbridge believes that its employee relations are good 
the future success of lightbridge will depend in large part upon its continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel 
competition for such personnel can be strong  particularly for sales and marketing personnel  software developers and service consultants

the preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily derived from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual amounts will not differ from those estimates 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because revenue is a key component affecting our operations 
in addition  revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions and bonuses 
certain judgments relating to the elements required for revenue recognition affect the application of our revenue policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue  change in judgments concerning recognition of revenue  change in mix  amount of international sales or delay in recognizing revenue could cause operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we must also make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded when the prospect of collecting a specific account receivable becomes doubtful 
we analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness  current domestic and international economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if our estimates of uncollectibility prove to be inaccurate  additional allowances would be required 
income taxes and deferred taxes 
our income tax policy records the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and the amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we assess the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary valuation allowances as required 
if we were to determine that it was more likely than not that we would be unable to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to operations in the period that such determination was made 
restructuring estimates 
restructuring related liabilities include estimates for  among other things  anticipated disposition of lease obligations 
key variables in determining such estimates include anticipated commencement of sublease rentals  estimates of sublease rental payment amounts and tenant improvement costs and estimates for brokerage and other related costs 
we periodically evaluate and  if necessary  adjust our estimates based on currently available information 

table of contents goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
we recorded goodwill of million and million in connection with the acquisitions of altawave  inc altawave and authorize 
net  respectively and we recorded other intangible assets of million in connection with the acquisition of authorize 
net 
we are required to test such goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis 
we have adopted january st and march st as the dates of the annual impairment tests for altawave and authorize 
net  respectively 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units  and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit 
we will assess the impairment of goodwill on an annual basis or more frequently if other indicators of impairment arise 
overview we develop  market and support a suite of products and services for merchants that sell products and services online and communications providers  including payment processing  customer acquisition and qualification  risk management  prepaid billing  instant teleconferencing  and authentication services 
a majority of our revenues historically have been derived from clients located in the united states 
our revenues are derived from transaction services  consulting and maintenance services  software licensing and hardware 
our transaction service revenues are derived primarily from the processing of applications for qualification of subscribers for telecommunications services  the activation of services for those subscribers and from the processing of payment transactions for merchants 
we have expanded our telecommunications transactions offerings from credit evaluation services to include screening for subscriber fraud  evaluating carriers existing accounts  interfacing with carrier and third party systems and providing call center services 
we also offer transaction services to screen and authenticate the identity of users engaged in online transactions 
our transaction based solutions provide multiple  remote  systems access for workflow management  along with centrally managed client specified business policies  and links to client and third party systems 
transaction services are provided through contracts with carriers and others  which specify the services to be utilized and the markets to be served 
our clients are charged for these services on a per transaction basis 
pricing varies depending primarily on the volume and type of transactions  the number and type of other products and services selected for integration with the services and the term of the contract under which services are provided 
the volume of transactions processed varies depending on seasonal and retail trends  the success of the carriers and others utilizing our services in attracting subscribers and the markets served by our clients 
transaction revenues are recognized in the period in which the services are performed 
transaction services revenues related to payment processing are derived from our credit card processing and echeck processing services  and other services collectively  payment processing services gateway fees and set up fees 
payment processing services revenue is based on a fee per transaction and is recognized in the period in which the transaction occurs 
gateway fees are monthly subscription fees charged to our merchant customers for the use of our payment gateway 
gateway fees are recognized in the period in which the service is provided 
set up fees represent one time charges for initiating our payment processing services 
although these fees are generally paid to us at the commencement of the agreement  they are recognized ratably over the estimated average life of the merchant relationship  which is determined through a series of analyses of active and deactivated merchants 
commissions paid to outside sales partners are recorded in sales and marketing expense in our statements of operations 
we also offer instant voice conferencing transaction services through our grouptalk offering 
no significant revenues have been recognized from our grouptalk offering to date and the instant conferencing business segment is not expected to generate significant revenues in our consulting revenues are derived principally from providing solution development and deployment services and business advisory consulting in the areas of customer acquisition and retention  authentication  
table of contents prepay billing and risk management 
the majority of consulting engagements are performed on a time and materials basis and revenues from these engagements are generally recognized as the services are performed 
when we perform work under a fixed fee arrangement  revenues are generally recognized as services are performed 
revenues from software maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement 
our software licensing revenues consist of revenues attributable to the licensing of our cas application modules and prepay billing software 
the prepay billing system allows carriers to market and manage prepaid wireless services to customers 
prepay is licensed as a packaged software product and each product generally requires incidental customization or integration with other products and systems to varying degrees 
software licensing revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has been made  and a fixed fee and collectibility have been determined 
our hardware revenues historically have been derived in connection with sales of our prepay and phoneprint products 
revenue from hardware is recognized upon shipment  unless testing  integration or other services are required  in which case it is recognized upon commissioning and acceptance of the product 
revenue from hardware sold in conjunction with software is deferred until the software revenue is recognized 
in  we determined that we would no longer actively market or sell our retail management system rms product or our phoneprint product 
in october  we completed the sale of certain assets related to our fraud centurion software product to subex 
as a result of these actions  we do not expect to recognize significant future revenues from these products 
in and  the rate of subscriber growth in the wireless telecommunications industry declined 
we believe  based in part on reports of wireless telecommunications industry analysts  that the rate of subscriber growth will continue to slow in upcoming years 
we also believe we may continue to experience changes in the combination of services acquired by clients and that competitive pricing pressures will continue to negatively affect transaction revenues in we do not expect significant growth in capital spending in the telecommunications industry in in order to add to our business  we are seeking to expand our reach in the e commerce and payment processing business markets and to target industry sectors in the tds business we do not currently serve 
on february   we acquired all of the assets and certain of the liabilities of altawave in exchange for the payment of million in cash  plus up to an additional million contingent on the achievement of certain revenue goals in and no contingent payments were required to be made in connection with the altawave acquisition 
the technology acquired from altawave included solutions to offer wireless carriers a service platform for the development and management of data content and applications mobile data manager 
certain of altawave s technology was used to develop our grouptalk product 
in december  we entered into an agreement to lease approximately  square feet in a single building in burlington  massachusetts for our new principal administrative  sales  consulting  operations marketing and product development facility for our tds business 
the lease was executed and delivered in january in february  we announced the planned expansion of our call center operations to liverpool  nova scotia  canada 
our nova scotia facility became operational in the second quarter of on march   we acquired all of the outstanding stock of authorize 
net from infospace inc  for million in cash and incurred approximately million in acquisition related transaction costs 
authorize 
net is a provider of payment solutions for online customer transactions 
the authorize 
net payment gateway provides credit card and electronic check solutions to companies that process orders for goods and services over the internet 
authorize 
net connects small and medium sized businesses to large credit card processors and banking organizations  allowing those businesses to accept electronic payments 
on january   we closed our call center facility in broomfield  colorado 
the broomfield  colorado call center facility had been supporting our tds operating segment 
the work being performed at the facility was transitioned to our other call center facilities 
in conjunction with the closure  we expect to record a restructuring charge of approximately million in the first quarter of  primarily relating to facility closing costs and employee severance and termination benefits

operating segments as a result of our corporate reorganization efforts during  we changed our previously reported operating segments effective in the fourth quarter of all prior period segment financial information has been restated to conform to the current presentation 
based upon the way financial information is provided to our chief operating decision maker  the chief executive officer  for use in evaluating allocation of resources and assessing performance of the business  we now report our operations in four distinct operating segments payment processing services payment processing  telecom decisioning services tds  intelligent network solutions ins and instant conferencing services instant conferencing 
the payment processing segment offers a transaction processing system  under the authorize 
net brand  that allows businesses to authorize  settle and manage credit card  electronic check and other electronic payment transactions online 
the tds segment provides customer qualification  risk assessment  fraud screening  consulting services and call center services to telecommunications and other companies 
the ins segment provides wireless carriers with a real time rating engine for voice  data and in services for prepaid subscribers as well as postpaid charging functionality and telecom calling card services 
the instant conferencing segment provides managed instant conferencing services through our grouptalk tm product 
in  we made the decision to no longer actively market or sell our grouptalk tm product 
we expect to continue to provide the services for grouptalk under our agreement with aol 
within these four segments  performance is measured based on revenue  gross profit and operating income loss realized from each segment 
there are no transactions between segments 
we do not allocate certain corporate or centralized marketing and general and administrative expenses to our business unit segments  because these activities are managed separately from the business units 
also  we do not allocate restructuring expenses and other non recurring gains or charges to our business unit segments because our chief executive officer evaluates the segment results exclusive of these items 
asset information by operating segment is not reported to or reviewed by our chief executive officer and therefore we have not disclosed asset information for each operating segment 
the historical operating results associated with our rms product  which we no longer actively market or sell  are included in our tds segment 
the historical operating results associated with our phoneprint product  which we no longer actively market or sell  and our fraud centurion products  which we sold to subex in  are included in our ins segment 
the historical operating results associated with our mobile data manager product  which we no longer actively market or sell  are included in our instant conferencing segment

it is possible that sprint or nextel could elect not to renew their agreements  to reduce the volume of products and services they purchase from the company or to request significant changes to the pricing or other terms in any renewal agreement 
additionally  a significant portion of our revenues from our prepay billing system is generated through distribution agreements with ericsson and nortel networks 
a loss of one or more of these major clients  a decrease in orders by one or more of these clients or a change in the combination of products and services they obtain from us would adversely affect our revenues  margins and net income 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues 
revenues and certain revenues comparisons for the years ended december  and were as follows year ended year ended december  december  difference difference dollars in thousands transaction services consulting and maintenance services software licensing and hardware total the increase in transaction services revenues was due primarily to the acquisition of authorize 
net on march   which contributed million of revenue for the period from april  to december  authorize 
net s revenues for the period from april  to december  have increased compared to the same period in  as reported by authorize 
net s former owner  infospace  inc the increased revenues are the result of an increase in the number of merchant customers and increased volume of transactions processed 
the increased revenue related to the acquisition of authorize 
net was partially offset by a decline in transactions services revenues in our tds segment 
the decline in tds transaction services revenues was a result of lower transaction fees charged to certain clients as a result of competitive pricing pressures and an unfavorable change in the mix of services provided despite a increase in the volume of subscriber applications processed during tds transaction services revenues in included approximately million related to a settlement received as a result of the worldcom  inc bankruptcy proceedings  for services provided to worldcom  inc in we did not recognize revenue at the time the services were performed due to concerns regarding the collectibility of our fees 
in the near term  we expect transaction services revenue from authorize 
net to continue to increase 
however  we expect transaction services revenue associated with our tds segment to decline from the level as a result of cingular wireless llc s acquisition of at t and its decision to process all credit applications through cingular s internal system  and continued price pressures 
we do not expect cingular at t wireless to contribute significant revenues in in  million in transaction services revenue was associated with at t 
we expect tds transaction services revenues to continue to reflect the industry s rate of growth of new subscribers as well as the rate of switching among carriers by subscribers subscriber churn 
while we experienced growth in the number of applications processed in as compared to  we believe that transaction revenues in future periods will continue to be impacted by changes in the demand for our transaction offerings  changes in the combination of services purchased by clients  carrier consolidation including the proposed merger of sprint and nextel  and competitive pricing pressures 
the decrease in consulting and maintenance services revenues of million for was principally due to a decline in consulting and maintenance revenues related to our decision to no longer actively market  sell or develop our rms and phoneprint products and the sale of our fraud centurion product 
consulting and maintenance services revenues associated with these products were million lower in than in the preceding year 
additionally  maintenance revenues related to our prepay software product suite declined million in as compared with the prior year as a result of pricing pressures  but an increase in consulting revenues during the same period related to this product partially mitigated this impact 
in our tds segment  pricing pressures on maintenance services and a reduced level of consulting activity also contributed to the revenue decrease 
we expect consulting and maintenance services revenue associated with our prepay software product suite in to continue at a similar level as however  we expect our total consulting and maintenance services revenue in to decrease in comparison with the level  as we do not expect significant future 
table of contents revenues from our rms or fraud centurion products 
these products contributed million in consulting and maintenance services revenues in in addition  we recorded million in consulting and maintenance revenues associated with at t in  and we do not expect significant revenues from this customer in future periods 
the decline in software licensing and hardware revenues of million in as compared to was due to our decision to no longer actively market sell or develop our rms and phoneprint products  which contributed million less in revenue than in the previous year 
in addition  while the total revenues associated with our prepay product remained largely unchanged  revenue associated with new software licenses and subscriber growth license fees increased  and revenue associated with hardware sales decreased 
we expect software licensing and hardware revenues in to be lower than those in  as a result of the discontinued marketing of our rms and phoneprint products and the sale of our fraud centurion product 
in  we recorded software licensing and hardware revenue of million associated with these products 
we expect the level of capital spending by carriers to continue to affect the sales of our prepay product in future quarters 
our prepay software clients growth rates for net new subscribers continue to impact the level of our growth fee license revenue  and hardware revenues are largely a function of the number of prepay software license sales and the number of subscribers each new system sold will support

net s products and services  including personnel costs  communication costs  such as high bandwidth internet access  server equipment depreciation  transactional processing fees  as well as customer care costs 
in the future  cost of revenues may vary as a percentage of total revenues as a result of a number of factors  including changes in the volume of transactions processed  changes in the mix of transaction revenues between those from automated transaction processing and those from processing transactions through our teleservices call centers  changes in pricing to certain clients and changes in the mix of total revenues among transaction services revenues  consulting and maintenance services revenues  and software licensing and hardware revenues

net business were included in our results beginning in the second quarter of because of the acquisition of authorize 
net on march  this change accounted for million of the spending increase in from in our tds business  spending increased in our call centers as a result of the addition of a significant new client in the second half of generally  cost of revenue from automated transaction processing tends to be lower than costs of revenue from processing transactions through our teleservices call centers 
this increase was partially offset by reduced costs of maintaining systems and networks used in processing qualification and activation transactions

net on march  authorize 
net contributed million to the transaction services gross profit amount 
this was partially offset by a decrease in the transaction services gross profit related to our tds segment 
authorize 
net generates a higher gross profit percentage than our tds segment  resulting in increased transaction services gross profit percentage in in comparison to consulting and maintenance services cost of revenues decreased by million in this decrease was attributable to a reduction in headcount associated with the june  january and september restructurings  reduced use of contract labor primarily for consulting related to our rms product  and the sale of our fraud centurion product to subex 
consulting and maintenance services gross profit and gross profit percentage decreased in due to lower revenues related to our rms  fraud centurion and phoneprint products  as well as competitive pricing pressures 
software licensing and hardware cost of revenues decreased slightly by million in in comparison with this decrease was primarily attributable to the mix of software products licensed during as compared to the prior year 
the software licensing and hardware cost of revenue is more reflective of average historical and expected future software licensing and hardware cost of revenues than the cost in software licensing and hardware gross profit decreased in in absolute dollars as a result of lower revenues  but gross profit percentage remained consistent with the gross profit percentage earned can 
table of contents vary significantly based on discounts given on individual transactions and the mix of software and hardware revenues 
we expect that fluctuations in gross profit may occur in future periods primarily because of a change in the mix of revenue generated from our three revenue components  and also because of competitive pricing pressures

engineering and development expenses include software development costs  consisting primarily of personnel and outside technical service costs related to developing new products and services  enhancing existing products and services  and implementing and maintaining new and existing products and services 
the million increase in engineering and development expenses for as compared with was primarily due to the addition of authorize 
net  the expenses from which are included in our results beginning on april  authorize

engineering and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased for as a result of increased revenues 
we expect engineering and development expenses for the quarter ending march  to be slightly higher than in the previous quarter as a result of an increased level of funded development activity associated with our prepay software product

authorize 
net represented million of sales and marketing expenses in the results 
this increase was partially offset by reductions in marketing costs for the other portions of our business as a result of reduced marketing headcount and program spending as compared with we expect that sales and marketing expenses in the first quarter of will remain consistent with the fourth quarter of in future quarters  we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase with growth in authorize

net represented approximately million of general and administrative expenses in in addition  during  we incurred approximately million in separation costs associated with the resignation our former president and chief executive officer in august we also incurred increased general and administrative expense as a result of increased regulatory and compliance requirements 
these increases were offset by a one time benefit in of approximately million related to the release from liability of amounts that had been reserved for potential claims against us related to the worldcom  inc bankruptcy proceedings  by savings associated with the january and september restructuring activity  and by reductions in program spending 
we expect general and administrative expenses in the quarter ending march  to continue to be greater than the corresponding quarter of primarily due to the inclusion of authorize

impairment of intangible assets 
on january   we performed the annual impairment test for the goodwill balance of approximately million related to our acquisition of altawave in we used the discounted cash flow methodology to determine the fair value of the reporting unit related to these intangible assets 
the discounted cash flow methodology is based upon converting expected cash flows to present value 
our assumptions and methodology in determining the fair value of the reporting unit were reviewed by an independent appraiser 
a comparison of the resulting fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill  indicated that the goodwill and remaining other intangible assets of approximately million were fully impaired 
as a result  a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million and an other intangible asset impairment charge of approximately million were recorded in our consolidated statement of operations in purchased in process research and development ipr d 
in connection with the authorize 
net acquisition  we recorded a million charge during the first quarter of for two ipr d projects

the research projects in process at the date of acquisition related to the development of the card present solution cps and the fraud tool ft 
development on the ft project and the cps project was started at the end of and the beginning of  respectively 
the complexity of the cps technology lies in its fast  flexible and redundant characteristics 
the complexity of the ft technology lies in its responsiveness to changing fraud dynamics and efficiency 
the value of the projects was determined by an independent appraiser using the income method 
the discounted cash flow method was utilized to estimate the present value of the expected income that could be generated through revenues from the projects over their estimated useful lives through the percentage of completion for the projects was determined based on the amount of research and development expenses incurred through the date of acquisition as a percentage of estimated total research and development expenses to bring the projects to technological feasibility 
at the acquisition date  we estimated that the cps and the ft projects were approximately and complete  respectively  with fair values of approximately  and  respectively 
the discount rate used for the fair value calculation was for the cps project and for the ft project 
at the date of acquisition  development of the technology involved risks to us including the remaining development effort required to achieve technological feasibility and uncertainty with respect to the market for the technology 
we completed the development of the ft in may having spent approximately  on the project after the acquisition 
total cost to complete the cps project after acquisition is estimated to be approximately  the cps project is expected to be completed by september if the development of the technology is not completed on schedule  the potential consequences to us may include

the liabilities for deferred revenue related to these contracts as of the closing date totaled million 
we recorded a gain of approximately million in the fourth quarter of related to this transaction

equity in loss of partnership investment 
in june  we committed to invest up to million in a limited partnership that invested in businesses within the wireless industry

we recorded deferred tax expense of approximately million in  resulting from a full valuation allowance being recorded against our deferred tax assets 
our effective tax rate was and for and  respectively 
the tax provision reflects current tax expense of approximately million  consisting primarily of foreign tax expenses of million  partially offset by current federal and state tax benefits 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years and our forecast of future taxable income 
in determining future taxable income  we are responsible for assumptions utilized including the amount of state  federal and international pre tax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
after considering all available evidence  both positive and negative  regarding the ability to realize our deferred tax assets  we concluded that an increase to the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets was required 
in november  we announced that we expected our future revenue from at t to decline significantly 
this announcement had a considerable impact on our conclusion regarding the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  based on our best estimate  we recorded a non cash charge of million in to increase the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets 
if circumstances change such that the realization of our deferred tax assets is concluded to be more likely than not  we will record future income tax benefits at the time that such determination is made

risk factors if one or more of our major clients stops using our products or services or changes the combination of products and services it uses  our operating results would suffer significantly 
our revenues are concentrated among a few major clients 
our largest clients accounted for approximately of our total revenues in  and we expect that most of our revenues will continue to come from a relatively small number of clients for the foreseeable future 
consequently  our revenues  margins and net income may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter based on the actions of a single significant client 
a client may take actions that significantly affect us for reasons that we cannot necessarily anticipate or 
table of contents control  such as reasons related to the client s financial condition  changes in the client s business strategy or operations  the introduction of alternative competing products or services  acquisitions  or as the result of the perceived quality or cost effectiveness of our products or services 
our services agreements with sprint spectrum lp sprint  and nextel operations  inc nextel expire on december  our services agreement with at t wireless services  inc at t expires on april   but is subject to earlier termination of the services agreement upon twelve months notice and designated services upon notice 
in february  cingular wireless llc cingular announced an agreement to acquire at t and in october  cingular announced that it had completed its merger with at t 
cingular is not presently a client of lightbridge 
as a result of the acquisition of at t  we do not expect that client to generate significant revenue in on december   sprint and nextel announced that their respective boards of directors had approved a definitive agreement for a merger of the two companies 
we are unable to predict the effect of the merger of nextel and sprint on our relationship with either client including without limitation the timing or extent of any reductions in applications processed or other services provided under our contracts with those clients 
it is possible that sprint and or nextel could elect not to renew their agreements  to reduce the volume of products and services they purchase from us or to request significant changes to the pricing or other terms in any renewal agreement 
the loss of sprint and or nextel or any of our other major clients would cause sales to fall below expectations and materially reduce our revenues  margins and net income and adversely affect our business 
certain of our revenues are uncertain because our clients may reduce the amounts of or change the combination of our products or services they purchase 
most of our communications client contracts extend for terms of between one and three years 
during the terms of these contracts  our communications clients typically may elect to purchase any of several different combinations of products and services 
the revenue that we receive for processing a transaction for such a client may vary significantly depending on the particular products and services used to process the transaction 
in particular  transactions handled through our teleservices group generally result in significantly higher revenue than transactions that are submitted and processed electronically  but also result in higher cost of revenues 
therefore  our revenues or margins from a particular client may decline if the client changes the combination of products and services it purchases from us 
to the extent our client contracts contain minimum purchase or payment requirements  these minimums are typically at levels significantly below actual or historical purchase or payment levels 
therefore  our current clients may not continue to utilize our products or services at levels similar to previous years or at all  and may not generate significant revenues in future periods 
if any of our major clients significantly reduces or changes the combination of products or services it purchases from us for any reason  our business would be seriously damaged 
our revenues are concentrated in the wireless telecommunications industry  which is experiencing declining growth rates  consolidation and increasing pressure to control costs 
we currently derive a majority of our revenues from companies in the wireless telecommunications industry  and we expect that wireless telecommunications companies will continue to account for a majority of our revenues in in recent years  the growth rate of the domestic wireless industry has slowed 
in addition  consolidation has affected the number of carriers to whom our products and services can be marketed and sold  and competition among wireless carriers has continued to increase  resulting in heightened efforts by carriers to control costs 
many of our carrier clients have sought  and may in the future seek  pricing concessions when they renew their services agreements with us or at other times  which could affect our revenues  margins and net income 
in addition  certain of our carrier clients have sought bankruptcy protection in recent years  and we believe it is possible that additional clients may file for bankruptcy protection if current industry conditions continue 
bankruptcy filings by our clients or former clients such as worldcom  inc may prevent us from collecting some or all of the amounts owing to us at the time of filing  may require us to return some or all of any payments received by us within days prior to a bankruptcy filing and may also result in 
table of contents the termination of our service agreements 
as a result of the foregoing conditions  our success depends on a number of factors our ability to maintain our profit margins on sales of products and services to companies in the wireless telecommunications industry  the financial condition of our clients and their continuing ability to pay us for services and products  our ability to develop and market new or enhanced products and services to new and existing clients  continued growth of the domestic wireless telecommunications markets  the number of carriers seeking to implement prepaid billing services  and our ability to increase sales of our products and services internationally 
our future revenues may be uncertain because of reliance on third parties for marketing and distribution 
authorize 
net distributes its service offerings primarily through outside sales partners 
in  authorize 
net s revenues were derived predominantly through relationships with distribution partners 
in addition  the prepay billing system is currently marketed primarily through distribution agreements with ericsson and nortel 
ericsson has been the source of substantially all of our revenue derived from the prepay billing system in recent years 
our agreement with ericsson may be terminated by either party on days notice to the other 
we have also entered into a business alliance with verisign  inc verisign to assist us in penetrating the online transaction market 
we intend to continue to market and distribute our current and future products and services through existing and other relationships both in and outside of the united states 
there are no minimum purchase obligations applicable to any existing distributor or other sales and marketing partners and we do not expect to have any guarantees of continuing orders 
failure by our existing and future distributors or other sales and marketing partners to generate significant revenues or our failure to establish additional distribution or sales and marketing alliances or changes in the industry that render third party distribution networks obsolete could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  distributors and other sales and marketing partners may become our competitors with respect to the products they distribute either by developing a competitive product themselves or by distributing a competitive offering 
for example  resellers of authorize 
net products and services are permitted to and generally do market and sell competing products and services  ericsson or nortel may evaluate and seek to distribute or acquire alternative vendors prepaid products that compete with prepay  and verisign may elect to market or acquire alternative fraud and identity verification products 
competition from existing and future distributors or other sales and marketing partners could significantly harm sales of our products 
we have made and may continue to make acquisitions  which involve risks 
we acquired corsair communications  inc in february of  the assets of altawave  inc in february of and authorize 
net corporation in march of we may also make additional acquisitions in the future if we identify companies  technologies or assets that appear to complement our business 
acquisitions involve risks that could cause the actual results of any acquisitions we make to differ from our expectations 
for example we may experience difficulty in integrating and managing acquired businesses successfully and in realizing anticipated economic  operational and other benefits in a timely manner 
the need to retain existing clients  employees  and sales and distribution channels of an acquired company and to integrate and manage differing corporate cultures can also present significant risks 
if we are unable to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses  we may incur substantial costs and delays or other operational  technical or financial problems 

table of contents our acquisition of authorize 
net significantly reduced our available cash and liquidity 
in other future acquisitions  we may issue equity securities that could be dilutive to our shareholders or we may use our remaining cash  which may have an adverse effect on our liquidity 
we also may incur additional debt and amortization expense related to intangible assets as a result of acquisitions 
this additional debt and amortization expense  as well as the potential impairment of any purchased goodwill  may materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
we may also be required to make continuing investments in acquired products or technologies to bring them to market  which may negatively affect our cash flows and net income 
in addition  we may assume contingent liabilities that may be difficult to estimate 
acquisitions may divert management s attention from our existing business and may damage our relationships with our key clients and employees 
the success of our growth strategy is dependent on our ability to expand into new or complementary markets 
in order to achieve growth in our business  we are seeking to expand our business into new markets or markets that are complementary to our existing business 
if we are not able to expand successfully into new markets  our financial results and future prospects may be harmed 
our ability to enter new markets depends on a number of factors  including growth in our targeted markets  our ability to provide products and services to address the needs of those markets  and competition in those markets 
if we do not continue to enhance our existing products and services  and develop or acquire new ones  we will not be able to compete effectively 
the industries in which we do business or intend to do business have been changing rapidly as a result of increasing competition  technological advances  regulatory changes and evolving industry practices and standards  and we expect these changes will continue 
current and potential clients have also experienced significant changes as the result of consolidation among existing industry participants and economic conditions 
in addition  the business practices and technical requirements of our clients are subject to changes that may require modifications to our products and services 
in order to remain competitive and successfully address the evolving needs of our clients  we must commit a significant portion of our resources to identify and anticipate emerging technological and market trends affecting the markets in which we do business  enhance our current products and services in order to increase their functionality  features and cost effectiveness to clients that are seeking to control costs and to meet regulatory requirements  develop or acquire new products and services that meet emerging client needs  such as products and services for the online market  modify our products and services in response to changing business practices and technical requirements of our clients  as well as to new regulatory requirements  integrate our current and future products with third party products  and create and maintain interfaces to changing client and third party systems 
we must achieve these goals in a timely and cost effective manner and successfully market our new and enhanced products and services to clients 
in the past  we have experienced errors or delays in developing new products and services and in modifying or enhancing existing products and services 
if we are unable to expand or appropriately enhance or modify our products and services quickly and efficiently  our business and operating results will be adversely affected 

table of contents we and our clients must comply with complex and changing laws and regulations 
government regulation influences our activities and the activities of our current and prospective clients  as well as our clients expectations and needs in relation to our products and services 
businesses that handle consumers funds  such as our authorize 
net business  are subject to numerous regulations  including those related to banking  credit cards  electronic transactions and communication  escrow  fair credit reporting  privacy of financial records and others 
state money transmitter regulations and federal anti money laundering and money services business regulations can also apply under some circumstances 
the application of many of these laws with regard to electronic commerce is currently unclear 
in addition  it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be applicable or may be adopted in the future with respect to conducting business over the internet concerning matters such as taxes  pricing  content and distribution 
if applied to us  any of the foregoing rules and regulations could require us to change the way we do business in a way that increases costs or makes our business more complex 
in addition  violation of some statutes may result in severe penalties or restrictions on our ability to engage in e commerce  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our clients also include telecommunications companies that  to the extent that they extend consumer credit  may be subject to federal and state regulations 
in making credit evaluations of consumers  performing fraud screening or user authentication  our clients are subject to requirements of federal law  including the equal credit opportunity act ecoa  the fair credit reporting act fcra and the gramm leach bliley act glba and regulations thereunder  as well as state laws which impose a variety of additional requirements 
privacy legislation may also affect the nature and extent of the products or services that we can provide to clients as well as our ability to collect  monitor and disseminate information subject to privacy protection 
although most of the products and services we provide to the telecommunications industry  other than our profile service  are not directly subject to these requirements  we must take these extensive and evolving requirements into account in order to meet our clients needs 
in some cases  consumer credit laws require our clients to notify consumers of credit decisions made in connection with their applications for telecommunications services  and we have contracted with some of our clients  including sprint  at t  nextel  western wireless corporation and dobson communications  inc  to provide such notices on their behalf 
our software has in the past contained  and could in the future contain  undetected errors affecting compliance by our clients with one or more of these legal requirements 
failure to properly implement these requirements in our products and services in a timely  cost effective and accurate manner could result in liability  either directly or as indemnitor of our clients  damage to our reputation and relationships with clients and a loss of business 
consumer protection laws in the areas of privacy  credit and financial transactions have been evolving rapidly at the state  federal and international levels 
as the electronic transmission  processing and storage of financial information regarding consumers continues to grow and develop  it is likely that more stringent consumer protection laws may impose additional burdens on companies involved in such transactions 
uncertainty and new laws and regulations  as well as the application of existing laws to e commerce  could limit our ability to operate in our markets  expose us to compliance costs and substantial liability and result in costly and time consuming litigation 
furthermore  the growth and development of the market for e commerce may prompt more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional regulatory burdens on those companies  such as lightbridge  that provide services to online business 
the adoption of additional laws or regulations may decrease the growth of the internet or other online services  which could  in turn  decrease the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business 
the securities and exchange commission and the national association of securities dealers  inc have also enacted regulations affecting our corporate governance  securities disclosure and compliance practices 
we expect these regulations to increase our compliance costs and to make some of our activities more time consuming 
if we fail to comply with any of these regulations  we could be subject to legal actions by regulatory authorities or private parties 

table of contents on demand voice conferencing services may become subject to traditional telecommunications carrier regulation by federal and state authorities  which would increase the cost of providing our services  require us to suspend services to existing clients  and may subject us to penalties 
the federal communications commission fcc and state public service commissions may require us to submit to traditional telecommunications carrier regulations for our grouptalk on demand  voice conferencing service under the communications act of  as amended  and various state laws or regulations as provider of telecommunications services 
if the fcc or any state public service commission seeks to enforce any of these laws or regulations against us  we could be prohibited from providing the voice aspect of our voice conferencing service until we have obtained various federal and state licenses and filed tariffs 
we believe we would be able to obtain those licenses  although in some states  doing so could significantly delay our ability to provide services 
we also could be required to comply with other aspects of federal and state laws and regulations 
subjecting our voice conferencing service to these laws and regulations would increase our operating costs  may require us to suspend service to existing clients  could require restructuring of those services to charge separately for the voice and other components  and would involve on going reporting and other compliance obligations 
we also might be subject to fines or forfeitures and civil or criminal penalties for non compliance 
we need to continue to improve or implement our procedures and controls 
requirements adopted by the securities and exchange commission in response to the passage of the sarbanes oxley act of require annual review and evaluation of our internal control systems  and attestation of these systems by our registered independent public accounting firm 
as permitted by the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission  management determined that the internal control over financial reporting of authorize 
net would be excluded from the final internal control assessment 
we need to periodically review our internal control procedures  enhance them as may be necessary and consider the adequacy of the documentation of such procedures 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with all of the new requirements 
any improvements in our internal control systems or in documentation of such internal control systems and the internal control assessment of authorize 
net could be costly to prepare or implement  divert attention of management or finance staff  and may cause our operating expenses to increase over the ensuing year 
changes to credit card association rules or practices could adversely impact our authorize 
net business 
our authorize 
net credit card payment gateway does not directly access the visa and mastercard credit card associations 
as a result  we must rely on banks and their service providers to process our transactions 
we must comply with the operating rules of the credit card associations 
the associations member banks set these rules  and the associations interpret the rules 
some of those member banks compete with authorize 
net 
visa  mastercard  american express or discover could adopt new operating rules or interpretations of existing rules which we might find difficult or even impossible to comply with  resulting in our inability to give customers the option of using credit cards to fund their payments 
if we were unable to provide a gateway for credit card transactions  our authorize 
net business would be materially and adversely affected 
we could be subject to liability as a result of security breaches  service interruptions by cyber terrorists or fraudulent or illegal use of our services 
because some of our activities involve the storage and transmission of confidential personal or proprietary information  such as credit card numbers and social security numbers  and because we are a link in the chain of e commerce  security breaches  service interruptions and fraud schemes could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible monetary damages 
cyber terrorists have periodically interrupted  and may continue to interrupt  our payment gateway services in attempts to extort payments from us or disrupt commerce 
our payment gateway services may be susceptible to credit card and other payment fraud schemes  including unauthorized use of credit cards or bank accounts  identity theft or merchant fraud 

table of contents we expect that technically sophisticated criminals will continue to attempt to circumvent our anti fraud systems 
if such fraud schemes become widespread or otherwise cause merchants to lose confidence in our services in particular  or in internet systems generally  our business could suffer 
in addition  the large volume of payments that we handle for our clients makes us vulnerable to third party or employee fraud or other internal security breaches 
further  we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches and fraud to address any problems they may cause 
our payment system may also be susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses 
these uses may include illegal online gambling  fraudulent sales of goods or services  illicit sales of prescription medications or controlled substances  software and other intellectual property piracy  money laundering  bank fraud  child pornography trafficking  prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages and tobacco products and online securities fraud 
despite measures we have taken to detect and lessen the risk of this kind of conduct  we cannot ensure that these measures will succeed 
in addition  regulations under the usa patriot act of may require us to revise the procedures we use to comply with the various anti money laundering and financial services laws 
our business could suffer if clients use our system for illegal or improper purposes or if the costs of complying with regulatory requirements increase significantly 
we have expended  and may be required to continue to expend  significant capital resources to protect against security breaches  service interruptions and fraud schemes 
our security measures may not prevent security breaches  service interruptions and fraud schemes and the failure to do so may disrupt our business  damage our reputation and expose us to risk of loss or litigation and possible monetary damages 
the demand for our payment processing products and services could be negatively affected by a reduced growth of e commerce or delays in the development of the internet infrastructure 
sales of goods and services over the internet do not currently represent a significant portion of overall sales of goods and services 
we depend on the growing use and acceptance of the internet as an effective medium of commerce by merchants and customers in the united states and as a means to grow our business 
we cannot be certain that acceptance and use of the internet will continue to develop or that a sufficiently broad base of merchants and consumers will adopt  and continue to use  the internet as a medium of commerce 
it is also possible that the number of internet users  or the use of internet resources by existing users  will continue to grow  and may overwhelm the existing internet infrastructure 
delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of internet activity could also have a detrimental effect on the internet and correspondingly on our business 
these factors would adversely affect usage of the internet  and lower demand for our products and services 
our reliance on suppliers and vendors could adversely affect our ability to provide our services and products to our clients on a timely and cost efficient basis 
we rely to a substantial extent on third parties to provide some of our equipment  software  data  systems and services 
in some circumstances  we rely on a single supplier or limited group of suppliers 
for example  our authorize 
net business requires the services of third party payment processors 
if any of these processors cease to allow us to access their processing platforms  our ability to process credit card payments would be severely impacted 
in addition  we depend on our originating depository financial institution odfi partner to process automated clearing house transactions  and our ability to process these transactions would be severely impacted if we were to lose our odfi partner for any reason 
our reliance on outside vendors and service providers also subjects us to other risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components and reduced control over quality  pricing and timing of delivery of components 
for example  in order to provide our credit verification service  we need access to third party credit information databases provided to us by outside vendors 
similarly  delivery of our activation services often requires the availability and performance of billing systems which are also supplied by 
table of contents outside vendors 
if for any reason we were unable to access these databases or billing systems  our ability to process credit verification transactions could be impaired 
in addition  our business is materially dependent on services provided by various telecommunications providers 
a significant interruption in telecommunications services could seriously harm our business 
from time to time  we must also rely upon third parties to develop and introduce components and products to enable us  in turn  to develop new products and product enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis 
in particular  we must rely on the development efforts of third party wireless infrastructure providers in order to allow our prepay product to integrate with both existing and future generations of the infrastructure equipment 
we may not be able to obtain access  in a timely manner  to third party products and development services necessary to enable us to develop and introduce new and enhanced products 
we may not be able to obtain third party products and development services on commercially reasonable terms and we may not be able to replace third party products in the event such products become unavailable  obsolete or incompatible with future versions of our products 
our business may be harmed by errors in our software 
the software that we develop and license to clients  and that we also use in providing our transaction processing and call center services  is extremely complex and contains hundreds of thousands of lines of computer code 
large  complex software systems such as ours are susceptible to errors 
the difficulty of preventing and detecting errors in our software is compounded by the fact that we maintain multiple versions of our systems to meet the differing requirements of our major clients  and must implement frequent modifications to these systems in response to these clients evolving business policies and technical requirements 
our software design  development and testing processes are not always adequate to detect errors in our software prior to its release or commercial use 
as a result  we have from time to time discovered  and may likely in the future discover  errors in software that we have put into commercial use for our clients  including some of our largest clients 
because of the complexity of our systems and the large volume of transactions they process on a daily basis  we sometimes have not detected software errors until after they have affected a significant number of transactions 
software errors can have the effect of causing clients that utilize our products and services to fail to comply with their intended credit or business policies  or to fail to comply with legal requirements  such as those under the ecoa  fcra  or glba 
such errors  particularly if they affect a major client  can harm our business in several ways  including the following we may suffer a loss of revenue if  due to software errors  we are temporarily unable to provide products or services to our clients  we may not be paid for the products or services provided to a client that contain errors  or we may be liable for losses or damages sustained by a client or its subscribers as a result of such errors  we may incur additional unexpected expenses to correct errors in our software  or to fund product development projects that we may undertake to minimize the occurrences of such errors in the future  we may damage our relationships with clients or suffer a loss of reputation within our industry  we may become subject to litigation or regulatory scrutiny  and our clients may terminate or fail to renew their agreements with us or reduce the products and services they purchase from us 
our errors and omissions insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur due to software errors 
it is also possible that such insurance might cease to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

table of contents our initiatives to improve our software design and development processes may not be successful 
the development of our products has  in some cases  extended over a period of more than ten years 
this incremental development process has resulted in systems which are extremely complex 
systems of the size and complexity of ours are inherently difficult to modify and maintain 
we have implemented and are also evaluating changes in our product development  testing and control processes to improve the accuracy and timeliness of modifications that we make to our software  including the frequent modifications that we must make in response to changes in the business policies and technical requirements of our clients 
we believe that our initiatives to implement a new product architecture and to improve our product development  test and control processes will be important to our future competitive position and success 
if we are not successful in carrying out these initiatives on a timely basis or in a manner that is acceptable to our clients  our business and future prospects could be harmed 
our success is dependent in part on prepay  which may not achieve market penetration 
our future operating results will depend to a significant extent on the demand for and market penetration of prepay  our prepaid metered billing system 
to date  only a small number of wireless carriers  almost all of them outside the us  have deployed prepay  and the rate of adoption of the prepay system will need to increase significantly in order to achieve our revenue targets 
prepay has been sold predominantly by ericsson 
ericsson  from time to time  may evaluate and seek to distribute or acquire alternative vendors prepaid product offerings 
any change in the terms of our distribution arrangements with ericsson or ericsson s desire to discontinue our relationship would drastically affect sales of prepay 
although our own sales force also sells prepay  it has not yet generated significant prepay sales 
we cannot ensure that sales of the prepay system will increase or that prepay will gain market penetration 
if prepay does not gain market penetration our future operating results would be adversely affected 
if we are unable to make successful acquisitions  our future growth will be limited 
a key element of our strategy is to acquire businesses  technologies or products that expand and complement our business 
we believe acquisitions are necessary for us to grow at a desirable rate  and we will continue to evaluate possible acquisition opportunities in the future 
even if we are able to identify suitable companies or businesses to buy  we may not be able to purchase any of these companies at favorable prices  or at all  for any number of reasons 
if we are unable to make acquisitions  we may not be able grow our business 
we may not be able to successfully manage operational changes 
over the last several years  our operations have experienced rapid growth in some areas and significant restructurings and cutbacks in others 
these changes have created significant demands on our executive  operational  development and financial personnel and other resources 
if we achieve future growth in our business  or if we are forced to make additional restructurings  we may further strain our management  financial and other resources 
our future operating results will depend on the ability of our officers and key employees to manage changing business conditions and to continue to improve our operational and financial controls and reporting systems 
we cannot ensure that we will be able to successfully manage the future changes in our business 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate 
our operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
if our operating results fall below the expectations of investors or public market analysts  the price of our common stock could fall dramatically 
our common stock price could also fall dramatically if investors or public market analysts reduce their estimates of our future quarterly operating results  whether as a result of information we disclose  or based on industry  market or economic trends  or other factors 

table of contents our revenues are difficult to forecast for a number of reasons seasonal and retail trends affect our transaction revenues  in both our payment processing and tds businesses  as well as our other products and services 
transaction revenues historically have represented the majority of our total revenues 
as a result  our revenues can fluctuate 
for example  our revenues generally have been highest in the fourth quarter of each calendar year  particularly in the holiday shopping season between thanksgiving and christmas 
in addition  marketing initiatives undertaken by our clients or their competitors may significantly affect the number of transactions we process 
the sales process for our products and services offered to telecommunications clients is lengthy  sometimes exceeding twenty four months 
the length of the sales process makes our revenues difficult to predict 
the delay of one or more large orders  particularly orders for software  which typically result in a substantial amount of non recurring revenue  could cause our quarterly revenues to fall substantially below expectations 
we ship our software products within a short period after receipt of an order  and we usually do not have a material backlog of unfilled orders of software products 
consequently  our revenues from software licenses in any quarter depend substantially on the orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
as a result  a delay in the consummation of a license agreement may cause our revenues to fall below expectations for that quarter 
our consulting services revenues can fluctuate based on the timing of product sales and projects we perform for our clients 
many of our consulting engagements are of a limited duration  so it can be difficult for us to forecast consulting services revenues or staffing requirements accurately more than a few months in advance 
most of our expenses  particularly employee compensation  are relatively fixed 
as a result  even relatively small variations in the timing of our revenues may cause significant variations in our quarterly operating results and may result in quarterly losses 
our quarterly results may also vary due to the timing and extent of restructuring and other changes that may occur in a given quarter 
as a result of these factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful 
you should not rely on our quarterly results of operations to predict our future performance 
our foreign sales and operations subject us to risks and concerns which could negatively affect our business overall 
we expect our international revenues will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues 
we also intend to further expand our sales efforts internationally 
in addition to the risks generally associated with sales and operations in the us  sales to clients outside the us and operations in foreign countries present us with many additional risks  including the following the imposition of financial and operational controls and regulatory restrictions by foreign governments  the need to comply with a wide variety of complex us and foreign import and export laws and treaties  political and economic instability that may lead to reduced demand for our products and services  changes in tariffs  taxes and other barriers that may reduce our ability to sell our solutions or may reduce the profitability of those solutions  longer payment cycles and increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates  which may reduce our earnings if we denominate arrangements with international clients in the currency of the country in which our products or services 
table of contents are provided  or with respect to arrangements with international clients that are us dollar denominated  which may make our systems less price competitive  changes in technology standards  such as interfaces between products  that are developed by foreign groups and may require additional development efforts on our part or change the buying behavior of some of our clients  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  difficulties in managing a global network of distributors or representatives and in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations  costs and risks of localizing systems in foreign countries  additional complications and expenses related to supporting products internationally  and the possibility that our purchase agreements may be governed by foreign laws that differ significantly from us laws  which may limit our ability to enforce our rights under these agreements 
we face significant competition for a limited supply of qualified software engineers  consultants and sales and marketing personnel 
our business depends on the services of skilled software engineers who can develop  maintain and enhance our products  consultants who can undertake complex client projects and sales and marketing personnel 
in general  only highly qualified  highly educated personnel have the training and skills necessary to perform these tasks successfully 
in order to maintain the competitiveness of our products and services and to meet client requirements  we need to attract  motivate and retain a significant number of software engineers  consultants and sales and marketing personnel 
qualified personnel such as these are in short supply and we face significant competition for these employees  from not only our competitors but also clients and other enterprises 
other employers may offer software engineers  consultants and sales and marketing personnel significantly greater compensation and benefits or more attractive career paths than we are able to offer 
any failure on our part to hire  train and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel would seriously damage our business 
changes in management could affect our ability to operate our business 
our future success will depend to a significant degree on the skills  experience and efforts of our executive officers 
we have experienced recent changes in management including the resignation of pamela da reeve  our former president and ceo  on august  the loss of any of our executive officers could impair our ability to successfully manage our current business or implement our planned business objectives and our future operations may be adversely affected 
we face competition from a broad and increasing range of vendors 
the market for products and services offered to communications providers and participants in online transactions is highly competitive and subject to rapid change 
each of these markets is fragmented  and a number of companies currently offer one or more products or services competitive with ours 
we anticipate continued growth and the formation of new alliances in each of the markets in which we compete  which will result in the entrance of new competitors in the future 
we face potential competition from several primary sources providers of online payment processing services  including verisign  cybersource corporation  plug pay technologies  inc and linkpoint international  inc software vendors that provide one or more customer acquisition  customer relationship management and retention or risk management solutions  including ectel ltd  tsi telecommunications services inc tsi  fair isaac corporation  magnum software systems  inc  american management systems  incorporated and slp infoware  
table of contents telecommunications equipment vendors that market software based solutions to complement their hardware offerings  such as hewlett packard company and ericsson  service providers that offer customer acquisition  customer relationship management and retention  risk management or authentication services in connection with other services  including choicepoint inc  visa usa  experian information solutions  inc  equifax  inc  lexis nexis  trans union  llc  schlumberger sema plc and amdocs ltd  information technology departments within larger carriers that have the ability to provide products and services that are competitive with those we offer  information technology vendors that offer wireless and internet software applications such as oracle corporation  microsoft corporation and international business machine corporation  consulting firms or systems integrators that may offer competitive services or the ability to develop customized solutions for customer acquisition and qualification  customer relationship management and retention or risk management  such as american management systems  incorporated  accenture ltd  bearingpoint  inc  peoplesoft  inc  siebel systems  inc and cap gemini ernst young  software vendors of prepaid wireless billing products  including boston communications group  inc  intervoice  inc  comverse technology  inc  glenayre technologies  inc  verisign telecommunications services  telemac cellular corporation  fair  isaac co 
inc  orga kartensysteme gmbh  schlumberger sema plc  alcatel usa  priority call management  lucent technologies  inc  hewlett packard company tandem division  telcordia technologies  inc and sixbell  a number of alternative technologies  including profilers  personal identification numbers and authentication  provided by companies such as verizon communications  inc  authentix network inc 
and fair isaac corporation  vendors that provide products and services in the wireless data market  such as bridgewater systems corporation  oraclemobile  a division of oracle corporation  thpass  inc  tsi  seven networks  inc 
and openwave systems inc  and vendors that provide or resell products and services in the voice conferencing market such as spectel  inc  polycom inc  raindance communications  inc  ptek holdings  inc  and the major worldwide telecommunications providers such as at t  sprint  and global crossing limited 
because competitors can easily penetrate one or more of our markets  we anticipate additional competition from other established and new companies 
in addition  competition may intensify as competitors establish cooperative relationships among themselves or alliances with others 
many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  marketing  technical and other competitive resources than we do 
as a result  these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in client requirements  or may be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services 
in addition  in order to meet client requirements  we must often work cooperatively with companies that are  in other circumstances  competitors 
the need for us to work cooperatively with such companies may limit our ability to compete aggressively with those companies in other circumstances 
a failure of  error in or damage to our computer and telecommunications systems would impair our ability to conduct transactions  payment processing and support services and harm our business operations 
we provide tds and payment processing transaction services  as well as support services  using complex computer and telecommunications systems 
our business could be significantly harmed if these systems fail or suffer damage from fire  natural disaster  terrorism including cyber terrorism  power loss  telecommunications failure  unauthorized access by hackers  electronic break ins  intrusions or attempts to deny our ability to deploy our services  computer viruses or similar events 
in addition  the growth of our client base  a significant 
table of contents increase in transaction volume or an expansion of our facilities may strain the capacity of our computers and telecommunications systems and lead to degradations in performance or system failure 
many of our agreements with telecommunications carriers contain level of service commitments  which we might be unable to fulfill in the event of a natural disaster  an actual or threatened terrorist attack or a major system failure 
errors in our computer and telecommunications systems may adversely impact our ability to provide the products and services contracted for by our clients 
we may need to expend significant capital or other resources to protect against or repair damage to our systems that occur as a result of malicious activities  cyber terrorism  natural disasters or human error  but these protections and repairs may not be completely effective 
our property and business interruption insurance and errors and omissions insurance might not be adequate to compensate us for any losses that may occur as the result of these types of damage 
it is also possible that such insurance might cease to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents for  or otherwise protect  our proprietary technologies 
we rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws  license and confidentiality agreements  and software security measures to protect our proprietary rights 
much of our know how and other proprietary technology is not covered by patent or similar protection  and in many cases cannot be so protected 
if we cannot obtain patent or other protection for our proprietary software and other proprietary intellectual property rights  other companies could more easily enter our markets and compete successfully against us 
we have a limited number of patents in the us and abroad  and have pending applications for additional patents  but we cannot be certain that any additional patents will be issued on those applications  that any of our current or future patents will protect our business or technology against competitors that develop similar technology or products or services or provide us with a competitive advantage  or that others will not claim rights in our patents or our proprietary technologies 
patents issued and patent applications filed relating to products used in the wireless telecommunications and payment processing industry are numerous and it may be the case that current and potential competitors and other third parties have filed or will file applications for  or have received or will receive  patents or obtain additional proprietary rights relating to products used or proposed to be used by us 
we may not be aware of all patents or patent applications that may materially affect our ability to make  use or sell any current or future products or services 
the laws of some countries in which our products are licensed do not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws 
we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees and clients and restrict access to  and distribution of  our proprietary information 
nevertheless  we may be unable to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information or detect unauthorized use of and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
our competitors also may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
we may become a party to intellectual property infringement claims  which could harm our business 
we are aware of  and we expect we may become a party to  a pending lawsuit captioned net moneyin  inc v 
verisign  inc  et al  case no 
civ tuc rcc  which lawsuit was brought by a company that claims to hold patents related to such services 
the case was brought in the united states district court for the district of arizona  against a variety of defendants  including payment processing gateway providers and banks  which are accused of infringing certain patents involving payment processing over computer networks 
the plaintiff alleges that numerous products or services infringe its patents  including the authorize 
net payment gateway service and echeck 
net service 
neither lightbridge nor authorize 
net is a party to the suit  but authorize 
net is indemnifying and defending defendants infospace  inc and e commerce exchange  inc 
as to services provided by authorize 
net 
defendant wells fargo bank  na has also requested indemnification  including defense costs  from authorize 
net based on certain contracts with 
table of contents authorize 
net 
lightbridge anticipates that plaintiff may attempt to add authorize 
net and or lightbridge as a party defendant 
the litigation is currently in the fact discovery phase  and no trial date has been set 
from time to time  we have had and may be forced to respond to or prosecute other intellectual property infringement claims to protect our rights or defend a client s rights 
these claims  regardless of merit  may consume valuable management time  result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays  all of which could seriously harm our business and operating results 
furthermore  parties making such claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to make  use  sell or otherwise practice our intellectual property  whether or not patented or described in pending patent applications  or to further develop or commercialize our products in the us and abroad and could result in the award of substantial damages against us 
we may be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with third parties claiming infringement by us of their intellectual property in order to settle these claims 
these royalty or licensing agreements  if available  may not have terms that are acceptable to us 
in addition  if we are forced to enter into a license agreement with terms that are unfavorable to us  our operating results would be materially harmed 
we may also be required to indemnify our clients for losses they may incur under indemnification agreements if we are found to have violated the intellectual property rights of others 
our business could require additional financing 
our future business activities  including our operation of authorize 
net  the development or acquisition of new or enhanced products and services  the acquisition of additional computer and network equipment  the costs of compliance with government regulations and the international expansion of our business will require us to make significant capital expenditures 
if our available cash resources prove to be insufficient  because of unanticipated expenses  revenue shortfalls or otherwise  we may need to seek additional financing or curtail our expansion activities 
if we obtain equity financing for any reason  our existing stockholders may experience dilution in their investments 
if we obtain debt financing  our business could become subject to restrictions that affect our operations or increase the level of risk in our business 
it is also possible that  if we need additional financing  we will not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms  or at all
