item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations at december   our operations consisted of wholly owned casino resorts and investments in two other casino resorts  including las vegas  nevada bellagio  mgm grand las vegas  the mirage  ti  new york new york  boardwalk  and monte carlo owned 
other the primm valley resorts buffalo bill s  primm valley resort and whiskey pete s in primm  nevada  beau rivage in biloxi  mississippi  mgm grand detroit  borgata owned in atlantic city  new jersey 
we operate in one segment  the operation of casino resorts  which includes offering gaming  hotel  dining  entertainment  retail and other resort amenities 
slightly over half of our net revenues are derived from gaming activities  a lower percentage than many of our competitors  as our operating philosophy is to provide a complete resort experience for our guests  including non gaming amenities which command premium prices based on their quality 
we generate a majority of our net revenues and operating income from our las vegas strip resorts 
in  over of our net revenues and operating income was generated by wholly owned las vegas strip resorts 
we believe that we own the premier casino resorts on the las vegas strip  and a main focus of our strategy is to continually reinvest in these resorts to maintain that competitive advantage 
our concentration on the las vegas strip exposes us to certain risks outside of our control  such as competition from other las vegas strip resorts as well as new or expanded resorts in las vegas  including wynn las vegas expected to open in  and the impact from potential expansion of gaming in california 
this concentration also exposes us to risks related to tourism and the general economy  including national and global economic conditions and terrorist attacks or other global events 
key performance indicators as a resort based company  our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts  which in turn impacts the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities 
we also generate a significant portion of our operating income from the high end gaming segment  which can cause variability in our results 
key performance indicators related to revenue are gaming revenue indicators table games drop and slot handle volume indicators  win or hold percentage  which is not fully controllable by us 
our normal table games win percentage is in the range of to of table games drop and our normal slot win percentage is in the range of to of slot handle  hotel revenue indicators hotel occupancy volume indicator  average daily rate adr  price indicator  revenue per available room revpar  a summary measure of hotel results  combining adr and occupancy rate 
most of our revenue is essentially cash based  through customers wagering with cash or paying for non gaming services with cash or credit cards 
our resorts  like many in the industry  generate significant operating cash flow 
our industry is capital intensive and we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financing  fund maintenance capital expenditures and provide excess cash for future development 
our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature  though a variety of factors can affect the results of any interim period  including the timing of major las vegas conventions  the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our high end customers  and the level of play during major holidays  including new year and chinese new year 

table of contents overall outlook we have invested heavily in our existing operations in and  and expect to continue to do so on a targeted basis in our las vegas strip resorts require ongoing capital investment to maintain their competitive advantages 
we believe the investments in additional non gaming amenities we made in and have enhanced our ability to generate increased visitor volume and allowed us to charge premium prices for our amenities 
the most likely significant factors affecting operating results at our existing resorts in will be the expected continued strength of the leisure and convention travel segments  the expansion of bellagio and the opening of k and other amenities at mgm grand las vegas  and new competition from wynn las vegas on the las vegas strip 
various lodging market observers  such as pricewaterhousecoopers and smith travel research  are forecasting mid single digit percentage growth in revpar in  with greater revpar gains in full service hotels 
our revpar growth  and revpar growth in las vegas in general  has outpaced that of the national market  and we expect that trend to continue 
the bellagio expansion opened in late and added over to the resort s room base 
in addition  we added new meeting  retail and dining space and significantly expanded the spa and salon 
k opened in late november at mgm grand las vegas  which had been without a featured production show for almost two years 
along with the numerous restaurant and other entertainment additions at mgm grand las vegas  k will enhance our ability to generate visitor traffic and capture a greater share of our guests spending 
wynn las vegas will add room capacity to the las vegas market  with its  rooms representing a increase in las vegas room supply 
wynn las vegas will also feature numerous upscale restaurants and generally target customers who might otherwise choose bellagio  mgm grand las vegas or the mirage 
we believe there will be some impact on these resorts from wynn las vegas  but also believe that the breadth of amenities in our portfolio of resorts and our loyalty and other marketing programs will help minimize these competitive pressures 
the proximity of wynn las vegas to ti and the mirage  along with pedestrian bridges linking ti with the fashion show mall and venetian  will also benefit these resorts 
mandalay merger on june   we announced that we had entered into a definitive merger agreement with mandalay resort group mandalay  a publicly traded company  under which we will acquire mandalay for in cash for each share of common stock of mandalay 
mandalay owns and operates eleven properties in nevada  including mandalay bay  luxor  excalibur  circus circus  and slots a fun in las vegas  circus circus reno in reno  colorado belle and edgewater in laughlin  gold strike and nevada landing in jean  and railroad pass in henderson 
mandalay also owns and operates gold strike  a hotel casino in tunica county  mississippi 
in addition  mandalay owns a interest in silver legacy in reno  a interest in monte carlo in las vegas  a interest in grand victoria  a riverboat in elgin  illinois  and a interest in motorcity in detroit  michigan 
the total consideration is approximately billion  including equity value of approximately billion  convertible debentures with a redemption value of approximately million  the assumption or repayment of other outstanding mandalay debt with a fair value of approximately billion as of december   and million of estimated transaction costs 
the transaction is structured as a merger of one of our wholly owned subsidiaries with and into mandalay 
the transaction will be accounted for as a purchase and is anticipated to close during the first quarter of the mandalay merger will impact our operations in several ways 
we will have to integrate mandalay s operations into ours 
this could require additional operating and capital expenditures 
however  we expect to achieve ongoing cost savings and revenue enhancements from this process 
we expect to realize efficiencies in operations and economies of scale in purchasing  as well as more effectively market to a broader base of customers 
our operating cash flow will increase substantially  as will our interest and tax charges 

table of contents summary financial results the following table summarizes our results of operations year ended december  percentage percentage change change in thousands  except per share data net revenues operating income income from continuing operations diluted income from continuing operations per share income from continuing operations increased in due to our strong top line growth and the fact that revenue growth was driven largely by increased prices of our rooms and strong casino revenue 
operating margins correspondingly increased to in from in and in results on a per share basis were positively impacted by a lower weighted average number of shares outstanding as the result of share repurchases throughout and operating results the following table includes key information about our operating results year ended december  percentage percentage change change in thousands net revenues operating expenses casino and hotel operations general and administrative corporate expense preopening  restructuring and property transactions  net depreciation and amortization income from unconsolidated affiliates operating income on a consolidated basis  the most important factors and trends contributing to our operating performance over the last three years have been the war with iraq and the outbreak of sars in asia  both of which negatively impacted leisure travel and our high end gaming business in late and early  the new labor contract covering our las vegas strip employees since mid  which calls for significant annual wage and benefits increases through  the current economic recovery in the united states  which began to impact our operations in the latter half of and continued to positively affect our results in the ongoing capital investments in upscale amenities at our resorts  which we believe is allowing us to market more effectively to visitors  capture a greater share of these visitors increased travel budgets  and generate premium pricing for our resorts rooms and other amenities 
as a result of the above trends  our net revenues increased in  while increasing only in net revenues at mgm grand las vegas increased in  due to the addition of several new restaurants  bars and other amenities  and in spite of fewer rooms in service due to room remodel activity 
net revenues at new york new york increased as the resort continues to benefit from zumanity and nine fine irishmen  both of which opened in summer net revenues at the mirage decreased as the resort was without the siegfried roy show and the buffet was closed for a portion of the year while cravings was constructed 

table of contents our operating income in increased  due primarily to the strong revenue trends and a full year of borgata s results 
the increase in income from unconsolidated affiliates is responsible for approximately one third of the increase in operating income  while improvements at our operating resorts  particularly bellagio  mgm grand las vegas and new york new york  make up the rest of the increase 
operating income at mgm grand detroit was essentially flat year over year  despite an increase in the gaming tax rate from to effective september several other factors largely offset higher corporate expense due to increased development costs  lower bad debt expense due to improved collections  lower preopening expenses due to borgata preopening expenses in  and higher property transactions  net due to a million gain on sale of land in in  our operating income decreased by 
while revenues grew especially in the second half of  expense growth  particularly in payroll  outpaced revenues

total table games volume for the year was up  with particular strength in baccarat volume  up 
these are the most significant increases in table games volumes since table games revenues decreased in  as a slightly lower hold percentage and the impact of the iraq war and sars outbreak in early were not fully offset by strong volume levels over the latter half of table games win percentages were within our normal range for all periods presented 
slot revenues increased substantially in both and improvements were the result of strong customer visitation  enhanced marketing programs  the impact of our players club rewards program  and the implementation of cashless gaming technology in slot win percentages were consistent among all three periods 
non casino revenue increased in primarily due to the enhanced amenities at our resorts 
in addition  we were able to increase the pricing for our rooms and other non gaming amenities 
our hotel results began to improve notably in the latter half of  particularly at our las vegas strip resorts 
for the year ended december  revpar at our las vegas strip resorts was compared to in  an increase of

in  our primary restructuring activities included closing two marketing offices and terminating the related leases  terminating a lease agreement with a restaurant tenant at mgm grand las vegas  and closing the siegfried roy show  which resulted in a charge for employee severance costs 
in december  we recorded a restructuring credit of million related to a lease contract termination accrual originally recorded in june as we determined that payment under this obligation was not probable 
we recorded million of restructuring charges in december related to contract termination costs for a restaurant lease and the efx show at mgm grand las vegas 
in  management responded to a decline in business volumes caused by the september attacks by implementing cost containment strategies which included a significant reduction in payroll and a refocusing of several of our marketing programs 
this resulted in a million charge against earnings 
as a result of improving business levels and our success at re hiring a substantial number of previously laid off or terminated employees  management determined in that a portion of the remaining accrual was no longer necessary 
this resulted in a restructuring credit of million in property transactions  net consisted of the following year ended december  in thousands gain on sale of north las vegas land siegfried roy theatre write down the mirage storm damage beau rivage write off of detroit development costs impairment of assets to be disposed of demolition costs other net losses on asset sales or disposals 
table of contents in  there were no material unusual property transactions 
in  we sold acres of land in north las vegas  nevada near shadow creek for approximately million  resulting in the million gain reflected above 
prior to  we classified gains and losses on routine assets sales or disposals as a non operating item at some resorts and as an operating item at other resorts 
we believe the preferable presentation of these items is as an element of operating income 
prior period statements have not been reclassified as such transactions were not material in periods prior to until  demolition costs were typically capitalized as part of new construction 
we began expensing demolition costs on major construction projects as incurred on january   and are accounting for this change in policy prospectively 
demolition costs were not material in periods prior to demolition costs in and related primarily to preparation for the bellagio standard room remodel  bellagio expansion and new theatre at mgm grand las vegas 
impairments of assets to be disposed of in consisted primarily of assets related to the former efx show and restaurants closed during at mgm grand las vegas 
in  tropical storm isidore caused property damage at beau rivage totaling million  including clean up costs 
the amount of the write down for damaged assets was determined based on the net book value of the assets and engineering estimates 
in connection with the revised development agreement in detroit  we wrote off million  which was the net book value of previously incurred development costs associated with the riverfront permanent casino site million  offset by previously accrued obligations no longer required under the revised development agreement million

capitalized interest increased in due to the ongoing bellagio expansion and k theatre projects 
capitalized interest in will include interest capitalized on project citycenter 
capitalized interest decreased in due to the suspension of development in atlantic city in late and the mid cessation of interest capitalization on the company s investment in borgata  which opened on july  non operating items from unconsolidated affiliates  primarily our share of borgata s interest expense and state income taxes  increased from million in to million in the increase is due to the full year of borgata s results  offset by a reduction to state income taxes in the fourth quarter of borgata received a notice of refund of certain state tax credits and recorded a benefit for amounts earned in and  which had previously been fully reserved 
our share of the adjustment was million 
we expect our share of the benefit of these tax credits to positively impact this line item by approximately million per year for the next three years 
the following table summarizes information related to our income taxes year ended december  in thousands income from continuing operations before income tax income tax provision effective income tax rate cash paid for income taxes 
table of contents the effective income tax rate in was higher than in primarily due to the accrual of additional state deferred taxes related to capital investments in new jersey  non deductible costs related to a michigan ballot initiative  overseas development costs for which no tax benefit was provided  and the reversal of a greater amount of tax reserves in compared to million in versus million in as a result of completion of audits and the expiration of statutes of limitations 
the effective income tax rate in was lower than in primarily due to the reversal of tax reserves in excluding the reversal  our effective income tax rate was approximately the same in both periods 
in  taxes paid increased from prior years  primarily due to increased book income and the full utilization of tax credit carryforwards in except for  when we made payments to settle irs audits of prior years  taxes paid have generally been significantly lower than our income tax provision 
this is primarily due to accelerated tax depreciation and the utilization of tax credit carryforwards 
we utilized the last of these credits in  which resulted in the increase in our cash paid for taxes in we are evaluating the impact of provisions of the american jobs creation act of the act that provide for a special one time tax deduction of percent on certain repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
additional guidance from congress and or the united states treasury department will be necessary for us to complete our evaluation  as it is not clear at this time whether the act will provide a benefit to us 
we will complete our evaluation as soon as practicable following the issuance of guidance and adjust our taxes accordingly  if necessary 
we have not yet repatriated the net proceeds from the sale of mgm grand australia pending our evaluation 
nonetheless  we provided in deferred us income taxes of million on the basis that such proceeds would be repatriated without the benefit of the percent one time deduction 
such amount was included in the provision for income taxes on discontinued operations for we considered the earnings of our australia operations permanently reinvested prior to the sale of such operations 
if guidance is issued that indicates our planned repatriation qualifies for the one time deduction  we will recognize a tax benefit of approximately million as part of continuing operations in the quarter in which such guidance is issued 
if no such guidance is issued within the applicable timeframe  then we will attempt to permanently reinvest the proceeds in another foreign jurisdiction  such as macau 
in such case  we would recognize a tax benefit of million as part of continuing operations in the quarter in which the reinvestment is made 
we currently do not have a plan to reinvest the proceeds in such manner

off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of investments in unconsolidated affiliates  which currently consist primarily of our investments in monte carlo and borgata 
we have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities  nor have we engaged in any derivative transactions other than straightforward interest rate swaps 
our joint venture and unconsolidated affiliate investments allow us to realize the benefits of owning a full scale resort in a manner that minimizes our initial investment 
we provided a guaranty for up to of the interest and principal payment obligations on the construction financing for the residences at mgm grand 
otherwise  we have not guaranteed financing obtained by our investees  nor are there any other provisions of the venture agreements which are unusual or subject us to risks to which we would not be subjected if we had full ownership of the resort

other significant investing uses of cash flow in include uncommitted capital expenditures  expected to be approximately million exclusive of any spending on a permanent casino in detroit  investments in our macau joint venture or capital spending at mandalay resorts 

table of contents we plan to fund our contractual obligations and other estimated spending through a combination of operating cash flow  proceeds from known or expected sales of businesses and available borrowings under our senior credit facility 
to fund the mandalay acquisition  we entered into the revised bank credit facility  which will provide the required funds to fund payments to mandalay s shareholders and holders of mandalay s convertible debentures  as well as refinance certain of mandalay s outstanding borrowings 
we are required to sell our interest in one of the two casinos in detroit  michigan

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements

senior management and the audit committee of the board of directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates  and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates 
allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at bellagio  mgm grand las vegas and the mirage 
our other facilities do not emphasize marker play to the same extent  although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well 
we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely 
these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts  including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices  personal contacts  the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation 
markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the united states 
at december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the united states 
markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries  but the united states assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states 
a significant portion of our casino accounts receivable is owed by casino customers from the far east

we maintain an allowance  or reserve  for doubtful casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts 
the provision for doubtful accounts  an operating expense  increases the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we regularly evaluate the allowance for doubtful casino accounts 
at resorts where marker play is not significant  the allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances 
at resorts where marker play is significant  we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectibility of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount  based on the age of the account  the customer s financial condition  collection history and any other known information 
we also monitor regional and global economic conditions and forecasts to determine if reserve levels are adequate 
the collectibility of unpaid markers is affected by a number of factors  including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers home countries 
because individual customer account balances can be significant  the allowance and the provision can change significantly between periods  as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a region s economy occur 
the following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables at december  in thousands casino accounts receivable allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable allowance as a percentage of casino accounts receivable median age of casino accounts receivable days days days percentage of casino accounts outstanding over days 
table of contents the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable has decreased since  the result of improved collections leading to improved credit statistics  reflected in the lower median age of accounts and decreasing percentage of accounts outstanding over days 
our reserve percentage is now consistent with the percentage before the september attacks  and is representative of a more normalized collection experience and positive global economic conditions relative to the conditions in and at december   a basis point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change net income by million  or per share 
fixed asset capitalization and depreciation policies property and equipment are stated at cost 
maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred 
depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we account for construction projects in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects 
when we construct assets  we capitalize direct costs of the project  including fees paid to architects and contractors  property taxes  and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiary  mgm mirage design group 
we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures 
whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment 
when constructing or purchasing assets  we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired  which also may be a matter of judgment 
our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets estimated useful lives 
we determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets  engineering studies  and our estimate of the usage of the asset 
whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset  we account for the change prospectively 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 capitalization of interest cost sfas  interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project 
interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weighted average cost of our outstanding borrowings  since we typically do not borrow funds directly related to a development project 
capitalization of interest starts when construction activities  as defined in sfas  begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period 
whether we capitalize interest on a project depends in part on management s actions 
in october  we announced the suspension of development activities on our wholly owned project on the renaissance pointe land in atlantic city 
in connection with that announcement  we stopped capitalizing interest associated with the project 
interest capitalized on this project for the year ended december  was million 
in november  we announced the development of project citycenter in las vegas 
in connection with this announcement and the start of design activities  we began capitalizing interest associated with this project  including capitalizing interest on land costs for the portion of the project citycenter site not currently being utilized in operations 
interest capitalized on this project for the year ended december  was million 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our property and equipment and other long lived assets for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
for assets to be disposed of  we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal  as estimated based on comparable asset sales  solicited offers  or a discounted cash flow model 
for assets to be held and used  we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
we then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset  on an undiscounted basis  to the carrying value of the asset 
if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value  no impairment is indicated 
if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value  then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset  typically measured using a discounted cash flow model 
if an asset is still under development  future cash flows include remaining construction costs 
all recognized impairment losses  whether for assets to be disposed of or assets to be held and used  are recorded as operating expenses 

table of contents there are several estimates  assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of long lived assets 
first  management must determine the usage of the asset 
to the extent management decides that an asset will be sold  it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized 
assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist 
this means that some assets must be grouped  and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets 
future cash flow estimates are  by their nature  subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
on a quarterly basis  we review our major long lived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment 
we estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets 
when appropriate  we discount future cash flows using our weighted average cost of capital  developed using a standard capital asset pricing model 
whenever an impairment loss is recorded  or a test for impairment is made  we discuss the facts and circumstances with the audit committee 
see results of operations for discussion of write downs and impairments recorded in  and in october  we announced the suspension of our development activities on our wholly owned project on the renaissance pointe land in atlantic city 
in connection therewith  we reviewed the land for potential impairment  and determined no impairment was indicated 
in december  in connection with our agreement with turnberry associates whereby we are required to contribute land to the venture  we reviewed the land for potential impairment  and determined no impairment was indicated 
in june  we entered into an agreement to sell the golden nugget subsidiaries 
the fair value less costs to sell exceeds the carrying value  therefore no impairment was indicated 
in february  we entered into an agreement to sell mgm grand australia 
the fair value less costs to sell exceeds the carrying value  therefore no impairment was indicated 
other than the above items  we are not aware of events or circumstances that would cause us to review any material long lived assets for impairment 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states  and in several states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
we account for income taxes according to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
sfas requires the recognition of deferred tax assets  net of applicable reserves  related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences 
the standard requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not 
otherwise  a valuation allowance is applied 
at december   we had million of deferred tax assets and billion of deferred tax liabilities 
except for certain new jersey state net operating losses and certain other new jersey state deferred tax assets  we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets are fully realizable because of the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and future projected taxable income 
the valuation allowance at december  related to the new jersey deferred tax assets was million 
our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities 
while positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws  we do not take such positions unless we have substantial authority to do so under the internal revenue code and applicable regulations 
we may take positions on our tax returns based on substantial authority that are not ultimately accepted by the irs 
we assess such potential unfavorable outcomes based on the criteria of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas 
we establish a tax reserve if an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the unfavorable outcome can be reasonably estimated 
we assess the potential outcomes of tax uncertainties on a quarterly basis 
in determining whether the probable criterion of sfas is met  we presume that the taxing authority will focus on the exposure and we assess the probable outcome of a particular issue based upon the relevant legal and technical merits 
we also apply our judgment regarding the potential actions by the tax authorities and resolution through the settlement process 
we maintain required tax reserves until such time as the underlying issue is resolved 
when actual results differ from reserve estimates  we adjust the income tax provision and our tax reserves in the period resolved 
for tax years that are examined by taxing authorities  we adjust tax reserves in the year the tax examinations are settled 
for tax years that are not examined by taxing authorities  we adjust tax reserves in the year that the statute of limitations expires 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental  and we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable and foreseeable outcomes related to uncertain tax matters 

table of contents in december  we settled the irs audit of the company s and tax returns  which did not result in a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
during  we filed amended returns for tax years subsequent to to reflect the impact of the irs audits of the through tax years on those subsequent years 
in the fourth quarter of  the statutes of limitations expired for the through tax years  resulting in a reduction of our tax reserves of million and a corresponding reduction in our provision for income taxes 
in the third quarter of  the statute of limitations expired for our tax return  resulting in a reduction of our tax reserves of million and a corresponding reduction in our provision for income taxes 
subsequent to december   we received notice that the irs will audit our and tax returns  and the tax returns for years after are subject to possible future examination 
we classify reserves for tax uncertainties within other accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  separate from any related income tax payable or deferred income taxes 
reserve amounts may relate to the deductibility of an item  as well as potential interest associated with those items 
a portion of our tax reserves was assumed in the mirage acquisition 
the irs audit of the tax returns of mirage through the merger date was settled in august  resulting in a payment to the irs of million  including interest 
these matters had been previously reserved for  so the settlement had no impact on our income tax provision or our results of operations 
any future adjustments to the acquired mirage tax reserves will be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill 
accounting principles adopted in taxation on foreign earnings in december  the staff of the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp 
fsp allows us additional time beyond the financial reporting period in which the act was enacted to evaluate the effects of the act on our plans for repatriation of unremitted earnings 
under sfas  we did not historically record a provision for us federal or state income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because such earnings were considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of foreign subsidiaries 
upon the sale of mgm grand australia  we did provide deferred taxes of million on the basis that the proceeds would be repatriated without the benefit of the percent one time deduction provided by the act 
the act may allow a special one time deduction of percent of certain repatriated foreign earnings  however  additional clarifying language is necessary to ensure we qualify for the deduction 
the potential benefit to us of the repatriation provisions of the act is million 
discontinued operations in november  the emerging issues task force eitf of the fasb reached a consensus on issue no 
 applying the conditions in paragraph of fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  in determining whether to report discontinued operations  eitf 
eitf requires us to analyze whether the cash flows of a disposed component have been eliminated from our ongoing operations and whether we retain a continuing involvement in the operations of the disposed component 
if significant migration of customers occurs to our other operations  we would be precluded from classifying a sold or disposed operation as a discontinued operation 
eitf is effective for components disposed of or classified as held for sale in periods beginning after december   with optional application to components disposed of or classified as held for sale within that fiscal year 
we did not apply eitf to our sale of mgm grand australia  but if we had applied eitf we still would have classified mgm grand australia as a discontinued operations 
recently issued accounting standards stock based compensation in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
under the original standard  sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  companies had the option of recording stock options issued to employees at fair value or intrinsic value  which generally leads to no expense being recorded 
most companies  including us  opted to use this intrinsic value method and make required disclosures of fair value expense 
sfas r eliminates this intrinsic value alternative 
sfas r is effective for us on july   at which time all future share based payments must be recorded at fair value 
transition methods are discussed below 
we must make certain changes in the manner of valuation of options and must make certain decisions which will affect the amount and timing of expense recognition  as discussed below 

table of contents choice of valuation model 
under sfas  stock options were generally valued using the black scholes model 
sfas r does not specify which model must be used  but requires that certain assumptions be included in the chosen model 
essentially  we have a choice of continuing to apply the black scholes model or applying a binomial lattice model 
the key difference is that a binomial model can better account for sub optimal exercises  that is  exercises before the contractual expiration of the option 
a binominal model is more complex to apply  and generally results in a lower value than a comparable valuation using the black scholes model 
we have not yet determined which model we will apply 
choice of vesting patterns 
under sfas r  awards with graded vesting  as all of our awards have  may be expensed in one of two time patterns on a straight line basis over the complete vesting period as though the entire award was one grant  or on an accelerated basis  treating each vesting layer as a separate grant and amortizing each layer on a straight line basis 
for disclosure purposes under sfas  we used the accelerated basis 
we have preliminarily concluded that we will use the straight line method for future grants under sfas r 
as discussed below under transition methods  such policy will only apply to future grants 
expense recognized under sfas r for previously granted options will be recorded on the accelerated basis 
estimating forfeitures 
under sfas  we could choose whether to estimate forfeitures at the grant date or recognize actual forfeitures as they occur 
under sfas r  we must estimate forfeitures as of the grant date 
presentation of excess tax benefits in the statement of cash flows 
under sfas r  the excess of tax benefits realized from the exercise of employee stock options over the tax benefit associated with the financial reporting expense is shown as a financing cash inflow in the statement of cash flows 
previously  these excess benefits were shown as an operating cash inflow 
transition alternatives 
there are two allowable transition alternatives the modified prospective transition or the modified retrospective transition 
under the modified prospective transition  we would begin applying the valuation and other criteria to stock options granted beginning july  we would begin recognizing expense for the unvested portion of previously issued grants at the same time  based on the valuation and attribution methods originally used to calculate the disclosures 
under the modified retrospective transition  we would restate prior periods to reflect the previously calculated amounts in the pro forma disclosures as actual expenses of the prior period with no change in valuation or attribution methods 
future accounting would be the same as under the modified prospective transition 
we would also restate the statement of cash flows for the change in classification of excess tax benefits 
in addition  we would be required under the modified retrospective transition method to estimate forfeitures for options outstanding as of july  and recognize a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle to reverse such previously recognized compensation 
we have not yet determined which transition method we will apply 
disclosures 
there are additional disclosure requirements under sfas r  which will not have a material impact on us 
the impact of adopting sfas r on our operating results will depend in part on the amount of stock options or other share based payments we grant in the future 
the following table shows compensation expense related to options granted through december   based on the options vesting schedules in thousands actual  included in our pro forma disclosures actual  included in our pro forma disclosures actual  included in our pro forma disclosures  through june estimated  for pro forma disclosures  july through december estimated  to be recorded as expense we do not believe the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our cash flows or financial position 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our long term debt 
we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long term fixed rate borrowings and short term borrowings under our bank credit facilities 
in  we entered into three interest rate swap agreements  designated as fair value hedges  which effectively converted million of our fixed rate debt to floating rate debt 
in  we terminated interest rate swap agreements with total notional amounts of million and entered into additional interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges with total notional amounts of million  leaving interest rate swap agreements with total notional amounts of million at december  
table of contents under the terms of these agreements  we make payments based on specified spreads over six month libor  and receive payments equal to the interest payments due on the fixed rate debt 
the interest rate swap agreements qualify for the shortcut method allowed under sfas no 
 which allows an assumption of no ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship 
as such  there is no income statement impact from changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments 
the following table provides information about our interest rate swaps as of december  maturity date february  notional value million estimated fair value average pay rate average receive rate interest rates are determined in arrears 
these rates have been estimated based on implied forward rates in the yield curve 
as of december   after giving effect to the interest rate swaps discussed above  long term fixed rate borrowings represented approximately of our total borrowings 
assuming a basis point change in libor  our annual interest cost would change by approximately million
