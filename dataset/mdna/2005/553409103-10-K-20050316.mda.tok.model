item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mps group  inc the company is a leading provider of business services with over offices throughout the united states  canada  the united kingdom  and continental europe 
we deliver specialty staffing  consulting and business solutions to virtually all industries in the following disciplines  through the following primary brands discipline brand s information technology it services modis accounting and finance badenoch clark  accounting principals engineering entegee legal special counsel it solutions idea integration health care soliant health human capital automation beeline historically  we have presented the financial results of our operations under three reporting segments professional services  it services  and it solutions 
in an effort to better align the reporting of our financial results with the manner in which we currently manage our business  we revised the presentation of our financial results from three to four reporting segments in the fourth quarter of our four reporting segments are north american professional services  european professional services  north american it services and european it services 
prior periods have been reclassified to conform to this presentation 
non gaap financial measures from time to time we may measure certain financial information on a constant currency basis 
such constant currency financial data is not a us generally accepted accounting principles gaap financial measure 
constant currency removes from financial data the impact of changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries  by translating the current period financial data into us dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that were used to translate the financial data for the previous period 
we believe presenting certain results on a constant currency basis is useful to investors because it allows a more meaningful comparison of the performance of our foreign operations from period to period 
additionally  certain internal reporting and compensation targets are based on constant currency financial data for our various foreign subsidiaries 
however  constant currency measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures that reflect current period exchange rates  or to other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
from to  we acquired ten businesses for our north american professional services segment together  the acquisitions four legal staffing businesses acquired in february of  august of  august of  and october of  three health care staffing businesses acquired in june of  february of  and march of  and three accounting staffing businesses acquired in february of  july of  and october from time to time we may measure certain financial information excluding the effect of acquisitions 
such financial data that excludes the effect of businesses we acquire is not a gaap financial measure 
we believe presenting some results excluding the effects of businesses we acquire is helpful to investors because it permits a comparison of the performance of our core internal operations from period to period 
additionally  certain internal reporting and compensation targets are based on the performance of core internal operations 
the effect of a business we acquire is excluded for the first months following the acquisition date 
subsequent to this  a business is considered to be integrated for reporting purposes 
again however  such measures should be considered only in conjunction with the correlative measures that include the results from acquisitions  as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
additionally  from time to time we may use ebitda to measure results of operations 
ebitda is a non gaap financial measure that is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we 
table of contents believe ebitda is a meaningful measure of operating performance as it gives management a consistent measurement tool for evaluating the operating activities of the business as a whole  as well as  the various operating units  before the effect of investing activities  interest and taxes 
in addition  we believe ebitda provides useful information to investors  analysts  lenders  and other interested parties because it excludes transactions that management considers unrelated to core business operations  thereby helping interested parties to more meaningfully evaluate  trend and analyze the operating performance of our business 
we also use ebitda for certain internal reporting purposes  and certain compensation targets may be based on ebitda 
finally  certain covenants in our debt facility are based on ebitda performance measures 
ebitda  as with all non gaap financial measures  should be considered only in conjunction with the comparable measures  as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap  including net income 
discontinued operations in december  we sold certain operating assets and transferred certain operating liabilities of our outplacement unit 
as a result of the sale of this unit and in accordance with gaap  the consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations report the results of operations of our outplacement unit as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
revenue generated by this unit was million and million  in and  respectively 
income loss before taxes was million and million  for and  respectively 
we recorded contract termination costs of  in  and  as a result of the sale  an additional  in additional information on contract termination costs can be found in exit costs below 
additional information on discontinued operations can be found in footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
associated with this  we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies in that they are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
revenue recognition we recognize substantially all revenue at the time services are provided  and on a time and materials basis 
in most cases  the consultant is our employee and all costs of employing the worker are our responsibility and are included in cost of revenue 
revenues is generated when we permanently place an individual with a client are recorded at the time of start 
in addition and to a lesser extent  we are involved in fixed price or lump sum engagements 
the services we render under the relevant contracts generally require performance spanning more than one accounting period 
we recognize revenue for these engagements under the proportional performance accounting model 
allowance for doubtful accounts we regularly monitor and assess our risk of not collecting amounts we are owed by our customers 
this evaluation is based upon a variety of factors including an analysis of amounts current and past due along with relevant history and facts particular to the customer 
based upon the results of this analysis  we record an allowance for uncollectible accounts for this risk 
this analysis requires us to make significant estimates  and changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based on income before taxes as reported in the consolidated statements of operations 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets 
table of contents and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
an assessment is made as to whether or not a valuation allowance is required to offset deferred tax assets 
this assessment includes anticipating future income 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
management evaluates all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
the establishment and amount of a valuation allowance requires significant estimates and judgment and can materially affect our results of operations 
our effective tax rate may vary from period to period based  for example  on changes in estimated taxable income or loss  changes to the valuation allowance  changes to federal  state or foreign tax laws  completion of federal  state or foreign audits  deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction  and as a result of acquisitions 
we have a net deferred tax asset as of december  and  primarily due to the impairment loss recorded as a change in accounting principle associated with our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
in this impairment reduced the financial statement carrying amount of goodwill  which resulted in the tax basis of tax deductible goodwill being greater than the financial statement carrying amount 
our tax basis in tax deductible goodwill will be deducted in our income tax returns  generating million of future tax deductions over the next years 
we are subject to periodic review by federal  state  foreign and local taxing authorities in the ordinary course of business 
in  we recorded an million charge for an agreed upon adjustment related to an audit of our prior years tax returns 
additional information on income taxes can be found in footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
stock option plans we have historically issued stock options to employees and directors as an integral part of our compensation programs 
us gaap allows alternative methods of accounting for these plans 
we have chosen to account for our stock option plans under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
under apb  the intrinsic value of the options is used to record compensation expense and  as a result  no compensation expense related to stock options is included in determining net income and net income per share in the consolidated financial statements 
restricted stock grants are accounted for in accordance with apb  which mandates that restricted stock grants with performance conditions be calculated using the intrinsic value 
as required by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas  calculations of pro forma net income loss and net income loss per share  computed in accordance with the method prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  are set forth in footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
we expect to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payments sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
and supercedes apb opinion no 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values  beginning with the first interim or annual period after june  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption alternatives 
under the retroactive alternatives  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with 
table of contents the first period restated 
we are evaluating the requirements of sfas r and have not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas r  nor have we determined whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas impairment of tangible and intangible assets for acquisitions  we allocate the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net tangible assets first to identifiable intangible assets  if any  and then to goodwill 
in connection with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to perform  at least annually  goodwill impairment reviews utilizing a fair value approach 
additionally  sfas no 
required a transitional goodwill impairment review upon adoption 
we adopted sfas no 
as of january  after performing the required transitional goodwill impairment tests  we recognized a loss of million  net of an income tax benefit of million  and recorded the loss net of the related tax benefit as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in the consolidated statement of operations for we performed additional valuation testing during the fourth quarter of  and our designated timing of the annual impairment test under sfas no 
and did not incur any further impairment 
we plan to perform our next annual impairment review during the fourth quarter of an impairment review prior to our next scheduled annual review may be required if certain events occur  including lower than forecasted earnings levels for various reporting units 
in addition  changes to other assumptions could significantly impact our estimate of the fair value of our reporting units 
such a change may result in a goodwill impairment charge  which could have a significant impact on the reportable segments that include the related reporting units and the consolidated financial statements 
as part of our goodwill impairment reviews  fair value was calculated using an equally blended value of a discounted cash flow analysis and market comparables 
in contrast to sfas  the prior accounting standard sfas no 
required the use of undiscounted cash flow estimates over the remaining useful life of the goodwill and other long lived assets as a step test for possible impairment 
under sfas no 
 the concept of recoverability of the goodwill over the useful life of the asset was the underlying test for impairment as opposed to fair value under sfas no 
this fundamental difference in the underlying methodologies of testing for impairment of goodwill in sfas no 
and sfas no 
caused us to attribute the resulting impairment from the initial valuation completed on january  to a change in accounting principle upon the adoption of sfas no 
projected cash flows  used for both sfas no 
and no 
testing  considered the effects from the then downturn in our business 
as mentioned above  we used an equally blended value of a discounted cash flow analysis and market comparables to arrive at fair value for sfas no 
for the discounted cash flow analysis  significant assumptions included expected future revenue growth rates  reporting unit profit margins  working capital levels and a discount rate 
the revenue growth rates and reporting unit profit margins are based  in part  on our expectation of an improving economic environment 
market comparables included a comparison of the market ratios and performance fundamentals from comparable companies 
the use of these measurement criteria is consistent with the underlying concepts used in determining the fair value of a company or reportable unit under the market approach 
the market ratios we used refer to the multiples of revenue and earnings of comparable companies and the performance fundamentals refer to the consideration of the effects of the differences in the operating metrics  ie growth rates  operating margins  gross margins  etc 
on our value versus the comparable companies 
additional information on goodwill can be found in footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
we amortize the cost of identifiable intangible assets either through acquisition or as part of intellectual property over their estimated useful lives unless such lives are deemed indefinite 
we review our long lived assets and identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
in performing the review for recoverability  we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the 
table of contents expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 
otherwise  an impairment loss is not recognized 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets and identifiable intangibles would be based on the fair value of the asset 
exit costs in and  we experienced a material decrease in demand for our domestic operations 
to reflect this decreased demand  we made attempts to realign our real estate capacity needs and thus vacate and reorganize certain office space 
in  management determined that we would not be able to utilize this vacated office space 
this determination eliminated the economic benefit associated with the vacated office space 
as a result  we recorded million of contract termination costs in  mainly due to costs that will continue to be incurred under the lease contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to us 
these termination costs were recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized  at fair value  when the liability is incurred rather than at the time an entity commits to a plan 
in and  we recaptured  and  respectively  of these costs relating to the settlement of the abandoned space 
we continually look for ways to either settle or sublease our remaining abandoned real estate and review  as necessary  our assumptions associated with our abandoned real estate 
the average remaining lease term for the lease obligations included herein is approximately years 
additional information on exit costs can be found in footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
executive summary we believe that economic conditions strengthened in  both in the united states and abroad  which favorably impacts both mps and our industry 
for  we were able to grow revenue in all of our operating units 
in addition to the improved macroeconomic conditions  we believe this growth resulted from our investments in staff  the ability to execute our acquisition strategy  new service offerings  and new office openings 
we expect our revenue to continue to be impacted by general macroeconomic conditions in our revenue increased from  while our operating income increased from however  our gross margin decreased basis points due to lower gross margins in our it services division and european professional services segment  and a higher concentration of our revenue being generated from our lowest gross margin segment  the european it services segment 
for  we will continue to look for opportunities to increase gross margin along with increasing operating leverage within each segment 
in addition  we have a foundation for growth with more than million of cash on hand at year end  a million credit facility with no outstanding borrowings  no long term debt  and working capital of million

we increased our staff headcount by in in anticipation of increased demand 
the increase in revenue in was due primarily to diversifying our client base including moving into sectors  such as public sector and not for profit organizations that we historically have not relied upon 
traditionally  this segment has focused on servicing financial services  accounting and finance  and human resources clients

changes in foreign currency exchange rates contributed million in gross profit from to  and million from to gross margin in our european professional services segment was   and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin in was due to a shift in the mix of services provided by this segment along with the increased competition for candidates 
we have been able to increase our bill rates in from our and levels 
however  the increased competition for candidates has led to a greater increase in pay rates  and therefore a decrease in the bill and pay rate spread

it services division north american it services segment revenue in our north american it services segment was million  million  and million  for  and  respectively  increasing by in and decreasing by in the increase in revenue in was due to a combination of increased spending on it initiatives by our clients and our investment in staff 
in order to capitalize on the improving macroeconomic trends  we increased our staff headcount by during revenue from this segment in was adversely impacted by the diminished demand for it related services 
specifically  our customers in continued to experience a constrained ability to spend on it initiatives due to uncertainties relating to the economy 
revenue within the north american it services segment is generated primarily from modis  as it generated  and of the segment s revenue for  and  respectively

table of contents gross profit in our north american it services segment was million  million  and million  in  and  respectively  increasing by in and decreasing by in gross margin in our north american it services segment was   and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin in was due primarily to lower utilization of idea integration s salaried consultants and to modis increased presence on national vendor lists 
revenue from clients on a national vendor list tends to generate a lower gross margin due to these clients buying power 
modis was able to stabilize gross margin in the second half of by increasing its proportion of revenue from middle market clients  which tend to generate a higher gross margin 
in conjunction with the uncertainties surrounding the economy in and  our clients reduced the number of approved vendors 
we looked for modis to remain on these vendor lists so that we would be poised for growth when macroeconomic conditions were more favorable 
the increase in gross margin in was due primarily to higher utilization of idea integration s salaried consultants and modis more effectively managing the bill and pay rates spread

in and  we recaptured  and  respectively  of the costs relating to the settlement of the abandoned office space 
changes to the local real estate economy where we have this abandoned real estate  and other factors originally unforeseen to us  allowed us the opportunity to either settle or find acceptable subleasing opportunities earlier than or for more than what we originally anticipated

table of contents liquidity and capital resources changes to our liquidity during  and are due primarily to the net effect of i funds generated by operations and stock option exercises  and ii funds used for acquisitions  repurchases of common stock and capital expenditures 
we expect this to be consistent for in  cash of million used in both investing and financing activities exceeded the million of cash provided from operating activities  the effect of exchange rates and discontinued operations 
our net use of cash in was due to the following our increased acquisition activity  the use of our board approved stock repurchase program  and a lower level of cash provided by operations 
in  cash of million provided from operating activities  financing activities  the effect of exchange rates and discontinued operations  exceeded the million of cash used for investing activities

the below table highlights working capital and cash and cash equivalents as of december   and  respectively december  dollar amounts in millions working capital cash and cash equivalents for   and  we generated million  million  and million of cash flow from operations  respectively 
the decrease in cash flow from operations in  was due primarily to the use of working capital to support our revenue growth 
this growth increased the cash needed to fund accounts receivable  as we collect receivables within an average of days  while primarily paying our employees on a weekly basis 
the decrease in cash flow from operations in  from  was due primarily to the normalizing of receivables collection 
in and  the main elements of our back office integration and consolidation efforts were being completed 
these efforts led to substantial improvements in receivables collection for for  we used million of cash for investing activities  of which million  net of cash acquired  was used for acquisitions  and million was used for capital expenditures 
these uses were partially offset by million of proceeds from the sale of certain assets of our executive search brand

for  we used million of cash for financing activities  primarily for million of repayments on our previous credit facility  net of million generated from stock option exercises 
in addition  we used million for stock repurchases 
these repayments were mainly funded from cash flows from operations 
our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
we repurchased million shares at a cost of million in  which brought the total amount repurchased under this plan to million shares at a cost of million at december  we anticipate that we will continue to purchase shares under this authorization in the future 
we have not repurchased any shares to date in 
table of contents we anticipate that capital expenditures for furniture and equipment  including improvements to our management information and operating systems  during the next twelve months  will be approximately million 
while there can be no assurance in this regard  we believe that funds provided by operations  available borrowings under the credit facility  and current amounts of cash will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated needs for working capital  capital expenditures  repurchases of common stock and acquisitions for at least the next months 
indebtedness  contractual obligations  and commercial commitments of the company the following are contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments at december  payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years contractual cash obligations operating leases other total contractual cash obligations amount of commitment expiration per period total less than year years years after years standby letters of credit total commercial commitments in  we closed on a million revolving credit facility syndicated by a group of leading financial institutions 
the credit facility contains certain financial and non financial covenants relating to our operations  including maintaining certain financial ratios 
repayment  if applicable  of funds borrowed under the credit facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries 
the facility matures in november at december  and march   there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility  other than million of standby letters of credit for certain operational matters 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued staff position fsp no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp 
fsp provides guidance under fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of the jobs act on enterprises income tax expense and deferred tax liability 
fsp states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the jobs act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying fasb statement no 
based upon our preliminary evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision  we do not expect to apply this provision 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following assessment of our market risks does not include uncertainties that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable  such as political  economic  tax and credit risks 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations under the credit facility and to our investments 
we have an investment portfolio consisting of cash and cash equivalents including deposits in banks  money market funds  and short term investments with maturities of days or less 
we are adverse to principal loss and seek to preserve our invested funds by placing these funds with high credit quality issuers 
we evaluate our invested funds to respond appropriately to a reduction in the credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
we are exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies 
our international operations generated approximately of consolidated revenue  approximately of which was from the united kingdom 
our international operations transact business in their functional currency 
as a result  fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar have an impact on reported results 
revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into u 
s dollars at monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
consequently  as the value of the us dollar changes relative to the currencies of our us markets  our reported results vary 
fluctuations in exchange rates impact the us dollar amount of stockholders equity 
the assets and liabilities of our non us subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of a reporting period 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders equity  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  in our consolidated balance sheets 
we prepared a sensitivity analysis to determine the adverse impact of hypothetical changes in the british pound sterling  relative to the us dollar  on our results of operations and cash flows 
however  the analysis did not include the potential impact on sales levels resulting from a change in the british pound sterling 
an additional adverse movement in the exchange rate would have had an immaterial impact on our cash flows and financial position at december  while fluctuations in the british pound sterling have not historically had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  the higher level of earnings resulting from an increase in demand for the services provided by our international operations have increased the impact of exchange rate fluctuations
