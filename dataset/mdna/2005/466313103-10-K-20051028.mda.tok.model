overview we are one of the leading providers of worldwide electronic manufacturing services and solutions 
we provide comprehensive electronics design  production  product management and repair services to companies in the aerospace  automotive  computing  consumer  defense  industrial  instrumentation  medical  networking  peripherals  storage and telecommunications industries 
the historical growth of the overall industry over most of the s was driven by the increasing number of companies who chose to outsource their manufacturing requirements 
in mid  the industry s revenue declined as a result of significant cut backs in customer production requirements  which was consistent with the overall global economic downturn at that time 
industry revenues generally began to stabilize in and companies continue to turn to outsourcing versus internal manufacturing 
we anticipate that this industry outsourcing trend will continue during the next several years 
we derive revenue principally from the product sales of electronic equipment built to customer specifications 
we recognize revenue  net of estimated product return costs  generally when goods are shipped  title and risk of ownership have passed  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and recoverability is reasonably assured 
the volume and timing of orders placed by our customers vary due to several factors  including variation in demand for our customers products  our customers attempts to manage their inventory  electronic design changes  changes in our customers manufacturing strategies  and acquisitions of or consolidations among our customers 
demand for our customers products depends on  among other things  product life cycles  competitive conditions and general economic conditions 
our cost of revenue includes the cost of electronic components and other materials that comprise the products we manufacture  the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead  and adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory 
as a provider of turnkey manufacturing services  we are responsible for procuring components and other materials 
this requires us to commit significant working capital to our operations and to manage the purchasing  receiving  inspection and stocking of materials 
although we bear the risk of fluctuations in the cost of materials and excess scrap  we periodically negotiate cost of materials adjustments with our customers 
net revenue from each product that we manufacture consists of an element based on the costs of materials in that product and an element based on the labor and manufacturing overhead costs allocated to that product 
we refer to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on materials costs as material based revenue  and to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on labor and manufacturing overhead costs as manufacturing based revenue 
our gross margin for any product depends on the mix between the cost of materials in the product and the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead allocated to the product 
we typically realize higher gross margins on manufacturing based revenue than we do on materials based revenue 
as we gain experience in manufacturing a product  we usually achieve increased efficiencies  which result in lower labor and manufacturing overhead costs for that product 
our operating results are impacted by the level of capacity utilization of manufacturing facilities  indirect labor costs  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high production volume and high capacity utilization 
during periods of low production volume  we generally have idle capacity and reduced operating income margins 
as our capacity has grown during recent years through the construction of new greenfield facilities  the expansion of existing facilities and our acquisition of additional facilities  our selling  general and administrative expenses have increased to support this growth 
we have consistently utilized advanced circuit design  production design and manufacturing technologies to meet the needs of our customers 
to support this effort  our engineering staff focuses on 
table of contents developing and refining design and manufacturing technologies to meet specific needs of specific customers 
most of the expenses associated with these customer specific efforts are reflected in our cost of revenue 
in addition  our engineers engage in r d of new technologies that apply generally to our operations 
the expenses of these r d activities are reflected in the research and development line item in our consolidated statement of earnings 
an important element of our strategy is the expansion of our global production facilities 
the majority of our revenue and materials costs worldwide are denominated in us dollars  while our labor and utility costs in plants outside the united states are denominated in local currencies 
we hedge these local currency costs  based on our evaluation of the potential exposure as compared to the cost of the hedge  through the purchase of foreign exchange contracts 
changes in the fair market value of such hedging instruments are reflected in the consolidated statement of earnings 
see risk factors we are subject to risks of currency fluctuations and related hedging operations 
we currently depend  and expect to continue to depend  upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue 
a significant reduction in sales to any of our large customers or a customer exerting significant pricing and margin pressures on us would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in the past  some of our customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangements with us or have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of manufacturing services ordered from us 
there can be no assurance that present or future customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us or significantly change  reduce or delay the amount of manufacturing services ordered from us 
any such termination of a manufacturing relationship or change  reduction or delay in orders could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
see risk factors because we depend on a limited number of customers  a reduction in sales to any one of our customers could cause a significant decline in our revenue and note concentration of risk and segment data to the consolidated financial statements 
summary of results net revenue for fiscal year increased percent to billion compared to billion for fiscal year our sales levels during fiscal year improved across most industry sectors  demonstrating our continued trend of industry sector and customer diversification 
the increase in our net revenue base year over year primarily represents stronger demand from existing programs  as well as organic growth from new and existing customers 
the following table sets forth  for the fiscal year ended august  certain key operating results and other financial information in thousands  except per share data 
fiscal year ended august  net revenue gross profit operating income net income basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share 
table of contents key performance indicators management regularly reviews financial and non financial performance indicators to assess the company s operating results 
the following table sets forth  for the quarterly periods indicated  certain of management s key financial performance indicators 
three months ended august  may  february  november  sales cycle days days days days inventory turns turns turns turns turns days in accounts receivable days days days days days in inventory days days days days days in accounts payable days days days days three months ended august  may  february  november  sales cycle days days days days inventory turns turns turns turns turns days in accounts receivable days days days days days in inventory days days days days days in accounts payable days days days days the sales cycle is calculated as the sum of days in accounts receivable and days in inventory  less the days in accounts payable  accordingly  the variance in the sales cycle quarter over quarter is a direct result of changes in these indicators 
days in accounts receivable have remained consistent during the three months ended august  from the prior sequential quarter 
during the three months ended may   days in accounts receivable decreased by three days due to the sale of receivables to an unrelated third party 
this decrease was offset by a three day increase in days in accounts receivable due to the timing of sales during the third fiscal quarter and the assumption of receivables in connection with our acquisition of varian electronics manufacturing vem  the electronics manufacturing business segment of varian  inc the ten day decrease in accounts receivable days for the three months ended february  resulted primarily from the liquidation during such quarter of six days of receivables assumed in connection with our acquisition of certain operations of philips in kwidzyn  poland at the end of the first quarter of fiscal the remainder of the decrease reflects lower sales levels and timing of sales during the second quarter of fiscal days in inventory increased two days during the three months ended august  from the prior sequential quarter  resulting in a decrease in inventory turns to nine 
the two day increase in days during the fourth fiscal quarter was primarily due to increased purchasing to meet forecasted demand in the first quarter of fiscal year  which includes the seasonal peak for the consumer and automotive industry sectors 
days in inventory decreased two days during the three months ended may  from the prior sequential quarter as a result of increased sales during this period and the continued emphasis on inventory management 
inventory levels at february  were elevated due to ramping for the third fiscal quarter production forecasts 
the improvement in days in inventory resulted in ten inventory turns during the three months ended may   as compared to nine inventory turns in the prior sequential quarter 
days in accounts payable increased five days during the three months ended august  from the prior sequential quarter primarily as a result of increased inventory levels and continued emphasis on extending payment terms with our vendors 
days in accounts payable increased one day during the three months ended may  from the prior sequential quarter primarily due to the timing of payments due to vendors 
the six day decrease in days in accounts payable during the three months ended february  from the prior sequential quarter resulted from the liquidation during such quarter of six days of 
table of contents payables assumed in connection with our acquisition of certain operations of philips in kwidzyn  poland at the end of the first quarter of fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for further discussion of our significant accounting policies  refer to note description of business and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive revenue principally from the product sales of electronic equipment built to customer specifications 
we also derive revenue to a lesser extent from repair services  design services and excess inventory sales 
revenue from product sales and excess inventory sales is generally recognized  net of estimated product return costs  when goods are shipped  title and risk of ownership have passed  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and recoverability is reasonably assured 
service related revenues are recognized upon completion of the services 
we assume no significant obligations after product shipment 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts related to receivables not expected to be collected from our customers 
this allowance is based on management s assessment of specific customer balances  considering the age of receivables and financial stability of the customer 
if there is an adverse change in the financial condition of our customers  or if actual defaults are higher than provided for  an addition to the allowance may be necessary 
inventory valuation we purchase inventory based on forecasted demand and record inventory at the lower of cost or market 
management regularly assesses inventory valuation based on current and forecasted usage and other lower of cost or market considerations 
if actual market conditions or our customers product demands are less favorable than those projected  additional valuation adjustments may be necessary 
long lived assets we review property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of property  plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the projected cash flows the property  plant and equipment are expected to generate 
if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the long lived asset over its respective fair value 
the impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management  including revenue and cash flow projections 
circumstances that may lead to impairment of property  plant and equipment include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand and the restructuring of our operations resulting from a change in our business strategy 
we have recorded intangible assets  including goodwill  principally based on third party valuations  in connection with business acquisitions 
estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are determined by management based on an assessment of the period over which the asset is expected to 
table of contents contribute to future cash flows 
the allocation of amortizable intangible assets impacts the amounts allocable to goodwill 
in accordance with sfas  we are required to perform a goodwill impairment test at least on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows 
we completed the annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal and determined that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test 
the impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level  which we have determined to be consistent with our operating segments as defined in note concentration of risk and segment data to the consolidated financial statements 
the impairment analysis is based on assumptions of future results made by management  including revenue and cash flow projections at the reporting unit level 
circumstances that may lead to impairment of goodwill or intangible assets include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand  and the restructuring of our operations resulting from a change in our business strategy 
for further information on our intangible assets  including goodwill  refer to note goodwill and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements 
restructuring and impairment charges we have recognized restructuring and impairment charges related to reductions in workforce  re sizing and closure of facilities and the transition of certain facilities into new customer development sites 
these charges were recorded pursuant to formal plans developed and approved by management 
the recognition of restructuring and impairment charges requires that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature  timing and amount of costs associated with these plans 
the estimates of future liabilities may change  requiring additional restructuring and impairment charges or the reduction of liabilities already recorded 
at the end of each reporting period  we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with the restructuring programs 
for further discussion of our restructuring programs  refer to note restructuring and impairment charges to the consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations restructuring and impairment charges 
pension and postretirement benefits we have pension and postretirement benefit costs and liabilities  which are developed from actuarial valuations 
actuarial valuations require management to make certain judgments and estimates of discount rates and return on plan assets 
we evaluate these assumptions on a regular basis taking into consideration current market conditions and historical market data 
the discount rate is used to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
this rate represents the market rate for high quality fixed income investments 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
when considering the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets  we take into account current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on plan assets 
other assumptions include demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover 
for further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefits  refer to note pension and other postretirement benefits to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we estimate our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  a process that includes estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities 
we must also make judgments regarding the ability to realize the deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets that we do not believe meet the more likely than not criteria established by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
our judgments regarding future taxable income may change due to changes in market conditions  changes in tax laws or other factors 
if our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future  the valuation 
table of contents allowances we have established may be increased or decreased  resulting in a respective increase or decrease in either income tax expense or goodwill 
for further discussion related to our income taxes  refer to note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain operating data as a percentage of net revenue fiscal year ended august  net revenue cost of revenue gross profit selling  general and administrative research and development amortization of intangibles acquisition related charges restructuring and impairment charges operating income other loss income interest income interest expense income before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year ended august  net revenue 
our net revenue increased to billion for fiscal year  up from billion in fiscal year the increase was due to increased sales levels across most industry sectors 
specific increases include a increase in the sale of consumer products  a increase in the sale of instrumentation and medical products  a increase in the sale of peripheral products  a increase in the sale of computing and storage products  and a increase in the sale of automotive products 
the increased sales levels were due to the addition of new customers  acquisitions and organic growth in these industry sectors 
the increase in the consumer industry sector was primarily attributable to new and existing program growth resulting from our product diversification efforts within the sector 
the increase in the instrumentation and medical industry sector was primarily attributable to increased sales levels as more vertical companies are electing to outsource their production in these areas  and the acquisition of vem 
these increases were offset by an decrease in the sale of telecommunications products and an decrease in the sale of networking products 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  revenue by industry sector expressed as a percentage of net revenue 
the distribution of revenue across our industry sectors has fluctuated  and will continue to fluctuate  as a result of numerous factors  including but not limited to the following increased business from new and existing customers  fluctuations in customer demand  seasonality  especially in the automotive and consumer industry sectors  and increased growth in the automotive  consumer  and instrumentation and medical products industry sectors as more vertical companies are electing to outsource their production in these areas 

table of contents fiscal year ended august  automotive computing and storage consumer instrumentation and medical networking peripherals telecommunications other total foreign source revenue represented of our net revenue for fiscal year and of net revenue for fiscal year we expect our foreign source revenue to increase as a percentage of total net revenue due to expansion in china  eastern europe and india  and due to the continued shift of production to lower cost regions 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to of net revenue in fiscal year from in fiscal year the percentage decrease from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to a higher portion of materials based revenue driven in part by growth in the consumer industry sector  combined with the continued shift of production to lower cost regions 
in absolute dollars  gross profit for fiscal year increased million versus fiscal year due to the increased revenue base 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of net revenue in fiscal year from million of net revenue in fiscal year the absolute dollar increase was primarily due to additional personnel costs related to the realignment of our organizational structure into three regional operating segments  costs related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  and the acquisition of vem in march the decrease as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to the increased revenue base 
r d 
r d expenses in fiscal year increased to million of net revenue from million of net revenue in fiscal year the increase is attributed to growth in our product development activities related to new reference designs  including networking and server products  cell phone products  wireless and broadband access products  consumer products  and storage products 
we also continued efforts in the design of circuit board assembly  mechanical design and the related production design process  and the development of new advanced manufacturing technologies 
amortization of intangibles 
we recorded million of amortization of intangibles in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the decrease was attributable to intangible assets that became fully amortized in fiscal year  offset by amortization of intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions consummated in fiscal year for additional information regarding purchased intangibles  see acquisitions and expansion below  note f description of business and summary of significant accounting policies goodwill and other intangible assets  note goodwill and other intangible assets and note business acquisitions and other transactions to the consolidated financial statements 
acquisition related charges 
during fiscal year  we did not incur acquisition related charges 
during fiscal year  we incurred million in acquisition related charges in connection with the acquisitions of certain operations of philips and nec 
restructuring and impairment charges 
there were no restructuring and impairment charges incurred during fiscal years and at august   liabilities related to restructuring activities 
table of contents carried out prior to august  totaled approximately million for lease commitment costs  which is expected to be paid out within the next twelve months 
the historical restructuring programs discussed in note restructuring and impairment charges to the consolidated financial statements allowed us to align our production capacity and shift our geographic footprint to meet current customer requirements 
we continuously evaluate our operations and cost structure relative to general economic conditions  market demands and cost competitiveness  and our geographic footprint as it relates to our customers production requirements 
a change in any of these factors could result in additional restructuring and impairment charges in the future 
other loss income 
during fiscal year  we recorded a million loss on the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs  which resulted from the redemption of our convertible subordinated notes in may see note notes payable  long term debt and long term lease obligations to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the redemption 
interest income 
interest income increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase was primarily due to higher interest yields on cash deposits and short term investments  and interest income recorded in relation to the note receivable from an unrelated third party 
for further discussion of the note receivable  see note business acquisitions and other transactions to the condensed consolidated financial statements 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal year  from million in fiscal year the increase was primarily a result of higher base interest rates related to our million senior notes issued in july of the senior notes  as we had an interest rate swap in place that effectively converted the fixed interest rate of the senior notes to a variable rate through the interest rate swap termination date of june  the increase was also a result of temporary borrowings under the revolving credit facility and debt agreements entered into during the third quarter of fiscal year in connection with the vem acquisition 
the increase for fiscal year was partially offset by the redemption of our convertible notes in may see note notes payable  long term debt and long term lease obligations to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of for fiscal year  as compared to an effective tax rate of for fiscal year the tax rate is predominantly a function of the mix of tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we do business 
our international operations have historically been taxed at a lower rate than in the united states  primarily due to tax incentives  including tax holidays  granted to our sites in brazil  china  hungary  india  malaysia and poland that expire at various dates through such tax holidays are subject to conditions with which we expect to continue to comply

in october  the president signed into law the american jobs creation act of the act 
the act creates a temporary incentive for us multinational companies to repatriate accumulated foreign earnings by providing an dividends received deduction for certain eligible dividends the deduction is subject to a number of limitations and requirements  including a formal plan for domestic reinvestment of the dividends 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp 
fsp provides guidance under sfas with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the act on enterprises income tax expense and deferred tax liability 
fsp states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying sfas the company may make this election with respect to repatriation of qualifying earnings in either fiscal year or we are currently evaluating the effects of the repatriation provision and expect to complete the evaluation no later than the end of the second quarter of fiscal year at this time  the range of earnings that may be repatriated and the potential range of income tax effects of such repatriation cannot be reasonably estimated 

table of contents fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year ended august  net revenue 
our net revenue increased to billion for fiscal year  up from billion in fiscal year the increase was due to increased sales levels across all industry sectors 
specific increases included a increase in the sale of consumer products  a increase in the sale of instrumentation and medical products  a increase in the sale of networking products  an increase in the sale of automotive products  a increase in the sale of computing and storage products  a increase in the sale of peripheral products  and a increase in the sale of telecommunications products 
the increased sales levels were due to the addition of new customers  acquisitions and organic growth in these industry sectors 
the increase in the consumer industry sector was primarily attributable to the acquisition of certain operations of philips during fiscal year the increase in the instrumentation and medical industry sector was primarily attributable to increased sales levels as more vertical companies are electing to outsource their production in these areas 
foreign source revenue represented of our net revenue for fiscal year and of net revenue for fiscal year the increase in foreign source revenue was primarily attributable to incremental revenue resulting from our acquisitions in austria  brazil  belgium  china  hungary  india  japan  malaysia  mexico  poland and singapore during fiscal year gross profit 
gross profit decreased to of net revenue in fiscal year from in fiscal year the percentage decrease was primarily due to a higher portion of materials based revenue driven in part by growth in the consumer industry sector  combined with the continued shift of production to lower cost regions 
the mix of value add based revenue from our acquisitions also contributed to the decrease 
additionally  we were awarded a significant amount of new business during fiscal year the level of activity required to integrate new business into our factories typically has a slightly dilutive impact on gross profit during the initial period of production where certain costs are incurred before any corresponding increase in revenues might occur 
as production for the new business increases  the contribution to gross profit typically increases 
the percentage decrease in gross profit for fiscal year versus fiscal year was partially offset by cost reductions realized from our restructuring activities in previous fiscal years 
in absolute dollars  gross profit for fiscal year increased million versus fiscal year due to the increased revenue base 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of net revenue in fiscal year from million of net revenue in fiscal year the absolute dollar increase was primarily attributable to operations acquired during fiscal year and to operations in facilities for which construction was completed during fiscal year these increases were partially offset by million of quarterly cost reductions realized from our restructuring activities 
the decrease as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to the increased revenue base in fiscal year and the cost reductions realized from our restructuring activities 
r d 
r d expenses in fiscal year increased to million from million in fiscal year but remained at of net revenue for each of the fiscal years ended august  and we continued to engage in r d activities at our historical levels 
these activities included design of circuit board assemblies and the related production process  development of new products and products associated with customer design related programs  and new failure analysis techniques 
amortization of intangibles 
we recorded million of amortization of intangibles in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the increase was attributable to acquired amortizable intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions consummated in fiscal year for additional information regarding purchased intangibles  see acquisitions and expansion below  note f description of business and summary of significant accounting policies goodwill and other intangible assets  and note goodwill and other intangible assets

during fiscal year  we incurred million in acquisition related charges in connection with the acquisitions of certain operations of quantum  alcatel  valeo  lucent  seagate  philips and nec 
restructuring and impairment charges 
there were no restructuring and impairment charges incurred during fiscal year during fiscal year  we continued a restructuring program to reduce our cost structure and further align our manufacturing capacity with geographic production demands of our customers 
this restructuring program resulted in restructuring and impairment charges of million for fiscal year at august   liabilities related to our restructuring activities totaled approximately million 
approximately million of this total was expected to be paid out within the next twelve months for severance and benefit payments related to the remaining restructuring activities and lease commitment costs 
the remaining balance  consisting of lease commitment costs  is expected to be paid out through august  as a result of the restructuring activities completed through august   we realized a cumulative cost savings of approximately million during fiscal year this cost savings consisted of million reduction in cost of revenue due to a reduction in employee payroll and benefit expense of million and million in depreciation expense  and million reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses 
other loss income 
during fiscal year  we recorded a million loss on the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs  which resulted from the redemption of our convertible subordinated notes in may see note notes payable  long term debt and long term lease obligations to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the redemption 
during fiscal year  we recorded million of other income related to proceeds received in the first quarter of fiscal year in connection with facility closure costs 
interest income 
interest income increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase was primarily due to higher average cash balances  partially offset by lower interest yields on cash deposits and short term investments 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal year  from million in fiscal year this increase was primarily a result of the issuance of our million  seven year  senior notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  which are effectively converted to a variable rate by our interest rate swap 
this increase was partially offset by the redemption of our convertible subordinated notes in may see note notes payable  long term debt and long term lease obligations to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of for fiscal year  as compared to an income tax benefit of for fiscal year the tax rate is predominantly a function of the mix of tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we do business 
the amount of restructuring charges recorded during fiscal year  and the fact that the income taxes associated with the restructuring charges were calculated using the effective tax rates in the jurisdictions in which those charges were incurred  resulted in an income tax benefit in the prior fiscal year 
in addition  as the proportion of our income derived from foreign sources has increased  our effective tax rate  excluding the impact of restructuring charges  has decreased 
our international operations have historically been taxed at a lower rate than in the united states  primarily due to tax incentives  including tax holidays  granted to our sites in brazil  china  hungary  malaysia  poland  and ukraine that expire at various dates through as of august  such tax holidays are subject to conditions with which we expect to continue to comply

for further discussion of our recent and planned acquisitions  see note business acquisitions and other transactions and note subsequent event to the consolidated financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we commenced operations in phase one of our new facility in szombathely  hungary  which will support our repair services operations in europe 
we expect to complete the second phase of construction in the second quarter of fiscal year also during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we completed construction of and commenced operations in our new manufacturing facility in ranjangaon  india 
construction of our new manufacturing facility in wuxi  china continues and we expect to commence operations in this facility by the second quarter of fiscal year seasonality production levels for our consumer and automotive industry sectors are subject to seasonal influences 
we may realize greater net revenue during our first fiscal quarter due to high demand for consumer products during the holiday selling season 
liquidity and capital resources at august   we had cash and cash equivalent balances totaling million  total notes payable  long term debt and capital lease obligations of million and million available for borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and accounts receivable securitization program 

table of contents the following table sets forth  for the fiscal year ended august  selected consolidated cash flow information in thousands fiscal year ended august  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year was million 
this consisted primarily of million of net income  million of depreciation and amortization  million from increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and million from decreases in prepaid expenses and other current assets 
the increase in accounts payable was due to the increase in inventory and timing of purchases near year end 
additionally  accrued compensation and employee benefits increased over the prior fiscal year due to the increase in number of employees at august  these sources of cash were partially offset by increases in inventory of million and increases in accounts receivable of million 
the increase in inventory was due to increased levels of business during fiscal year and positioning for estimated future demand 
the increase in accounts receivable was due to the increased revenue base and the timing of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year net cash used in investing activities for fiscal year was million 
this consisted primarily of our capital expenditures of million for manufacturing and computer equipment to support our ongoing business and expansion activities in china  eastern europe and india  and net cash of million paid primarily for the acquisition of certain television assembly operations of philips in kwidzyn and the acquisition of vem 
additionally  during the third quarter of fiscal year  we entered into several agreements for investing purposes that resulted in cash disbursements of million for long term notes receivable and other short term assets 
these expenditures and disbursements were offset by million of proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year was million 
this resulted from million in borrowings under debt agreements and million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under option plans and employee stock purchase plans 
these cash proceeds were partially offset by million of payments toward debt agreements and capital lease obligations  and a million payment upon the termination of our interest rate swap agreement 
during fiscal year  we borrowed million indian rupees and million euros approximately million and million  respectively  based on currency exchange rates at august  under new debt agreements  as discussed below 
in march we borrowed million under our then existing unsecured revolving credit facility to partially fund the acquisition of vem 
this borrowing was repaid in full prior to may  in december we entered into a million short term borrowing agreement  based on currency exchange rates at the borrowing date  for a polish subsidiary with a polish bank 
this short term borrowing was repaid in full prior to february  payments toward debt agreements also included approximately million  based on currency exchange rates at the payment dates  to extinguish the outstanding balance of our five year term loan for a japanese subsidiary with a japanese bank 
see note notes payable  long term debt and long term lease obligations and note stockholders equity to the consolidated financial statements 
we may need to finance future growth and any corresponding working capital needs with additional borrowings under our revolving credit facilities described below  as well as additional public and private offerings of our debt and equity 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we filed a million shelf registration statement with the sec registering the potential sale of debt and equity securities in the future  from time to time  to augment our liquidity and capital resources 
in june  we sold million shares of our common stock pursuant to our shelf registration statement  which generated 
table of contents net proceeds of million 
in august  we increased the amount of securities available to be issued under a shelf registration statement to billion 
in may  we issued a total of million  year  convertible subordinated notes the convertible notes at par  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
the convertible notes were issued pursuant to our shelf registration statement 
the convertible notes were to mature on may  and paid interest semiannually on may and november under the terms of the convertible notes  the note holders had the right to require us to purchase all or a portion of their convertible notes on may in the years   and at par plus accrued interest 
additionally  we had the right to redeem all or a portion of the convertible notes for cash at any time on or after may  on may   we paid million par value to certain note holders who exercised their right to require us to purchase their convertible notes 
on may   we paid million par value upon exercise of our right to redeem the remaining convertible notes outstanding 
in addition to the par value of the convertible notes  we paid accrued and unpaid interest of approximately million to the note holders 
as a result of these transactions  we recognized a loss of million on the write off of unamortized issuance costs associated with the convertible notes 
this loss was recorded as an other loss in the consolidated statement of earnings for the fiscal year ended august  in july  we issued a total of million  seven year  senior notes senior notes at of par  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
the senior notes were offered pursuant to our shelf registration statement 
the senior notes mature on july  and pay interest semiannually on january and july approximately million of securities remain registered with the sec under our shelf registration statement at august  the securities act of the act offering reform  which will go into effect on december   will significantly modify the registration and offering process under the act 
based on the new registration and offering regime  we may file a new shelf registration statement to replace the existing shelf 
under the new rules  we anticipate that jabil will be classified as a well known seasoned issuer  thereby allowing the company to take advantage of the simplified registration procedures 
at this time  the company is still evaluating whether to file a new shelf registration statement 
in the meantime  the company may still issue securities under its existing shelf registration statement 
in july  we entered into an interest rate swap transaction to effectively convert the fixed interest rate of our senior notes to a variable rate 
the swap  which was to expire in  was accounted for as a fair value hedge under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and certain hedging activities sfas 
the notional amount of the swap was million  which is related to the senior notes 
under the terms of the swap  we paid an interest rate equal to the six month london interbank offered rate libor rate  set in arrears  plus a fixed spread of 
in exchange  we received a fixed rate of 
the swap transaction qualified for the shortcut method of recognition under sfas  therefore no portion of the swap was treated as ineffective 
the interest rate swap was terminated on june  the fair value of the interest rate swap of million was recorded in long term liabilities  with the corresponding offset recorded as a decrease to the carrying value of the senior notes  on the consolidated balance sheet at the termination date 
in addition  we had recorded million of interest receivable from the issuing bank as of the termination date 
upon termination  jabil made a net million cash payment to the issuing bank to derecognize the interest rate swap and the accrued interest 
the million decrease to the carrying value of the senior notes on the consolidated balance sheet will be amortized to earnings through interest expense over the remaining term of the debt 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  we negotiated a six month  billion japanese yen jpy approximately million based on currency exchange rates at the time credit facility for a japanese subsidiary with a japanese bank 
under the terms of the credit facility  interest accrued on outstanding borrowings based on the tokyo interbank offered rate tibor plus a spread of 

table of contents the credit facility was to expire on december  and any outstanding borrowings would then be due and payable 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we borrowed billion jpy on this facility 
the cash proceeds  which translated to million based on foreign currency rates in effect at the date of the borrowing  were used to partially fund the acquisition of certain operations of nec in gotemba  japan 
on august   we renegotiated the previously existing billion jpy credit facility by converting it into a five year term loan japan term loan  with the final principal payment due may  we paid interest on the japan term loan quarterly at a fixed annual rate of 
the japan term loan required quarterly repayments of principal of million jpy 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company extinguished the outstanding balance of the japan term loan 
the japan term loan required compliance with financial and operating covenants including maintaining a minimum equity balance at the respective subsidiary level 
we were in compliance with the respective covenants through the date of extinguishment 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we renewed our existing billion japanese yen approximately million based on currency exchange rates at august  credit facility for a japanese subsidiary with a japanese bank 
under the terms of the facility  we pay interest on outstanding borrowings based on the tokyo interbank offered rate plus a spread of 
the credit facility expires on december  and any outstanding borrowings are then due and payable 
we currently anticipate that we will renew this facility in the first quarter of fiscal year at august   there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we amended and revised our then existing credit facility and established a three year  million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks the amended revolver 
under the terms of the amended revolver  borrowings could be made under either floating rate loans or eurodollar rate loans 
interest accrued on outstanding floating rate loans at the greater of the agent s prime rate or plus the federal funds rate 
interest accrued on outstanding eurodollar loans at the london interbank offered rate libor in effect at the loan inception plus a spread of to 
a facility fee based on the committed amount of the amended revolver was payable at a rate equal to to 
a usage fee was also payable if our borrowings on the amended revolver exceeded of the aggregate commitment 
the usage fee rate ranged from to 
the interest spread  facility fee and usage fee were determined based on our general corporate rating or rating of our senior unsecured long term indebtedness as determined by standard and poor s rating service s p and moody s investor service moody s 
the amended revolver had an expiration date of july  when outstanding borrowings would then be due and payable 
the amended revolver required compliance with several financial covenants including a fixed charge coverage ratio  consolidated net worth threshold and indebtedness to ebitda ratio  as defined in the amended revolver 
the amended revolver required compliance with certain operating covenants  which limited  among other things  our incurrence of additional indebtedness 
on march   we borrowed million under the amended revolver to partially fund the acquisition of vem  which was consummated on march  this borrowing was repaid in full during the third quarter of fiscal year from cash provided by operations 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  we replaced the amended revolver and established a five year  million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks the unsecured revolver 
the unsecured revolver  which expires on may   may be increased to a maximum of million at the request of the company if approved by the lenders 
such requests must be for an increase of at least million or an integral multiple thereof  and may only be made once per calendar year 
interest and fees on unsecured revolver advances are based on the company s senior unsecured long term indebtedness rating as determined by s p and moody s 
interest is charged at either the base rate or a rate equal to to above the eurocurrency rate  where the base rate  available for us dollar advances only  represents the greater of the agent s prime rate or plus the federal funds rate  and the eurocurrency rate represents the applicable libor  each as more fully defined in the unsecured revolver 
fees include a facility fee based on the total commitments of the lenders  a letter of credit fee based on the amount of outstanding letters of credit  and a utilization fee to be added to the 
table of contents interest rate and the letter of credit fee during any period when the aggregate amount of outstanding advances and letters of credit exceeds of the total commitments of the lenders 
based on the company s current senior unsecured long term indebtedness rating as determined by s p and moody s  the current rate of interest plus the applicable facility and utilization fee on a full eurocurrency rate draw would be above the eurocurrency rate as defined above 
among other things  the unsecured revolver contains financial covenants establishing a debt to ebitda ratio and interest coverage ratio  and contains operating covenants  which limit  among other things  our incurrence of indebtedness at the subsidiary level  and the incurrence of liens at all levels 
the various covenants  limitations and events of default included in the unsecured revolver are currently customary for similar facilities for similarly rated borrowers 
the company was in compliance with the respective covenants at august  at august   there were no borrowings outstanding on the unsecured revolver 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we entered into an asset backed securitization program with a bank  which originally provided for net cash proceeds at any one time of up to million on the sale of eligible accounts receivable of certain domestic operations 
as a result of an amendment in april  the program was increased to up to million of net cash proceeds at any one time 
as a result of a second amendment in february  the program was renewed and increased to up to million of net cash proceeds at any one time 
the program was increased to up to million of net cash proceeds at any one time by a third amendment in may under this agreement  we continuously sell a designated pool of trade accounts receivable to a wholly owned subsidiary  which in turn sells an ownership interest in the receivables to a conduit  administered by an unaffiliated financial institution 
this wholly owned subsidiary is a separate bankruptcy remote entity and its assets would be available first to satisfy the claims of the conduit 
as the receivables sold are collected  we are able to sell additional receivables up to the maximum permitted amount under the program 
the securitization program requires compliance with several financial covenants including an interest coverage ratio and debt to ebitda ratio  as defined in the securitization agreements  as amended 
we were in compliance with the respective covenants at august  the securitization agreements  as amended  expire in february and may be extended on an annual basis 
for each pool of eligible receivables sold to the conduit  we retain a percentage interest in the face value of the receivables  which is calculated based on the terms of the agreement 
net receivables sold under this program are excluded from accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheet and are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows 
we continue to service  administer and collect the receivables sold under this program 
we pay facility fees of per annum of the average purchase limit and program fees of up to of outstanding amounts 
the investors and the securitization conduit have no recourse to the company s assets for failure of debtors to pay when due 
as of august   we had sold million of eligible accounts receivable  which represents the face amount of total outstanding receivables at that date 
in exchange  we received cash proceeds of million and retained an interest in the receivables of approximately million 
in connection with the securitization program  we recognized pretax losses on the sale of receivables of approximately million and million during the fiscal year ended august  and  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we negotiated a two year  thousand credit facility for a ukrainian subsidiary with a ukrainian bank 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  this credit facility was increased to thousand 
however  thousand of our availability under the facility has been restricted for specific purposes 
under the terms of the facility  we pay interest on outstanding borrowings based on libor plus a spread of 
we also pay a commitment fee of per annum for any capacity that is restricted but not outstanding under the facility 
the credit facility expires on june  and any outstanding borrowings are then due and payable 
at august   there was thousand outstanding under this facility 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  we negotiated a five year  million indian rupee approximately million based on currency exchange rates at august  construction loan for an indian subsidiary with an indian bank 
under the terms of the loan facility  we pay interest on 
table of contents outstanding borrowings based on a fixed rate of 
the construction loan expires on april  and all outstanding borrowings are then due and payable 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  we negotiated a five year  million euro construction loan for a hungarian subsidiary with a hungarian bank 
under the terms of the loan facility  we pay interest on outstanding borrowings based on the euro interbank offered rate plus a spread of 
quarterly principal repayments begin in september to repay the amount of proceeds drawn under the construction loan 
the construction loan expires on april  at august   proceeds of million euros approximately million based on currency exchange rates at august  had been drawn under the construction loan 
at august   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash  cash equivalents  available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and our accounts receivable securitization program 
our working capital requirements and capital expenditures could continue to increase in order to support future expansions of our operations through construction of greenfield operations or acquisitions 
it is possible that future expansions may be significant and may require the payment of cash 
future liquidity needs will also depend on fluctuations in levels of inventory and shipments  changes in customer order volumes and timing of expenditures for new equipment 
we currently anticipate that during the next twelve months  our capital expenditures will be in the range of million to million  principally for machinery and equipment  and expansion in china and eastern europe 
we also currently anticipate the need for an additional minimum of million  subject to current negotiations  plus any additional potential earn out consideration for the exercise of the purchase option discussed in note business acquisitions and other transactions and note subsequent event to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that our level of resources  which include cash on hand  available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities  additional proceeds available under our accounts receivable securitization program and funds provided by operations  will be adequate to fund these capital expenditures and our working capital requirements for the next twelve months 
should we desire to consummate significant additional acquisition opportunities or undertake significant additional expansion activities  our capital needs would increase and could possibly result in our need to increase available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities or access public or private debt and equity markets 
there can be no assurance  however  that we would be successful in raising additional debt or equity on terms that we would consider acceptable 
our contractual obligations for short and long term debt arrangements and future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating lease arrangements as of august  are summarized below 
we do not participate in  or secure financing for any unconsolidated limited purpose entities 
we generally do not enter into non cancelable purchase orders for materials until we receive a corresponding purchase commitment from our customer 
non cancelable purchase orders do not typically extend beyond the normal lead time of several weeks at most 
purchase orders beyond this time frame are typically cancelable 
payments due by period in thousands less than after contractual obligations total year years years years notes payable  long term debt and long term lease obligations operating lease obligations total 
table of contents risk factors as referenced  this annual report on form k includes certain forward looking statements regarding various matters 
the ultimate correctness of those forward looking statements is dependent upon a number of known and unknown risks and events  and is subject to various uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results  performance or achievements to be different from those expressed or implied by those statements 
undue reliance should not be placed on those forward looking statements 
the following important factors  among others  as well as those factors set forth in our other sec filings from time to time  could affect future results and events  causing results and events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward looking statements 
our operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our annual and quarterly operating results are affected by a number of factors  including adverse changes in general economic conditions  the level and timing of customer orders  the level of capacity utilization of our manufacturing facilities and associated fixed costs  the composition of the costs of revenue between materials  labor and manufacturing overhead  price competition  our level of experience in manufacturing a particular product  the degree of automation used in our assembly process  the efficiencies achieved in managing inventories and fixed assets  fluctuations in materials costs and availability of materials  seasonality in customers product requirements  and the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales  customer product delivery requirements and shortages of components or labor 
the volume and timing of orders placed by our customers vary due to variation in demand for our customers products  our customers attempts to manage their inventory  electronic design changes  changes in our customers manufacturing strategies  and acquisitions of or consolidations among our customers 
in the past  changes in customer orders have had a significant effect on our results of operations due to corresponding changes in the level of our overhead absorption 
any one or a combination of these factors could adversely affect our annual and quarterly results of operations in the future 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations quarterly results 
because we depend on a limited number of customers  a reduction in sales to any one of our customers could cause a significant decline in our revenue 
for the fiscal year ended august   our five largest customers accounted for approximately of our net revenue and customers accounted for approximately of our net revenue 
for the fiscal year ended august   philips  nokia and hp accounted for approximately  and of our net revenue  respectively 
we expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue and upon their growth  viability and financial stability 
our customers industries have experienced rapid technological change  shortening of product life cycles  consolidation  and pricing and margin pressures 
consolidation among our customers may further reduce the number of customers that generate a significant percentage of our revenues and exposes us to increased risks relating to dependence on a small number of customers 
a significant reduction in sales to any of our customers or a customer exerting significant pricing and margin pressures on us would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in the past  some of our customers have terminated 
table of contents their manufacturing arrangements with us or have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of design  production  product management or repair services ordered from us 
our industry s revenue declined in mid as a result of significant cut backs in customer production requirements  which was consistent with the overall global economic downturn 
we cannot assure you that present or future customers will not terminate their design  production  product management and repair services arrangements with us or significantly change  reduce or delay the amount of services ordered from us 
if they do  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  we generate significant account receivables in connection with providing design  production  product management and repair services to our customers 
if one or more of our customers were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for the services provided by us  our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business customers and marketing 
consolidation in industries that utilize electronics components may adversely affect our business 
in the current economic climate  consolidation in industries that utilize electronics components may further increase as companies combine to achieve further economies of scale and other synergies 
consolidation in industries that utilize electronics components could result in an increase in excess manufacturing capacity as companies seek to divest manufacturing operations or eliminate duplicative product lines 
excess manufacturing capacity has increased  and may continue to increase  pricing and competitive pressures for our industry as a whole and for us in particular 
consolidation could also result in an increasing number of very large companies offering products in multiple industries 
the significant purchasing power and market power of these large companies could increase pricing and competitive pressures for us 
if one of our customers is acquired by another company that does not rely on us to provide services and has its own production facilities or relies on another provider of similar services  we may lose that customer s business 
such consolidation among our customers may further reduce the number of customers that generate a significant percentage of our revenues and exposes us to increased risks relating to dependence on a small number of customers 
any of the foregoing results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business 
our customers may be adversely affected by rapid technological change 
our customers compete in markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and continuous improvements in products and services 
these conditions frequently result in short product life cycles 
our success will depend largely on the success achieved by our customers in developing and marketing their products 
if technologies or standards supported by our customers products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance  our business could be materially adversely affected 
we depend on industries that utilize electronics components  which continually produces technologically advanced products with short life cycles  our inability to continually manufacture such products on a cost effective basis would harm our business 
factors affecting the industries that utilize electronics components in general could seriously harm our customers and  as a result  us 
these factors include the inability of our customers to adapt to rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards  which result in short product life cycles 
the inability of our customers to develop and market their products  some of which are new and untested  the potential that our customers products may become obsolete or the failure of our customers products to gain widespread commercial acceptance 
recessionary periods in our customers markets 
if any of these factors materialize  our business would suffer 

table of contents in addition  if we are unable to offer technologically advanced  cost effective  quick response manufacturing services to customers  demand for our services will also decline 
a substantial portion of our net revenue is derived from our offering of complete service solutions for our customers 
for example  if we fail to maintain high quality design and engineering services  our net revenue may significantly decline 
most of our customers do not commit to long term production schedules  which makes it difficult for us to schedule production and achieve maximum efficiency of our manufacturing capacity 
the volume and timing of sales to our customers may vary due to variation in demand for our customers products  our customers attempts to manage their inventory  electronic design changes  changes in our customers manufacturing strategy  and acquisitions of or consolidations among customers 
due in part to these factors  most of our customers do not commit to firm production schedules for more than one quarter in advance 
our inability to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity 
in the past  we have been required to increase staffing and other expenses in order to meet the anticipated demand of our customers 
anticipated orders from many of our customers have  in the past  failed to materialize or delivery schedules have been deferred as a result of changes in our customers business needs  thereby adversely affecting our results of operations 
on other occasions  our customers have required rapid increases in production  which have placed an excessive burden on our resources 
such customer order fluctuations and deferrals have had a material adverse effect on us in the past  and we may experience such effects in the future 
a business downturn resulting from any of these external factors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business backlog 
our customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities or delay production 
our industry must provide increasingly rapid product turnaround for its customers 
we generally do not obtain firm  long term purchase commitments from our customers and we continue to experience reduced lead times in customer orders 
customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities or delay production for a number of reasons 
the success of our customers products in the market affects our business 
cancellations  reductions or delay by a significant customer or by a group of customers could negatively impact our operating results 
in addition  we make significant decisions  including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept  production schedules  component procurement commitments  personnel needs and other resource requirements  based on our estimate of customer requirements 
the short term nature of our customers commitments and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products reduces our ability to accurately estimate the future requirements of those customers 
on occasion  customers may require rapid increases in production  which can stress our resources and reduce operating margins 
in addition  because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed  a reduction in customer demand can harm our gross profits and operating results 
we compete with numerous other electronic manufacturing services and design providers and others  including our current and potential customers who may decide to manufacture all of their products internally 
our business is highly competitive 
we compete against numerous domestic and foreign electronic manufacturing services and design providers  including celestica  inc  flextronics international  hon hai 
table of contents precision industry co  ltd  sanmina sci corporation and solectron corporation 
in addition  we may in the future encounter competition from other large electronic manufacturers and manufacturers that are focused solely on design and manufacturing services  that are selling  or may begin to sell the same services 
most of our competitors have international operations  significant financial resources and some have substantially greater manufacturing  r d  and marketing resources than us 
these competitors may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies  have greater name recognition  critical mass and geographic market presence  be better able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities  adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements  devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their services  and be better positioned to compete on price for their services 
we also face competition from the manufacturing operations of our current and potential customers  who are continually evaluating the merits of manufacturing products internally against the advantages of outsourcing 
see business competition 
increased competition may result in decreased demand or prices for our services 
because our industry is highly competitive  we compete against numerous us and foreign electronic manufacturing service providers with global operations  as well as those who operate on a local or regional basis 
in addition  current and prospective customers continually evaluate the merits of manufacturing products internally 
some of our competitors have substantially greater managerial  manufacturing  engineering  technical  systems  r d  sales and marketing resources than we do 
consolidation in our industry results in larger and more geographically diverse competitors who have significant combined resources with which to compete against us 
we may be operating at a cost disadvantage compared to competitors who have greater direct buying power from component suppliers  distributors and raw material suppliers or who have lower cost structures as a result of their geographic location or the services they provide 
as a result  competitors may procure a competitive advantage and obtain business from our customers 
our manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection 
in addition  companies with greater resources or a greater market presence may enter our market or increase their competition with us 
we also expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products or services  to reduce their current products or service sales prices and to introduce new products or services that may offer greater performance and improved pricing 
any of these could cause a decline in sales  loss of market acceptance of our products or services  profit margin compression  or loss of market share 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our international operations  which may be subject to a number of risks and often require more management time and expense to achieve profitability than our domestic operations 
we derived of revenues from international operations in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year we expect our revenues from international operations to increase as a percentage of total net revenue due to expansion in china  eastern europe and india  and due to the continued shift of production to lower cost regions 
we currently operate outside the united states in vienna  austria  bruges and hasselt  belgium  belo horizonte  manaus and sao paulo  brazil  hong kong  huangpu  panyu  shanghai  shenzhen  and wuxi  china  coventry  england  brest and meung sur loire  france  szombathely and tiszaujvaros  hungary  pune and ranjangaon  india  dublin  ireland  bergamo and marcianise  italy  gotemba  japan  penang  malaysia  chihuahua  guadalajara and reynosa  mexico  amsterdam  the netherlands  kwidzyn  poland  ayr and livingston  scotland  singapore city  singapore  hsinchu  taiwan  and uzhgorod  ukraine 
we continually consider additional opportunities to make 
table of contents foreign acquisitions and construct new foreign facilities 
our international operations may be subject to a number of risks  including difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  political and economic instability  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and laws  longer customer payment cycles and difficulty collecting accounts receivable export duties  import controls and trade barriers including quotas  governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to us from our operations outside the united states  burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and labor practices  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  which could affect local payroll  utility and other expenses  and inability to utilize net operating losses incurred by our foreign operations against future income in the same jurisdiction 
in addition  several of the countries where we operate have emerging or developing economies  which may be subject to greater currency volatility  negative growth  high inflation  limited availability of foreign exchange and other risks 
these factors may harm our results of operations  and any measures that we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies and other risks of our international operations may not be effective 
in our experience  entry into new international markets requires considerable management time as well as start up expenses for market development  hiring and establishing office facilities before any significant revenues are generated 
as a result  initial operations in a new market may operate at low margins or may be unprofitable 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
if we do not manage our growth effectively  our profitability could decline 
we have grown rapidly 
our ability to manage growth effectively will require us to continue to implement and improve our operational  financial and management information systems  continue to develop the management skills of our managers and supervisors  and continue to train  motivate and manage our employees 
our failure to effectively manage growth could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
see selected consolidated financial data and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we may not achieve expected profitability from our acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate the operations and management of our recent acquisitions 
similarly  we cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate or  if consummated  successfully integrate the operations and management of future acquisitions 
acquisitions involve significant risks  which could have a material adverse effect on us  including financial risks  such as potential liabilities of the acquired businesses  costs associated with integrating acquired operations and businesses  the dilutive effect of the issuance of additional equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  the financial impact of valuing goodwill and other intangible assets involved in any acquisitions  potential future impairment write downs of goodwill and the amortization of other intangible assets  possible adverse tax and accounting effects  and the risk that we spend substantial amounts purchasing these manufacturing facilities and assume significant contractual and other obligations with no guaranteed levels of revenue or that we may have to close facilities at our cost 

table of contents operating risks  such as the diversion of management s attention to the assimilation of the businesses to be acquired  the risk that the acquired businesses will fail to maintain the quality of services that we have historically provided  the need to implement financial and other systems and add management resources  the risk that key employees of the acquired businesses will leave after the acquisition  unforeseen difficulties in the acquired operations  and the impact on us of any unionized work force we may acquire or any labor disruptions that might occur 
we have acquired and will continue to pursue the acquisition of manufacturing and supply chain management operations 
in these acquisitions  the divesting company will typically enter into a supply arrangement with the acquiror 
therefore  the competition for these acquisitions is intense 
in addition  certain divesting companies may choose not to consummate these acquisitions with us because of our current supply arrangements with other companies 
if we are unable to attract and consummate some of these acquisition opportunities  our growth could be adversely impacted 
arrangements entered into with divesting companies typically involve many risks  including the following the integration into our business of the acquired assets and facilities may be time consuming and costly 
we  rather than the divesting company  may bear the risk of excess capacity 
we may not achieve anticipated cost reductions and efficiencies 
we may be unable to meet the expectations of the divesting company as to volume  product quality  timeliness and cost reductions 
if demand for the divesting company s products declines  it may reduce the volume of purchases and we may not be able to sufficiently reduce the expenses of operating the facility or use the facility to provide services to other customers 
as a result of these and other risks  we may be unable to achieve anticipated levels of profitability under these arrangements  and they may not result in any material revenues or contribute positively to our earnings 
our ability to achieve the expected benefits of the outsourcing opportunities associated with these acquisitions is subject to risks  including our ability to meet volume  product quality  timeliness and pricing requirements  and our ability to achieve the divesting company s expected cost reduction 
in addition  when acquiring manufacturing operations  we may receive limited commitments to firm production schedules 
accordingly  in these circumstances  we may spend substantial amounts purchasing these manufacturing facilities and assume significant contractual and other obligations with no guaranteed levels of revenues 
we may also not achieve expected profitability from these arrangements 
as a result of these and other risks  these outsourcing opportunities may not be profitable 
we face risks arising from the restructuring of our operations 
over the past few years  we have undertaken initiatives to restructure our business operations with the intention of improving utilization and realizing cost savings in the future 
these initiatives have included changing the number and location of our production facilities  largely to align our capacity and infrastructure with current and anticipated customer demand 
this alignment includes transferring programs from higher cost geographies to lower cost geographies 
the process of restructuring entails  among other activities  moving production between facilities  reducing staff levels  realigning our business processes and reorganizing our management 
we continue to evaluate our operations and may need to undertake additional restructuring initiatives in the future 
if we incur additional restructuring related charges  our financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

table of contents we depend on a limited number of suppliers for components that are critical to our manufacturing processes 
a shortage of these components or an increase in their price could interrupt our operations and reduce our profits 
substantially all of our net revenue is derived from turnkey manufacturing in which we provide materials procurement 
while most of our significant long term customer contracts permit quarterly or other periodic adjustments to pricing based on decreases and increases in component prices and other factors  we may bear the risk of component price increases that occur between any such re pricings or  if such re pricing is not permitted  during the balance of the term of the particular customer contract 
accordingly  certain component price increases could adversely affect our gross profit margins 
almost all of the products we manufacture require one or more components that are available from only a single source 
some of these components are allocated from time to time in response to supply shortages 
in some cases  supply shortages will substantially curtail production of all assemblies using a particular component 
in addition  at various times industry wide shortages of electronic components have occurred  particularly of memory and logic devices 
such circumstances have produced insignificant levels of short term interruption of our operations  but could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the future 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business components procurement 
we may not be able to maintain our engineering  technological and manufacturing process expertise 
the markets for our manufacturing and engineering services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process development 
the continued success of our business will depend upon our ability to hire  retain and expand our qualified engineering and technical personnel  maintain technological leadership  develop and market manufacturing services that meet changing customer needs  and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost effective and timely basis 
although we believe that our operations use the assembly and testing technologies  equipment and processes that are currently required by our customers  we cannot be certain that we will develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future 
the emergence of new technology  industry standards or customer requirements may render our equipment  inventory or processes obsolete or noncompetitive 
in addition  we may have to acquire new assembly and testing technologies and equipment to remain competitive 
the acquisition and implementation of new technologies and equipment may require significant expense or capital investment  which could reduce our operating margins and our operating results 
in facilities that we establish or acquire  we may not be able to maintain our engineering  technological and manufacturing process expertise 
our failure to anticipate and adapt to our customers changing technological needs and requirements or to maintain our engineering  technological and manufacturing expertise  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we manufacture products containing design or manufacturing defects  or if our manufacturing processes do not comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements  demand for our services may decline and we may be subject to liability claims 
we manufacture and design products to our customers specifications  and  in some cases  our manufacturing processes and facilities may need to comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements 
for example  medical devices that we manufacture or design  as well as the facilities and manufacturing processes that we use to produce them  are regulated by the food and drug administration and non us counterparts of this agency 
similarly  items we manufacture for customers in the defense and aerospace industries  as well as the processes we use to produce them  are regulated by the department of defense and the federal aviation authority 
in addition  our customers products and the manufacturing 
table of contents processes that we use to produce them often are highly complex 
as a result  products that we manufacture may at times contain manufacturing or design defects  and our manufacturing processes may be subject to errors or not be in compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements 
defects in the products we manufacture or design  whether caused by a design  manufacturing or component failure or error  or deficiencies in our manufacturing processes  may result in delayed shipments to customers or reduced or cancelled customer orders 
if these defects or deficiencies are significant  our business reputation may also be damaged 
the failure of the products that we manufacture or our manufacturing processes and facilities to comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements may subject us to legal fines or penalties and  in some cases  require us to shut down or incur considerable expense to correct a manufacturing process or facility 
in addition  these defects may result in liability claims against us or expose us to liability to pay for the recall of a product 
the magnitude of such claims may increase as we expand our medical  automotive  and aerospace and defense manufacturing services  as defects in medical devices  automotive components  and aerospace and defense systems could seriously harm or kill users of these products and others 
even if our customers are responsible for the defects  they may not  or may not have resources to  assume responsibility for any costs or liabilities arising from these defects 
our increasing design services offerings may result in additional exposure to product liability  intellectual property infringement and other claims 
we have increased our efforts to offer certain design services  primarily those relating to products that we manufacture for our customers  and we now offer design services related to collaborative design manufacturing and turnkey solutions 
providing such services can expose us to different or greater potential liabilities than those we face when providing our regular manufacturing services 
with the growth of our design services business  we have increased exposure to potential product liability claims resulting from injuries caused by defects in products we design  as well as potential claims that products we design infringe third party intellectual property rights 
such claims could subject us to significant liability for damages and  regardless of their merits  could be time consuming and expensive to resolve 
we also may have greater potential exposure from warranty claims  and from product recalls due to problems caused by product design 
costs associated with possible product liability claims  intellectual property infringement claims  and product recalls could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
when providing collaborative design manufacturing or turnkey solutions  we may not be guaranteed revenues needed to recoup or profit from the investment in the resources necessary to design and develop products 
particularly  no revenue may be generated from these efforts if our customers do not approve the designs in a timely manner or at all  or if they do not then purchase anticipated levels of products 
furthermore  contracts may allow the customer to delay or cancel deliveries and may not obligate the customer to any volume of purchases  or may provide for penalties or cancellation of orders if we are late in delivering designs or products 
we may even have the responsibility to ensure that products we design satisfy safety and regulatory standards and to obtain any necessary certifications 
failure to timely obtain the necessary approvals or certifications could prevent us from selling these products  which in turn could harm our sales  profitability and reputation 
the success of our turnkey activity depends in part on our ability to obtain  protect  and leverage intellectual property rights to our designs 
we strive to obtain and protect certain intellectual property rights to our turnkey solutions designs 
we believe that having a significant level of protected proprietary technology gives us a competitive advantage in marketing our services 
however  we cannot be certain that the measures that we employ will result in protected intellectual property rights or will result in the prevention of unauthorized use of our technology 
if we are unable to obtain and protect intellectual property rights embodied within our designs  this could reduce or eliminate the competitive advantages of our proprietary technology  which would harm our business 

table of contents intellectual property infringement claims against our customers or us could harm our business 
our turnkey solutions products may compete against the products of other companies  many of whom may own the intellectual property rights underlying those products 
as a result  we could become subject to claims of intellectual property infringement 
additionally  customers for our turnkey solutions services typically require that we indemnify them against the risk of intellectual property infringement 
if any claims are brought against us or against our customers for such infringement  whether or not these claims have merit  we could be required to expend significant resources in defense of such claims 
in the event of such an infringement claim  we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop non infringing alternatives or obtain licenses 
we may not be successful in developing such alternatives or obtaining such a license on reasonable terms or at all 
if our turnkey solutions products are subject to design defects  our business may be damaged and we may incur significant fees 
in our contracts with turnkey solutions customers  we generally provide them with a warranty against defects in our designs 
if a turnkey solutions product or component that we design is found to be defective in its design  this may lead to increased warranty claims 
although we have product liability insurance coverage  it may not be available on acceptable terms  in sufficient amounts  or at all 
a successful product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage or any material claim for which insurance coverage was denied or limited and for which indemnification was not available could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we depend on our officers  managers and skilled personnel 
our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our executive officers 
generally our employees are not bound by employment or non competition agreements  and we cannot assure you that we will retain our executive officers and other key employees 
we could be seriously harmed by the loss of any of our executive officers 
in order to manage our growth  we will need to recruit and retain additional skilled management personnel and if we are not able to do so  our business and our ability to continue to grow could be harmed 
in addition  in connection with expanding our turnkey solutions activities  we must attract and retain experienced design engineers 
competition for highly skilled employees is substantial 
our failure to recruit and retain experienced design engineers could limit the growth of our turnkey solutions activities  which could adversely affect our business 
any delay in the implementation of our information systems could disrupt our operations and cause unanticipated increases in our costs 
we have completed the installation of an enterprise resource planning system in most of our manufacturing sites and in our corporate location 
we are in the process of installing this system in certain of our remaining plants  which will replace the current manufacturing resource planning system  and financial information systems 
any delay in the implementation of these information systems could result in material adverse consequences  including disruption of operations  loss of information and unanticipated increases in cost 
compliance or the failure to comply with current and future environmental regulations could cause us significant expense 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state  local and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process or requiring design changes or recycling of products we manufacture 
if we fail to comply with any present and future regulations  we could be subject to future liabilities  the suspension of production or a prohibition on the sale of products we manufacture 
in addition  such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment  or to incur other significant 
table of contents expenses to comply with environmental regulations  including expenses associated with the recall of any non compliant product 
from time to time new regulations are enacted  and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations will be implemented and enforced 
we continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted 
for example  in the european union enacted the restriction on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment directive rohs and the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive weee  for implementation in european union member states 
rohs and weee regulate the use of certain hazardous substances in  and require the collection  reuse and recycling of waste from certain products we manufacture 
we are aware of similar legislation that is currently in force or is being considered in the united states  as well as other countries  such as japan and china 
rohs and weee are in the process of being implemented by individual countries in the european union 
it is likely that each jurisdiction will interpret rohs and weee differently as they each implement them 
we will continue to monitor rohs and weee guidance as it is announced by individual jurisdictions to determine our responsibilities 
the incomplete guidance available to us to date suggests that in many instances we will not be directly responsible for compliance with rohs and weee  but that such regulations will likely apply directly to our customers 
however  because we manufacture the products and may provide design and or compliance related services for our customers  we may at times become contractually or directly subject to such regulations 
also  final guidance from individual jurisdictions may impose different or additional responsibilities upon us 
our failure to comply with any of such regulatory requirements or contractual obligations could result in our being directly or indirectly liable for costs  fines or penalties and third party claims  and could jeopardize our ability to conduct business in countries in the european union 
certain of our existing stockholders have significant control 
at august   our executive officers  directors and certain of their family members collectively beneficially owned of our outstanding common stock  of which william d 
morean  our chairman of the board  beneficially owned 
as a result  our executive officers  directors and certain of their family members have significant influence over the election of our board of directors  the approval or disapproval of any other matters requiring stockholder approval  and the affairs and policies of jabil 
we are subject to the risk of increased taxes 
we base our tax position upon the anticipated nature and conduct of our business and upon our understanding of the tax laws of the various countries in which we have assets or conduct activities 
our tax position  however  is subject to review and possible challenge by taxing authorities and to possible changes in law 
we cannot determine in advance the extent to which some jurisdictions may assess additional tax or interest and penalties on such additional taxes 
several countries in which we are located allow for tax holidays or provide other tax incentives to attract and retain business 
we have obtained holidays or other incentives where available and practicable 
our taxes could increase if certain tax holidays or incentives are retracted  or if they are not renewed upon expiration  or tax rates applicable to us in such jurisdictions are otherwise increased 
in addition  further acquisitions may cause our effective tax rate to increase 
our credit rating is subject to change 
our credit is rated by credit rating agencies 
for example  our senior notes are rated bbb by fitch ratings  baa by moody s investor service  and bbb by standard and poor s rating service  which are all considered investment grade debt 
if in the future our credit rating is downgraded so that none of the credit rating agencies rate our senior notes as investment grade debt  such a downgrade may increase our cost of capital should we borrow under our revolving credit facilities 

table of contents additionally  a downgrade of our credit rating with one or more of the credit rating agencies may make it more expensive for us to raise additional capital in the future on terms that are acceptable to us or at all  may negatively impact the price of our common stock  and may have other negative implications on our business  many of which are beyond our control 
we are subject to risks of currency fluctuations and related hedging operations 
a portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
changes in exchange rates among other currencies and the us dollar will affect our cost of sales  operating margins and revenues 
we cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations 
we use financial instruments  primarily forward purchase contracts  to hedge us dollar and other currency commitments arising from trade accounts receivable  trade accounts payable and fixed purchase obligations 
if these hedging activities are not successful or we change or reduce these hedging activities in the future  we may experience significant unexpected expenses from fluctuations in exchange rates 
we could incur a significant amount of debt in the future 
we currently have the ability to borrow up to million under our unsecured revolver 
in addition  we could incur additional indebtedness in the future in the form of bank loans  notes or convertible securities 
an increase in the level of our indebtedness  among other things  could make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary financing in the future for other acquisitions  working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to changes in  our business  and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet future debt service obligations 
an adverse change in the interest rates for our borrowings could adversely affect our financial condition 
we pay interest on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and other long term debt obligations at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base interest rates 
an adverse change in the base rates upon which our interest rates are determined could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we are exposed to intangible asset risk 
we have recorded intangible assets  including goodwill  in connection with business acquisitions 
we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests at least on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows 
as a result of our annual and other periodic evaluations  we may determine that the intangible asset values need to be written down to their fair values  which could result in material charges that could be adverse to our operating results and financial position 
customer relationships with emerging companies may present more risks than with established companies 
customer relationships with emerging companies present special risks because such companies do not have an extensive product history 
as a result  there is less demonstration of market acceptance of their products making it harder for us to anticipate needs and requirements than with established customers 
in addition  due to the current economic environment  additional funding for such companies may be more difficult to obtain and these customer relationships may not continue or materialize to the extent we planned or we previously experienced 
this tightening of financing for start up customers  together with many start up customers lack of prior earnings and unproven product markets increase our credit risk  especially in accounts receivable and inventories 
although we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our 
table of contents customers and adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for all customers  including start up customers  based on the information available  these allowances may not be adequate 
this risk exists for any new emerging company customers in the future 
our stock price may be volatile 
our common stock is traded on the new york stock exchange 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and could fluctuate substantially in the future  based on a variety of factors  including future announcements covering us or our key customers or competitors  government regulations  litigation  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  fluctuations in quarterly operating results  or general conditions in our industry and the aerospace  automotive  computing  consumer  defense  instrumentation  medical  networking  peripherals  storage and telecommunications industries 
furthermore  stock prices for many companies  and high technology companies in particular  fluctuate widely for reasons that may be unrelated to their operating results 
those fluctuations and general economic  political and market conditions  such as recessions or international currency fluctuations and demand for our services  may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
provisions in our charter documents and state law may make it harder for others to obtain control of us even though some shareholders might consider such a development to be favorable 
our shareholder rights plan  provisions of our amended certificate of incorporation and the delaware corporation laws may delay  inhibit or prevent someone from gaining control of us through a tender offer  business combination  proxy contest or some other method 
these provisions include a poison pill shareholder rights plan  a statutory restriction on the ability of shareholders to take action by less than unanimous written consent  and a statutory restriction on business combinations with some types of interested shareholders 
recently enacted changes in the securities laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of that became law in july has required changes in some of our corporate governance  securities disclosure and compliance practices 
in response to the requirements of that act  the securities and exchange commission and the new york stock exchange have promulgated new rules on a variety of subjects 
compliance with these new rules has increased our legal and financial and accounting costs  and we expect these increased costs to continue indefinitely 
we also expect these developments to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
likewise  these developments may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors or qualified executive officers 
due to inherent limitations  there can be no assurance that our system of disclosure and internal controls and procedures will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud  or in informing management of all material information in timely manner 
our management  including our ceo and cfo  does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
further  the design of a control system reflects that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within the company have been detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur simply because of 
table of contents error or mistake 
additionally  controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by management override of the control 
the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions  over time  a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 
if we receive other than an unqualified opinion on the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting as of august  and future year ends as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which could result in a decrease in the value of your shares 
as directed by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  the securities and exchange commission adopted rules requiring public companies to include an annual report on internal control over financial reporting reports on form k that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
in addition  the public accounting firm auditing the company s financial statements must attest to and report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
while we continuously conduct a rigorous review of our internal control over financial reporting in order to assure compliance with the section requirements  if our independent auditors interpret the section requirements and the related rules and regulations differently from us or if our independent auditors are not satisfied with our internal control over financial reporting or with the level at which it is documented  operated or reviewed  they may decline to attest to management s assessment or issue a qualified report 
a qualified opinion could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements 
there are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates  judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap 
any changes in estimates  judgments and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
the consolidated and condensed consolidated financial statements included in the periodic reports we file with the securities and exchange commission are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap involves making estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets including intangible assets  liabilities and related reserves  revenues  expenses and income 
estimates  judgments and assumptions are inherently subject to change in the future  and any such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and income 
any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
changes to financial accounting standards may affect our reported results of operations and could result in a decrease in the value of your shares 
there has been an ongoing public debate as to whether employee stock option and employee stock purchase plan shares should be treated as a compensation expense and  if so  how to properly value such charges 
in december  the financial accounting standards board published amendments to financial accounting standards that will require that awards under such plans be treated as compensation expense using the fair value method 
this amendment will be effective for our first quarter of fiscal year management has assessed the implications of this revised standard  which will materially impact the company s results of operations in the first quarter of fiscal year and thereafter

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risks we transact business in various foreign countries and are  therefore  subject to risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we enter into forward contracts to hedge transactional exposure associated with commitments arising from trade accounts receivable  trade accounts payable and fixed purchase obligations denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective operating entity 
all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their respective fair market values in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas 
the aggregate notional amount of outstanding contracts at august  was million 
the fair value of these contracts amounted to million and was recorded as a net liability on the condensed consolidated balance sheet

interest rate risk a portion of our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions 
we protect our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by generally investing in investment grade securities and by frequently positioning the portfolio to try to respond appropriately to a reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer  guarantor or depository to levels below the credit ratings dictated by our investment policy 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
at august   the outstanding amount in the investment portfolio was million  comprised mainly of money market funds with an average return of 
we have issued our senior notes with a principal maturity of million due in july the senior notes bear a fixed interest rate of  which is payable semiannually on january and july we entered into an interest rate swap transaction to effectively convert the fixed interest rate of the senior notes to a variable rate 
the swap  which was originally to expire in  was accounted for as a fair value hedge under sfas the notional amount of the swap was million 
under the terms of the swap  we paid an interest rate equal to the six month libor rate  set in arrears  plus a fixed spread of 
in exchange  we received a payment based on a fixed rate of 
the interest rate swap was terminated on june  for the periods subsequent to the termination date  interest on the senior notes will not fluctuate based on changes in the base interest rate 
therefore our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates related to the senior notes has been eliminated 
we pay interest on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facilities at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base interest rates 
these facilities include our unsecured revolver  our billion japanese yen credit facility and our thousand ukrainian credit facility 
there was million outstanding under these revolving credit facilities at august  we pay interest on outstanding borrowings under our million euro loan agreement for a hungarian subsidiary at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base interest rates 
there was million euros approximately million based on currency exchange rates at august  outstanding under this loan agreement at august  
table of contents see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and risk factors we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our international operations  which may be subject to a number of risks and often require more management time and expense to achieve profitability than our domestic operations  and an adverse change in the interest rates for our borrowings could adversely affect our financial condition
