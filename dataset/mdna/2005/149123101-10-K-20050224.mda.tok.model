information required by item is incorporated by reference from pages a through a of the appendix 
safe harbor statement under the securities litigation reform act of certain statements contained in our management s discussion and analysis are forward looking and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results 
the words believes  expects  estimates  anticipates  will be  should and similar words or expressions identify forward looking statements made on behalf of caterpillar 
uncertainties include factors that affect international businesses  as well as matters specific to the company and the markets it serves 
world economic factors the world economy had its best recovery in years in and we expect that recovery to continue  but at a somewhat slower pace  in that outlook assumes central banks will cautiously raise interest rates so as not to slow growth too much 
low interest rates  and continued good economic growth  should encourage further growth in construction and mining 
should central banks raise interest rates aggressively  both the world economic recovery and our machinery and engines sales likely would be weaker 
the us economy is growing at more than a three percent rate  which up to now has not created an inflation problem 
while the federal reserve has raised interest rates  we assume the continuation of moderate growth and low inflation will result in interest rates of no more than percent by the end of long term interest rates are expected to rise less than short term rates 
that environment should support further growth in construction and manufacturing  helping to keep commodity prices favorable 
should financial conditions tighten noticeably  causing economic growth to slow below percent  expected improvements in machinery and engines sales likely would be lower than projected 
our projection of increased sales of machinery and engines in europe  africa  middle east eame assumes that low interest rates will allow slightly faster economic growth in europe and that favorable commodity prices will extend healthy recoveries in both africa and middle east ame and the cis 
key risks are that the european central bank will raise interest rates sharply to reduce inflation or that commodity prices collapse 
those developments would negatively impact our results 
favorable commodity prices  increased capital inflows and an improved foreign debt situation are expected to contribute to another year of economic recovery in latin america 
as a result  we project that both mining production and construction spending will increase  supporting an increase in machinery and engines sales 
this forecast is vulnerable to a significant weakening in commodity prices  a slowing in world economic growth or widespread increases in interest rates 
in asia pacific  we project sales growth in australia  india and the developing asian economies will offset a further decline in china 
critical assumptions are continued growth in coal demand  low domestic interest rates in most countries  further gains in exports and continued good economic growth in china 
some developments that could lower expected results include reduced demand for thermal and coking coal  significant revaluations of regional currencies  restrictions on regional exports and sharp interest rate hikes  particularly in china 
commodity prices commodities represent a significant sales opportunity  with prices and production as key drivers 
prices have improved sharply over the past year and a half and our outlook assumes continued growth in world industrial production will cause metals prices to remain high enough in to encourage further mine investment 
any unexpected weakening in world industrial production  however  could cause prices to drop sharply to the detriment of our results 
page coal production and prices improved last year and our sales have benefited 
we expect these trends to continue in should coal prices soften  due to a slowing in world economic growth or otherwise  the ongoing sales recovery would be vulnerable 
oil and natural gas prices increased sharply over the past two years due to strong demand and high capacity usage 
higher energy prices did not halt economic recoveries last year since a strong demand boosted prices and world production increased 
high prices are encouraging more exploration and development and we expect increased production in will constrain price increases 
however  should significant supply cuts occur  such as from opec production cuts or political unrest in a major producing country  the resulting oil shortages and price spikes could slow economies  potentially with a depressing impact on our sales 
monetary and fiscal policies for most companies operating in a global economy  monetary and fiscal policies implemented in the united states and abroad could have a significant impact on economic growth  and accordingly  demand for a product 
in general  higher than expected interest rates  reductions in government spending  higher taxes  excessive currency movements  and uncertainty over key policies are some factors likely to lead to slower economic growth and lower industry demand 
with economic data looking more favorable  central banks in developed countries have started raising interest rates from the lowest rates in decades 
our outlook assumes that central banks will take great care to ensure that economic recoveries continue and that interest rates will remain low throughout the forecast period 
should central banks raise interest rates more aggressively than anticipated  both economic growth and our sales could suffer 
budget deficits in many countries have increased  which has limited the ability of governments to boost economies with tax cuts and more spending 
our outlook assumes that governments will not aggressively raise taxes and slash spending to deal with their budget imbalances 
such actions could disrupt growth and negatively affect our sales 
political factors political factors in the united states and abroad can impact global companies 
our outlook assumes that no major disruptive changes in economic policies occur in either the united states or other major economies 
significant changes in either taxing or spending policies could reduce activities in sectors important to our businesses  thereby reducing sales 
our outlook assumes that there will be no additional significant military conflicts in either north korea or the middle east in the forecast period 
such military conflicts could severely disrupt sales into countries affected  as well as nearby countries 
our outlook also assumes that there will be no major terrorist attacks 
if there is a major terrorist attack  confidence could be undermined  potentially causing a sharp drop in economic activities and our sales 
attacks in major developed economies would be the most disruptive 
our outlook assumes that efforts by countries to increase their exports will not result in retaliatory countermeasures by other countries to block such exports  particularly in the asia pacific region 
our outlook includes a negative impact from the phase out of the extraterritorial income exclusion eti as enacted by the american jobs creation act of the act 
however  our outlook does not include any impact from the provision of the act allowing preferential tax treatment of the repatriation of non us earnings in further  our outlook assumes any other tax law changes will not negatively impact our provision for income taxes 
currency fluctuations the company has costs and revenues in many currencies and is therefore exposed to risks arising from currency fluctuations 
our outlook assumes no significant changes in currency values from current rates 
should currency rates change sharply  our results could be negatively impacted 
the company s largest manufacturing presence is in the united states  so any unexpected strengthening of the dollar tends to raise the foreign currency costs to our end users and reduce our global competitiveness 
page dealer practices the company sells primarily through an independent dealer network 
dealers carry inventories of both new and rental equipment and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs 
such adjustments can impact our results either positively or negatively 
the current outlook assumes dealers will increase inventories in line with higher deliveries 
should dealers control inventories more tightly  our sales would be lower 
financial products division factors inherent in the operation of cat financial is the credit risk associated with its customers 
the creditworthiness of each customer  and the rate of delinquencies  repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors  including  but not limited to  relevant industry and economic conditions  the availability of capital  the experience and expertise of the customer s management team  commodity prices  political events  and the sustained value of the underlying collateral 
additionally  interest rate movements create a degree of risk to our operations by affecting the amount of our interest payments and the value of our fixed rate debt 
our match funding policy manages interest rate risk by matching the interest rate profile fixed rate or floating rate of our debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of our receivables portfolio within certain parameters 
to achieve our match funding objectives  we issue debt with similar interest rate profile to our receivables and also use interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate risk exposure to interest rate changes and in some cases to lower our cost of borrowed funds 
if interest rates move upward more sharply than anticipated  our financial results could be negatively impacted 
with respect to our insurance and investment management operations  changes in the equity and bond markets could cause an impairment of the value of our investment portfolio  thus requiring a negative adjustment to earnings 
other factors the rate of infrastructure spending  housing starts  commercial construction and mining plays a significant role in the company s results 
our products are an integral component of these activities and as these activities increase or decrease in the united states or abroad  demand for our products may be significantly impacted 
projected cost savings or synergies from alliances with new partners could also be negatively impacted by a variety of factors 
these factors could include  among other things  higher than expected wages  energy and or material costs  and or higher than expected financing costs due to unforeseen changes in tax  trade  environmental  labor  safety  payroll or pension policies in any of the jurisdictions in which the alliances conduct their operations 
as of december   there were  us hourly production employees who were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions 
the united automobile  aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america uaw represents  caterpillar employees under a six year central labor agreement that will expire march  the international association of machinists iam represents  employees under labor agreements expiring on april   and may  based on our historical experience during periods when labor unrest or work stoppage by union represented employees has occurred  we do not expect that the occurrence of such events  if any  arising in connection with the expiration of these agreements will have a material impact on our operations or results 
results may be impacted positively or negatively by changes in the sales mix 
our outlook assumes a certain geographic mix of sales as well as a product mix of sales 
if actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales  our results could be negatively impacted 
the company operates in a highly competitive environment and our outlook depends on a forecast of the company s share of industry sales 
an unexpected reduction in that share could result from pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors  unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties  a failure to price the product competitively  or an unexpected buildup in competitors new machine or dealer owned rental fleets  leading to severe downward pressure on machine rental rates and or used equipment prices 
page the environment remains competitive from a pricing standpoint 
our sales outlook assumes that the company will be successful in implementing worldwide machine price increases communicated to dealers with an effective date of january  while we expect that the environment will absorb these price actions  delays in the marketplace acceptance would negatively impact our results 
moreover  additional price discounting to maintain our competitive position could result in lower than anticipated price realization 
in general  our results are sensitive to changes in economic growth  particularly those originating in construction  mining and energy 
developments reducing such activities also tend to lower our sales 
in addition to the factors mentioned above  our results could be negatively impacted by any of the following any sudden drop in consumer or business confidence  delays in legislation needed to fund public construction  regulatory or legislative changes that slow activity in key industries  and or unexpected collapses in stock markets 
this discussion of uncertainties is by no means exhaustive  but is designed to highlight important factors that may impact our outlook 
obvious factors such as general economic conditions throughout the world do not warrant further discussion  but are noted to further emphasize the myriad of contingencies that may cause the company s actual results to differ from those currently anticipated
