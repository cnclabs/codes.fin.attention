item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations trends  risks and uncertainties  and elsewhere in this annual report 
part i item business formfactor designs  develops  manufactures  sells and supports precision  high performance advanced semiconductor wafer probe cards 
semiconductor manufacturers use the company s wafer probe cards to perform wafer probe test on the whole wafer in the front end of the semiconductor manufacturing process 
the company introduced its first wafer probe card based on its microspring interconnect technology in the company offers products that are custom designed for semiconductor manufacturers unique wafer designs and enable them to reduce their overall cost of test 
in fiscal  we benefited from semiconductor manufacturers ongoing transition to mm wafer fabrication facilities and to transitions to new chip designs and architectures 
as a result  in fiscal our revenues grew by and our earnings grew by over as compared to fiscal  demonstrating significant operating leverage for the company s business activities 
in fiscal  the company also moved its corporate headquarters to its new campus facility and started the transition of its manufacturing operations 
this transition is ongoing and includes the funding and bring up of a new manufacturing clean room facility 
while this transition has resulted in significant start up costs  in fiscal we were able to fund these costs from our operating cash flows 
products formfactor s products are based on its proprietary technologies  including its microspring interconnect technology and design tools 
the company s microspring interconnect technology  which includes resilient spring like contact elements  enables the company to produce wafer probe cards for applications that require reliability  speed  precision and signal integrity 
formfactor manufactures its microspring contact elements through precision micro machining and scalable semiconductor like wafer fabrication processes 
the company s microspring contacts are springs that optimize the relative amounts of force on  and across  a bond pad during the test process and maintain their shape and position over a range of compression 
these characteristics allow formfactor to achieve reliable  electrical contact on either clean or oxidized surfaces  including bond pads on a wafer 
for many device applications  the microspring contacts enable the company s wafer probe cards to make hundreds of thousands of touchdowns with minimal maintenance 
the 
table of contents microspring contact can be attached to many surfaces  or substrates  including printed circuit boards  silicon wafers  ceramics and various metalized surfaces 
since its original conception  the microspring contact has evolved into a library of spring shapes and technologies 
the company s designers use this library to design an optimized custom wafer probe card for each application 
since developing this fundamental technology  formfactor has broadened and refined it to respond to the increasing demands of smaller  faster and more complex semiconductors 
the company continues to invest in research and development activities around its interconnect technology as the company s microspring contacts have scaled in size with the evolution of semiconductors 
formfactor microspring contacts include geometrically precise tip structures 
these tip structures are the parts of the company s wafer probe cards that come into contact with the chips  and are manufactured using proprietary semiconductor like processes 
these tip structures enable precise contact with small bond pad sizes and pitches 
the company s technology allows it to specifically design the geometries of the contact tip in order to ensure the most precise and predictable electrical contact is achieved for a customer s particular application 
the company s wafer probe cards are custom products that are designed to order for its customers unique wafer designs 
for certain high parallelism test applications  the company s products require large area contact array sizes because they must accommodate over  simultaneous contacts 
this requirement poses fundamental challenges that include the planarity of the array  the force needed to make contact and the need to touch all bond pads with equal accuracy 
formfactor has developed wafer probe cards that use array sizes ranging from mm x mm up to greater than mm x mm  in combination with complex multi layer printed circuit boards designed by the company 
the company s current dram contacting technology allows its products to contact up to dram chips in parallel 
formfactor s current flash contacting technology allows its wafer probe cards to contact up to flash chips in parallel 
the company has invested and intends to continue to invest considerable resources in its wafer probe card design tools and processes 
these tools and processes enable automated routing and trace length adjustment within the company s printed circuit boards and greatly enhance the company s ability to rapidly design and lay out complex printed circuit board structures 
formfactor s proprietary design tools also enable it to design wafer probe cards particularly suited for testing today s low voltage  high power chips 
low voltage  high frequency chips require superior power supply performance  and the company s microspring interconnect technology is used to provide a very low inductance  low resistance electrical path between the power source and the chip under test 
in july  the company publicly announced its phs tm wafer probe card 
the phs wafer probe card leverages the company s proprietary technologies  including its microspring contact and design technologies and its precision micro machining manufacturing processes  to test mm dram or flash memory wafers in as few as four touchdowns 
the phs wafer probe card addresses the test issues and expands test capacity of capital equipment by enabling higher test throughput  producing a lower total cost of test for memory manufacturers 
because formfactor customers typically use the company s wafer probe cards in a wide range of operating temperatures  as opposed to conducting wafer probe test at one predetermined temperature  the company has designed thermal compensation characteristics into its products 
the company selects its wafer probe card materials after careful consideration of the potential range of test operating temperatures and designs its wafer probe cards to provide for a precise match with the thermal expansion characteristics of the wafer under test 
as a result  formfactor wafer probe cards generally are able to accurately probe over a large range of operating temperatures 
this feature enables the company s customers to use the same wafer probe card for both low and high temperature testing without a loss of performance 
in addition  for those testing situations that require positional accuracy at a specific temperature  the company has designed wafer probe cards optimized for testing at such temperatures 
formfactor s many spring shapes  different geometrically precise tip structures  various array sizes and diverse printed circuit board layouts enable a wide variety of solutions for its customers 
the company s 
table of contents designers select the most appropriate of these elements  or modify or improve upon such existing elements  and integrate them with the company s other technologies to deliver a custom solution optimized for the customer s requirements 
customers formfactor s customers include manufacturers in the dram  flash and logic markets 
the company s customers use its wafer probe cards to test dram chips including ddr  rdram  sdram and edram  static ram chips  nor and nand flash memory chips  serial data devices  chipsets  microprocessors and microcontrollers 
in fiscal  sales to four customers accounted for of the company s revenues 
in fiscal  sales to four customers accounted for of the company s revenues 
in fiscal  sales to three customers accounted for approximately of the company s revenues 
the customers accounting for these revenues were as follows fiscal fiscal fiscal intel corporation spirox corporation elpida infineon technologies ag less than of revenues 
except as identified above  no customer accounted for more than of the company s revenues during any of the last three fiscal years 
manufacturing the company manufactures its products at its facilities in livermore  california 
formfactor s proprietary manufacturing processes include wirebonding  photolithography  plating and metallurgical processes  dry and electro deposition  and complex interconnection system design 
the critical steps in the company s manufacturing process are performed in a class clean room environment 
formfactor also expends resources on the assembly and test of its wafer probe cards and on quality control 
in the company started transitioning its manufacturing operations to its new campus facility 
once the company completes the bring up of its new manufacturing facility and any required third party qualification requirements  the new facility is expected to increase the efficiency of the company s manufacturing operations 
formfactor depends upon suppliers for some critical components of its manufacturing processes  including ceramic substrates and complex printed circuit boards  and for materials used in its manufacturing processes 
some of these components and materials are supplied by a single vendor 
generally  the company relies on purchase orders rather than long term contracts with its suppliers  which subjects the company to risks including price increases and component shortages 
management continues to evaluate alternative sources of supply for these components and for materials 
formfactor maintains a repair and service capability in livermore  california 
the company provides service and maintenance capabilities in its service center in seoul  south korea 
the company also has a repair and service center in dresden  germany and tokyo  japan 
research  development and engineering the semiconductor industry is subject to rapid technological change and new product introductions and enhancements 
management believes that the company s continued commitment to research and development and timely introduction of new and enhanced wafer probe test solutions and other technologies related to 
table of contents its microspring interconnect technology is integral to maintaining its competitive position 
formfactor has and is continuing to invest considerable time and resources in creating structured processes for undertaking  tracking and completing the company s development projects  and plans to implement those developments into new product or technology offerings 
the company expects to continue to allocate significant resources to these efforts and to use automation and information technology to provide additional efficiencies in the company s research and development activities 
formfactor has historically devoted on average approximately of its revenues to research and development programs 
research and development expenses were million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal the company s research and development and product engineering activities are directed by individuals with significant expertise and industry experience 
as of december   the company had employees in research and development 
sales and marketing formfactor sells its products utilizing a proprietary sales model that emphasizes the customer s total cost of ownership as it relates to the costs of test 
with this sales model  the company strives to demonstrate how test costs can be reduced by simulating the customer s test floor environment  including testers and probers  utilizing its products and comparing the overall cost of test to that of conventional wafer probe cards 
the company sells its products worldwide primarily through its direct sales force  a distributor and independent sales representatives 
as of december   formfactor had sales professionals 
in north america  the company sells its products through its direct sales force 
in europe  the company s local sales team works with independent sales representatives 
in south korea  the company sells its products through its direct sales force 
in taiwan  china and singapore  formfactor sells through spirox corporation  the company s regional distributor 
in japan  the company sells its products through its tokyo based direct sales force 
the company s marketing staff  located in livermore  california and tokyo  japan  works closely with customers to understand their businesses  anticipate trends and define products that will provide significant technical and economic advantages to its customers 
formfactor also utilizes a highly skilled team of field application engineers that support the company s customers as they integrate the company s products into their manufacturing processes 
through this process  the company develops a close understanding of product and customer requirements  accelerating its customers production ramps 
environmental matters formfactor is subject to us federal and state and foreign governmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
management believes that the company complies with all material environmental laws and regulations that apply to formfactor 
in late and early formfactor received notices from the california department of toxic substances control and the bay area air quality management district regarding violations of certain environmental regulations 
formfactor promptly took appropriate steps to address all of the violations noted  believes that all such violations were addressed  and sent correspondence to the agencies confirming such corrective steps 
in  the company resolved a notice of violation from the bay area air quality management district through its corrective action and a payment of  in  the company resolved a notice of violation from the california department of toxic substances control through its corrective action and payment in the amount of  resolved a notice of violation from the bay area air quality management district through its corrective action and payment in the amount of  and resolved a citation and notification of penalty from the california division of occupational safety and health through its corrective action and payment in the amount of in february and april  the company received a total of four notices from the city of livermore water resources division regarding violations of applicable discharge limits in relation to certain of its wastewater 
table of contents discharge chemical storage permits 
in march  the company reported to appropriate authorities release of a fuel water mixture resulting in a notice of violation from the city of livermore water resources division 
the company believes it instituted appropriate corrective actions in all cases 
notwithstanding the company s corrective action  the notices of violation remain unresolved and the company may be subject to a penalty or additional enforcement actions based thereupon 
in august  the company reported to the appropriate authorities overflow of wastewater 
the company has not yet received any formal notices from an agency or governmental authority regarding any potential violation or notice of violation  and the matter  to date  remains unresolved 
in the future  the company may receive environmental violation notices  and that final resolution of the violations identified by these notices could harm its operating results 
new laws and regulations  stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations  the discovery of previously unknown contamination at the company s or others sites or the imposition of new cleanup requirements also could harm the company s operating results 
competition the highly competitive wafer probe card market is comprised of many domestic and foreign companies  and has historically been fragmented with many local suppliers servicing individual customers 
current and potential competitors in the wafer probe card market include advantest corporation  amst co  ltd  cascade microtech  inc  feinmetall gmbh  japan electronic materials corporation  kulicke and soffa industries  inc  micronics japan co  ltd  phicom corporation  scs hightech  inc  and tokyo electron ltd  among others 
in addition to the ability to address wafer probe card performance issues  the primary competitive factors in the company s industry include product quality and reliability  price  total cost of ownership  lead times  the ability to provide prompt and effective customer service  field applications support and timeliness of delivery 
some of formfactor s competitors are also suppliers of other types of test equipment or other semiconductor equipment  or offer both advanced wafer probe cards and needle probe cards  and may have greater financial and other resources than the company does 
the company expects that its competitors will enhance their current wafer probe products and may introduce new products that will be competitive with formfactor s wafer probe cards 
in addition  new competitors  including test equipment manufacturers  may offer new technologies that reduce the value of the company s wafer probe cards 
additionally  semiconductor manufacturers may implement chip designs that include built in self test capabilities or similar functions or methodologies that increase test throughput and eliminate some or all of the company s current competitive advantages 
the company s ability to compete favorably is also negatively impacted by low volume orders that do not meet its present minimum volume requirements  by very short cycle time requirements that the company cannot meet because of its design or manufacturing processes  by long standing relationships between its competitors and certain semiconductor manufacturers  and by semiconductor manufacturer test strategies that include low performance semiconductor testers 
intellectual property formfactor s success depends in part upon its ability to maintain and protect its proprietary technology and to conduct the company s business without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
the company relies on a combination of patents  trade secret laws  trademarks and contractual restrictions on disclosure to protect its intellectual property rights 
as of december   the company had issued patents  of which are united states patents and are foreign patents 
the expiration dates of these patents range from to formfactor s issued patents cover the company s core interconnect technology  as well as some of its inventions related to wafer probe cards and testing  wafer level packaging and test  sockets and assemblies and chips 
in addition  as of december   formfactor had patent applications pending worldwide  including united states applications  foreign national or regional stage applications and patent cooperation treaty applications 
the company cannot predict whether its current patent applications  or any future patent 
table of contents applications that the company may file  will result in a patent being issued with the scope of the claims formfactor seeks  or at all  or whether any patents that the company may receive will be challenged or invalidated 
even if additional patents are issued  formfactor s patents might not provide sufficiently broad coverage to protect its proprietary rights or to avoid a third party claim against one or more of its products or technologies 
formfactor has both registered and unregistered trademarks  including formfactor  microspring  microforce  microlign  most  phs  s  tre and the formfactor logo 
formfactor routinely requires its employees  customers  suppliers and potential business partners to enter into confidentiality and non disclosure agreements before the company discloses to them any sensitive or proprietary information regarding its products  technology or business plans 
the company requires employees to assign to it proprietary information  inventions and other intellectual property they create  modify or improve 
legal protections afford only limited protection for the company s proprietary rights 
despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of its products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
others might independently develop similar or competing technologies or methods or design around the company s patents 
in addition  leading companies in the semiconductor industry have extensive patent portfolios and other intellectual property with respect to semiconductor technology 
in the future  formfactor might receive claims that it is infringing intellectual property rights of others or that its patents or other intellectual property rights are invalid 
formfactor has received in the past  and may receive in the future  communications from third parties inquiring about our interest in licensing certain of their intellectual property or more generally identifying intellectual property that may be of interest to the company 
formfactor has invested significant time and resources in its technology  and as a part of its ongoing efforts to protect the intellectual property embodied in its proprietary technology  including its microspring interconnect technology  the company will be required to enforce its intellectual property rights against any infringing third parties 
in february  the company filed in the seoul southern district court  located in seoul  south korea  two separate complaints against phicom corporation  a korean corporation  alleging infringement of a total of four korean patents issued to formfactor  and is seeking injunctive relief 
in march  phicom filed in the korean intellectual property office invalidity actions challenging the validity of some or all of the claims of each of the four company patents at issue 
in november  the korean intellectual property office dismissed phicom s challenges against three of the patents at issue  but did not rule on the fourth 
phicom has appealed the dismissals of the challenges 
on march   the company filed a patent infringement lawsuit in federal district court in oregon against phicom charging that it is willfully infringing four us patents that cover key aspects of formfactor s wafer probe cards 
the complaint in this action alleges that phicom has incorporated the company s proprietary technology into its products and seeks both injunctive relief and monetary damages 
as of the date of this annual report  phicom had not responded to this complaint 
other third parties have initiated challenges in foreign patent offices against other company patents 
while the company does not have a monetary damages exposure in these various invalidity proceedings  it is possible the company will incur material expenses in defending its intellectual property at issue 
litigation may be necessary to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity  to determine the validity and scope of the company s proprietary rights or those of others  to enforce the company s intellectual property rights or to protect its trade secrets 
if formfactor threatens or initiates litigation  the company may be subject to claims by third parties against which it must defend 
intellectual property litigation  whether or not resolved in the company s favor  is expensive and time consuming and could divert management s attention from running formfactor s business 
if an infringement claim against the company resulted in an adverse ruling  formfactor could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the use or sale of infringing products  spend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue the use of certain technology or obtain a license to the technology 
management cannot predict whether a license agreement would be available  or whether the terms and conditions would be acceptable to the company 
in addition  many of formfactor 
table of contents customer contracts contain provisions that require the company to indemnify its customers for third party intellectual property infringement claims  which would increase the cost to formfactor of an adverse ruling in such a claim 
an adverse determination could also prevent the company from licensing its technologies and methods to others 
employees as of december   formfactor had full time employees  including in research and development  in sales and marketing  in general and administrative functions  and in operations 
by region  of the company s employees were in north america  in japan  in south korea and in europe 
no employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
the company believes that its relations with its employees is good

overview we design  develop  manufacture  sell and support precision  high performance advanced semiconductor wafer probe cards 
semiconductor manufacturers use our wafer probe cards to perform wafer probe test on the whole semiconductor wafer in the front end of the semiconductor manufacturing process 
after the fabrication of a semiconductor wafer  the chips on the wafer are subject to wafer probe test 
during wafer probe test  a wafer probe card is mounted in a prober  which is in turn connected to a semiconductor tester  and the wafer probe card is used as an interface to connect electronically with and test individual chips on a wafer 
at the core of our product offering are our proprietary technologies  including our microspring interconnect technology and design processes 
our microspring interconnect technology includes a resilient contact element manufactured at our production facilities in livermore  california 
we operate in a single industry segment for the design  development  manufacture  sale and support of precision  high performance advanced semiconductor wafer probe cards  and  to date we have derived our revenues primarily from the sale of wafer probe cards incorporating our microspring interconnect technology 
we were formed in and in introduced our first commercial product 
during  we introduced the industry s first memory wafer probe card capable of testing up to devices in parallel 
our revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal management focuses on various external measures that impact our performance  including for example  semiconductor manufacturer technology transitions  semiconductor manufacturing wafer fabrication facility expansions  semiconductor device architecture changes and implementations  and new market developments 
we work closely with our customers to design  develop and manufacture custom wafer probe cards 
each wafer probe card is a custom product that is specific to the chip and wafer designs of the customer 
our customers  in turn  operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry and are subject to severe fluctuations in the demand for their products 
because of the nature of our customers and our business  our revenue growth is driven in significant part by the number of new semiconductor designs  that our customers develop  the technology transitions involved in these designs and our customers production volumes 
in the past  this has resulted in our being subject to demand fluctuations that have resulted in significant variations of revenues  expenses and results of operations in the periods presented 
we expect these fluctuations  and the resulting variations in our financial results  to continue in future periods 
the majority of our sales are directly to semiconductor manufacturers 
in fiscal  sales to four customers accounted for of the company s revenues 
because the semiconductor industry is a relatively concentrated industry  we believe that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of our business 
we generally have limited backlog and therefore we rely upon orders that are booked and shipped in the same quarter for a majority of our revenues 
our backlog increased from million at december  to million at december  we manufacture our wafer probe cards based on order backlog and customer commitments 
backlog includes only orders for which written authorizations have been accepted  shipment dates within months have been assigned and revenue has not been recognized 
in addition  backlog includes service revenue for existing product service agreements to be earned within the next months 
in addition to direct sales we also have significant sales to our distributor in taiwan 
sales to our distributor were of revenues in fiscal sales to our distributor were of revenues in fiscal and of revenues in fiscal we sold our products in japan through a 
table of contents distributor until march   when we began to sell directly in japan 
currently  we have one distributor  spirox corporation  which serves taiwan  singapore and china 
we also have the ability to sell our products directly to customers in that region 
we believe the following information is key to understanding our business  our financial statements and the remainder of this discussion and analysis of our financial condition fiscal year 
our fiscal year ends on the last saturday in december 
the fiscal years ended december   december  and december  had weeks each 
revenues 
we derive our revenues from product sales  license and development fees and royalties 
wafer probe card sales accounted for of our revenues in fiscal  of our revenues in fiscal and of our revenues in fiscal revenues from licensing of our design and manufacturing technologies have historically been insignificant 
increases in revenues have resulted from increased demand for our existing products  the introduction of new  more complex products and the penetration of new markets 
revenues from our customers are subject to both quarterly  annual and other fluctuations due to design cycles  technology adoption rates and cyclicality of the different end markets into which our customers products are sold 
we expect that revenues from the sale of wafer probe cards will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of manufacturing materials  payroll and manufacturing related overhead 
our manufacturing operations rely upon a limited number of suppliers to provide key components and materials for our products  some of which are sole source suppliers 
we order materials and supplies based on backlog and forecasted customer orders 
tooling and setup costs related to changing manufacturing lots at our suppliers are also included in the cost of revenues 
we expense all warranty costs and inventory reserves or write offs of inventory as cost of revenues 
we design  manufacture and sell a fully custom product into a market that is subject to significant cyclicality and demand fluctuations 
wafer probe cards are complex products  custom to every specific chip design and have to be delivered on lead times of most manufacturers cycle times 
it is therefore common to start production and to acquire production materials ahead of the receipt of an actual purchase order 
wafer probe cards are manufactured in low volumes  therefore  material purchases are often subject to minimum purchase order quantities in excess of our actual demand 
inventory valuation adjustments for these factors are considered a normal component of cost of revenues 
research and development 
research and development expenses include expenses related to product development  engineering and material costs 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we devoted  and of our revenues to research and development programs in fiscal  and  respectively 
we plan to continue to invest a significant amount in research and development activities to develop new technologies for current and new markets and new applications 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales  marketing and administrative personnel  internal and outside sales representatives commissions  market research and consulting  and other marketing and sales activities 
we expect that selling expenses will increase as revenues increase  and we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars to support future operations  as well as from the additional costs of being a publicly traded company including compliance with sarbanes oxley 
as revenues increase  we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to decline as a percentage of revenues 
stock based compensation 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees in fiscal  fiscal  and in fiscal through our initial public offering in june  we recorded an aggregate of million in deferred stock based compensation 
these options are considered compensatory because the fair value of our stock determined for financial reporting purposes is greater than the fair value determined on the date of the grant 
in addition  we recorded an aggregate of million in deferred stock based compensation in fiscal related to the issuance of restricted stock 
as of december   we had an aggregate of million of deferred stock based compensation remaining to be amortized 
this deferred stock based compensation balance would be amortized  absent adoption of fasb r  as follows 
table of contents million during fiscal  million during fiscal   during fiscal we are amortizing this deferred stock based compensation on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the related options  which is generally four to five years 
for options granted to employees to date  the amount of stock based compensation amortization to be recognized in future periods could decrease if options for which deferred but unvested compensation has been recorded are forfeited 
provision for income taxes 
on october   president bush signed the american jobs creation act the act into law 
the act contains provisions that might affect our future effective tax rate 
among other things  the act will provide a one time dividends received deduction for certain foreign earnings repatriated during a one year period and the replacement of the current extraterritorial income exclusion with a deduction with respect to income of certain us manufacturing activities 
the provisions of the act do not impact the fiscal year financial statements under current accounting rules 
while we are currently evaluating the future impact of the act  we do not anticipate the impact from the provision of a one time dividends received deduction on the effective tax rate would be material due to immaterial accumulated amount of foreign earnings 
we are currently evaluating the impact from the provision of us manufacturing activities on the effective tax rate 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
note of our notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 
a critical accounting policy is defined as a policy that is both material to the presentation of our consolidated financial statements and requires management to apply judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for doubtful receivables  inventories  investments  income taxes  warranty obligations  contingencies  litigation and accrual for other liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
for excess component costs  the estimates are dependent on our expected use of such components and the size of the minimum order quantity imposed by the vendor in relation to our inventory requirements 
because this can vary in each situation  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known 
in addition  we are periodically faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within our control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time 
these uncertainties are discussed in the section below entitled trends  risks and uncertainties 
based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  we believe that our consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and provide a meaningful presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we believe that the following are critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which supersedes sab sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue for those transactions could be deferred and revenue recognized for current reporting periods could be adversely affected 
revenues from product sales to customers other than distributors are recognized upon shipment or delivery depending upon the terms of sale and reserves are provided for estimated allowances 
we defer recognition of revenues on sales to distributors until the distributor confirms an order from its customer 
revenues from licensing of our design and manufacturing technology  which have been insignificant to date  are recognized over the term of the license agreement or when the significant contractual obligations have been fulfilled 
warranty reserve 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
we continuously monitor product returns for warranty and maintain a reserve for the related expenses based upon our historical experience and any specifically identified field failures 
as we sell new products to our customers  we must exercise considerable judgment in estimating the expected failure rates 
this estimating process is based on historical experience of similar products  the estimated warranty period  which is generally to months  as well as various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
from time to time  we may be subject to additional costs related to warranty claims from our customers 
if and when this occurs  we generally make significant judgments and estimates in establishing the related warranty liability 
this estimating process is based on historical experience  communication with our customers  and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this additional warranty would be recorded in the determination of net income in the period in which the additional cost was identified 
inventory reserve 
we state our inventories at the lower of cost  computed on a first in  first out basis  or market 
we record inventory reserve for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserve would be required 
inventory reserves once established are not reversed until the related inventory has been scrapped or sold 
impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of 
we account for the impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a prolonged industry downturn  a significant decline in our market value or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including profit margins  long term forecasts of the amounts 
table of contents and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  groupings of assets  discount rates and terminal growth rates 
in addition  significant estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of the fair value of our tangible long lived assets  including replacement cost  economic obsolescence  and the value that could be realized in orderly liquidation 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our long lived assets  thereby requiring us to write down the assets 
our net long lived assets as of december  and december   included property and equipment of million and million  respectively 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
the tax consequences of most events recognized in the current year s financial statements are included in determining income taxes currently payable 
however  because tax laws and financial accounting standards differ in their recognition and measurement of assets  liabilities  equity  revenue  expenses  gains and losses  differences arise between the amount of taxable income and pre tax financial income for a year and between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
because it is assumed that the reported amounts of assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled  respectively  a difference between the tax basis of an asset or a liability and its reported amount in the balance sheet will result in a taxable or a deductible amount in some future years when the related liabilities are settled or the reported amounts of the assets are recovered  hence giving rise to a deferred tax asset 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences that may result in deferred tax assets 
management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
any such valuation allowance would be based on our estimates of taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets would be recoverable 
while management has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would result in additional income tax expense in such period 
in fiscal  we released our valuation allowance because  based upon our recurring level of profitability  we believed that it was more likely than not that we would be able to utilize our deferred tax assets before they expired 
in fiscal and  given our increasing levels of profitability  we concluded that it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize our deferred tax assets before they expire 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed 
differences between tax provision and tax return may occur and such adjustments are recorded when identified  which is generally in the third quarter of the subsequent year for us federal and state provisions 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities which might result in proposed assessments 
our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is judgmental in nature 
however  we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable foreseeable outcome related to those matters 
our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire

revenues for fiscal were million compared with million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the million increase was due primarily to an increase of million in revenues from dram manufacturers  an increase of million from manufacturers of flash memory devices and an increase of  in other revenues and a decrease of million in revenues from manufacturers of flip chip devices 
revenues continued to grow across all regions as conventional probe cards continue to be replaced by advanced wafer test technologies and more test was performed at the wafer level 
the build out of mm wafer production capacity brought additional demand for wafer probe cards as part of our customers overall capacity expansion 
new applications like mobile ram  the transition to nanometer technologies  as well as design wins in flash memory contributed to the overall growth in revenues 
revenues for the fourth quarter of were negatively impacted by approximately million due to a severe decline in our production yields caused by contamination of our existing wafer production line at our old production facility 
the majority of revenues for fiscal were generated by sales of wafer probe cards to manufacturers of dram devices 
sales of wafer probe cards to test dram devices accounted for million  or of revenues for fiscal compared to million  or of revenues  for fiscal the increase was primarily due to a general increase in customer bit production volume as well as the continued execution of major dram transitions to and sub nanometer technology  megabit density  mm capacity ramps  ddr ii architecture and mobile ram applications 
revenues generated from sales to flash memory device manufacturers increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase was driven by strong bit growth and the demand for 
table of contents high parallelism flash memory test products as well as the continued ramp in mm capacity 
we do not currently expect to continue to realize a growth rate in future fiscal years

gross margin as a percentage of revenues was for fiscal compared with for fiscal gross margin remained stable due to higher revenues despite million of start up costs for our new factory 
gross margin was negatively impacted by approximately due a severe decline in our wafer yields caused by contamination in our existing production line at our old production facility during the fourth quarter 
we will continue to incur startup expenses relating to our new factory in  including non recurring personnel and material expenses required for the new site ramp and qualification as well as redundancy costs for maintaining two production sites in parallel 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million  or of revenues  for fiscal compared to million  or of revenues  for fiscal the increase in absolute dollars was mainly due to an increase of approximately million in personnel costs and an increase of approximately million in development program materials and related costs 
during fiscal  we continued our development of next generation parallelism products  fine pitch memory and logic products  advanced microspring interconnect technology and new process technologies 
we are currently building a dedicated research and development line as part of our new site project  as we believe it is critical to continue to make significant investments in research and development

the following customers accounted for more than of our revenues for fiscal or fiscal fiscal fiscal intel corporation spirox corporation elpida infineon technologies ag less than of revenues 
gross margin 
gross margin as a percentage of revenues was for fiscal compared with for fiscal the decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily due to increased fixed costs and a change in product mix 
we increased our manufacturing fixed costs in response to a continued positive demand for our products and continued design wins 
the fixed cost increase was primarily due to an increase in headcount  which we needed to convert our operations to a day  hour manufacturing shift structure 
we began implementing this new manufacturing shift structure during the second quarter of and completed the implementation in the third quarter of this structure further increased our capacity and enabled us to be in a position to transfer our manufacturing processes into our new production facility 

table of contents research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million  or of revenues  for fiscal compared to million  or of revenues  for fiscal the increase in absolute dollars is mainly due to increased personnel costs associated with an increase of product development activities in fiscal during fiscal  we continued our development of next generation parallelism products  fine pitch memory and logic products  advanced microspring interconnect technology and higher speed wafer probe

trends  risks and uncertainties you should carefully consider the following risk factors  as well as the other information in this annual report on form k  in evaluating formfactor and our business 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations would suffer 
accordingly  the trading price of our common stock would likely decline and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock 
the 
table of contents risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks that we currently do not know about or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations

our operating results are likely to fluctuate 
as a result  we believe you should not rely on period to period comparisons of our financial results as indicator of our future performance 
some of the important factors that could cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate from period to period include customer demand for our products  our ability to deliver reliable  cost effective products in a timely manner  the reduction  rescheduling or cancellation of orders by our customers  the timing and success of new product introductions and new technologies by our competitors and us  our product and customer sales mix and geographical sales mix  changes in the level of our operating expenses needed to support our anticipated growth  a reduction in the price or the profitability of our products  changes in our production capacity or the availability or the cost of components and materials  our ability to bring new products into volume production efficiently  our ability to add manufacturing capacity and to stabilize production yields and ramp production volume  our ability to efficiently build out and move into its new manufacturing facility  our relationships with customers and companies that manufacture semiconductor test equipment  the timing of and return on our investments in research and development  our ability to collect accounts receivable  seasonality  principally due to our customers purchasing cycles  and market conditions in our industry  the semiconductor industry and the economy as a whole 
the occurrence of one or more of these factors might cause our operating results to vary widely 
for example  we recently announced that  due to contamination in our manufacturing process that affected our ability to timely ship product  our revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal were below our previous guidance and declined relative to the third quarter of fiscal if our revenues or operating results fall below the expectations of market analysts or investors  the market price of our common stock could decline substantially 
cyclicality in the semiconductor industry historically has affected our sales and might do so in the future  and as a result we could experience reduced revenues or operating results 
the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical and is characterized by wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
from time to time  this industry has experienced significant downturns  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product and technology cycles  excess inventories and declines in general economic conditions 
this cyclicality could cause our operating results to decline dramatically from one period to the next 
for example  our revenues in the three months ended september  declined by compared to our revenues in the three months ended june   and our revenues in the three months ended march  declined by compared to our revenues in the three months ended december  our business depends heavily upon the development of new semiconductors and semiconductor designs  the volume of production by semiconductor manufacturers and the overall financial strength of our customers  which  in turn  depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for 
table of contents semiconductors and products  such as personal computers  that use semiconductors 
semiconductor manufacturers generally sharply curtail their spending during industry downturns and historically have lowered their spending disproportionately more than the decline in their revenues 
as a result  if we are unable to adjust our levels of manufacturing and human resources or manage our costs and deliveries from suppliers in response to lower spending by semiconductor manufacturers  our gross margin might decline and cause us to experience operating losses 
if we are unable to manufacture our products efficiently  our operating results could suffer 
we must continuously modify our manufacturing processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance  lower our costs and reduce the time it takes us to design and produce our products 
we also may be subject to events that negatively affect our manufacturing processes and impact our business and operating results 
for example  during our fiscal quarter ending december   we experienced a contamination problem in our manufacturing line 
this contamination problem caused a yield decline that  in turn  resulted in our inability to timely ship products to our customers 
we will incur significant start up costs associated with implementing new manufacturing technologies  methods and processes and purchasing new equipment  which could negatively impact our gross margin 
we could experience manufacturing delays and inefficiencies as we refine new manufacturing technologies  methods and processes  implement them in volume production and qualify them with customers  which could cause our operating results to decline 
the risk of encountering delays or difficulties increases as we manufacture more complex products 
in addition  if demand for our products increases  we will need to expand our operations to manufacture sufficient quantities of products without increasing our production times or our unit costs 
as a result of such expansion  we could be required to purchase new equipment  upgrade existing equipment  develop and implement new manufacturing processes and hire additional technical personnel 
further  new or expanded manufacturing facilities could be subject to qualification by our customers 
in the past  we have experienced difficulties in expanding our operations to manufacture our products in volume on time and at acceptable cost 
any difficulties in expanding our manufacturing operations could cause product delivery delays and lost sales 
if demand for our products decreases  we could have excess manufacturing capacity 
the fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity could cause our operating results to decline 
if we are unable to achieve further manufacturing efficiencies and cost reductions  particularly if we are experiencing pricing pressures in the marketplace  our operating results could suffer 
if we do not keep pace with technological developments in the semiconductor industry  our products might not be competitive and our revenues and operating results could suffer 
we must continue to invest in research and development to improve our competitive position and to meet the needs of our customers 
our future growth depends  in significant part  upon our ability to work effectively with and anticipate the testing needs of our customers  and on our ability to develop and support new products and product enhancements to meet these needs on a timely and cost effective basis 
our customers testing needs are becoming more challenging as the semiconductor industry continues to experience rapid technological change driven by the demand for complex circuits that are shrinking in size and at the same time are increasing in speed and functionality and becoming less expensive to produce 
examples of recent trends driving demand for technological research and development include semiconductor manufacturers transitions to nanometer and nanometer technology nodes  to megabit density devices and to double date rate ii  or ddr ii  architecture devices 
by further example  the anticipated transition to double data rate iii  or ddr iii  architecture devices will be a technological change for the semiconductor industry 
our customers expect that they will be able to integrate our wafer probe cards into any manufacturing process as soon as it is deployed 
therefore  to meet these expectations and remain competitive  we must continually design  develop and introduce on a timely basis new products and product enhancements with improved features 
successful product design  development and introduction on a timely basis require that we design innovative and performance enhancing features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors  
table of contents transition our products to new manufacturing technologies  identify emerging technological trends in our target markets  maintain effective marketing strategies  respond effectively to technological changes or product announcements by others  and adjust to changing market conditions quickly and cost effectively 
we must devote significant research and development resources to keep up with the rapidly evolving technologies used in semiconductor manufacturing processes 
not only do we need the technical expertise to implement the changes necessary to keep our technologies current  but we must also rely heavily on the judgment of our management to anticipate future market trends 
if we are unable to timely predict industry changes  or if we are unable to modify our products on a timely basis  we might lose customers or market share 
in addition  we might not be able to recover our research and development expenditures  which could harm our operating results 
if semiconductor memory device manufacturers do not continue the conversion to mm wafers  our growth could be impeded 
the growth of our business for the foreseeable future depends in large part upon sales of our wafer probe cards to manufacturers of dynamic random access memory  or dram  and flash memory devices 
the recent downturn in the semiconductor industry caused various chip manufacturers to readdress their respective strategies for converting existing mm wafer fabrication facilities to mm wafer fabrication  or for building new mm wafer fabrication facilities 
some manufacturers have delayed  cancelled or postponed previously announced plans to convert to mm wafer fabrication 
we believe that the decision to convert to a mm wafer fabrication facility is made by each manufacturer based upon both internal and external factors  such as current and projected chip prices  projected price erosion for the manufacturer s particular chips  supply and demand issues  overall manufacturing capability within the manufacturer s target market s  the availability of funds to the manufacturer  the technology roadmap of the manufacturer  and the price and availability of equipment needed within the mm facility 
one or more of these internal and external factors  as well as other factors  including factors that a manufacturer may choose to not publicly disclose  can impact the decision to maintain a mm conversion schedule  to delay the conversion schedule for a period of time  or to cancel the conversion 
it is also possible that the conversion to mm wafers will occur on different schedules for dram chip manufacturers and flash memory chip manufacturers 
we have invested significant resources to develop technology that addresses the market for mm wafers 
if manufacturers of memory devices delay or discontinue their current mm wafer conversion  or make the transition more slowly than we currently expect  our growth and profitability could be impeded 
in addition  any delay in large scale adoption of manufacturing based upon mm wafers would provide time for other companies to develop and market products that compete with ours  which could harm our competitive position 
we are subject to general economic and market conditions 
our business is subject to the effects of general economic conditions in the united states and worldwide  and to market conditions in the semiconductor industry in particular 
our operating results could be adversely affected by unfavorable global economic conditions and reduced capital spending by semiconductor 
table of contents manufacturers 
such adverse conditions could result in a decrease in the demand for semiconductors and products using semiconductors  and in a sharp reduction in the development of new semiconductors and semiconductor designs 
as a result  we could experience a decrease in the demand for our wafer probe cards 
we depend upon the sale of our wafer probe cards for substantially all of our revenues  and a downturn in demand for our products could have a more disproportionate impact on our revenues than if we derived revenues from a more diversified product offering 
historically  we have derived substantially all of our revenues from the sale of our wafer probe cards 
we anticipate that sales of our wafer probe cards will represent a substantial majority of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
our business depends in large part upon continued demand in current markets for  and adoption in new markets of  current and future generations of our wafer probe cards 
large scale market adoption depends upon our ability to increase customer awareness of the benefits of our wafer probe cards and to prove their reliability  ability to increase yields and cost effectiveness 
we may be unable to sell our wafer probe cards to certain potential customers unless those customers change their device test strategies  change their wafer probe card and capital equipment buying strategies  or change or upgrade their existing test equipment 
we might not be able to sustain or increase our revenues from sales of our wafer probe cards  particularly if conditions in the semiconductor market deteriorate or do not improve or if the market enters into another downturn in the future 
any decrease in revenues from sales of our wafer probe cards could harm our business more than it would if we offered a more diversified line of products 
if demand for our products in the memory device and flip chip logic markets declines or fails to grow as we anticipate  our revenues could decline 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from wafer probe cards that we sell to manufacturers of dram memory and flash memory devices and manufacturers of microprocessor  chipset and other logic devices 
in the microprocessor  chipset and other logic device markets  our products are primarily used for devices employing flip chip packaging  which devices are commonly referred to as flip chip logic devices 
in fiscal  sales to manufacturers of dram devices accounted for of our revenues  sales to manufacturers of flip chip logic devices accounted for of our revenues  and sales to manufacturers of flash memory devices accounted for of our revenues 
for fiscal  sales to manufacturers of dram devices accounted for of our revenues  sales to manufacturers of flip chip logic devices accounted for of our revenues  and sales to manufacturers of flash memory devices accounted for of our revenues 
therefore  our success depends in part upon the continued acceptance of our products within these markets and our ability to continue to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis for these markets 
for example  the market might not accept an increasingly high parallelism wafer test solution 
a substantial portion of these semiconductor devices is sold to manufacturers of personal computers and computer related products and to manufacturers of personal electronic devices 
both the personal computer market and the personal electronic devices market have historically been characterized by significant fluctuations in demand and continuous efforts to reduce costs  which in turn have affected the demand for and price of memory devices and microprocessors 
the personal computer market might not grow in the future at historical rates or at all and design activity in the personal computer market might decrease  which could negatively affect our revenues and operating results 
the markets in which we participate are highly competitive  and if we do not compete effectively  our operating results could be harmed 
the wafer probe card market is highly competitive 
with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants  we expect competition to intensify in the future 
in the past  increased competition has resulted in price reductions  reduced gross margins or loss of market share  and could do so in the future 
competitors might introduce new competitive products for the same markets that our products currently serve 
these products may have better performance  lower prices and broader acceptance than our products 
in addition  for products such as wafer probe cards  semiconductor manufacturers typically qualify more than one source  to avoid dependence on a single source of supply 
as a result  our customers will likely purchase 
table of contents products from our competitors 
current and potential competitors include advantest corporation  amst co  ltd  cascade microtech  inc  feinmetall gmbh  japan electronic materials corporation  kulicke and soffa industries  inc  micronics japan co  ltd  phicom corporation  scs hightech  inc 
and tokyo electron  ltd  among others 
many of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition  larger customer bases  more established customer relationships or greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing and other resources than we do 
as a result  they might be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products  and reduce prices to increase market share 
some of our competitors also supply other types of test equipment  or offer both advanced wafer probe cards and needle probe cards 
those competitors that offer both advanced wafer probe cards and needle probe cards might have strong  existing relationships with our customers or with potential customers 
because we do not offer a needle probe card or other conventional technology wafer probe card for less advanced applications  it may be difficult for us to introduce our advanced wafer probe cards to these customers and potential customers for certain wafer test applications 
it is possible that existing or new competitors  including test equipment manufacturers  may offer new technologies that reduce the value of our wafer probe cards 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of customers  and our revenues could decline significantly if any major customer cancels  reduces or delays a purchase of our products 
a relatively small number of customers has accounted for a significant portion of our revenues in any particular period 
in fiscal  four customers accounted for of our revenues 
in fiscal  four customers accounted for of our revenues 
our ten largest customers accounted for of our revenues in fiscal and of our revenues in fiscal we anticipate that sales of our products to a relatively small number of customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues 
the cancellation or deferral of even a small number of purchases of our products could cause our revenues to decline in any particular quarter 
a number of factors could cause customers to cancel or defer orders  including manufacturing delays  interruptions to our customers operations due to fire  natural disasters or other events or a downturn in the semiconductor industry 
our agreements with our customers do not contain minimum purchase commitments  and our customers could cease purchasing our products with short or no notice to us or fail to pay all or part of an invoice 
in some situations  our customers might be able to cancel orders without a significant penalty 
in addition  the continuing trend toward consolidation in the semiconductor industry  particularly among manufacturers of drams  could reduce our customer base and lead to lost or delayed sales and reduced demand for our wafer probe cards 
industry consolidation also could result in pricing pressures as larger dram manufacturers could have sufficient bargaining power to demand reduced prices and favorable nonstandard terms 
additionally  certain customers may not want to rely entirely or substantially on a single wafer probe card supplier and  as a result  such customers could reduce their purchases of our wafer probe cards 
if our relationships with our customers and companies that manufacture semiconductor test equipment deteriorate  our product development activities could be harmed 
the success of our product development efforts depends upon our ability to anticipate market trends and to collaborate closely with our customers and with companies that manufacture semiconductor test equipment 
our relationships with these customers and companies provide us with access to valuable information regarding manufacturing and process technology trends in the semiconductor industry  which enables us to better plan our product development activities 
these relationships also provide us with opportunities to understand the performance and functionality requirements of our customers  which improve our ability to customize our products to fulfill their needs 
our relationships with test equipment companies are important to us because test equipment companies can design our wafer probe cards into their equipment and provide us with the insight into their product plans that allows us to offer wafer probe cards for use with their products when they are introduced to the market 
our relationships with our customers and test equipment companies could deteriorate if they become concerned about our ability to protect their intellectual property  
table of contents become concerned with our ability to deliver quality products on a timely basis  develop their own solutions to address the need for testing improvement  implement chip designs that include enhanced built in self test capabilities  regard us as a competitor  introduce their own wafer probe card product  establish relationships with others in our industry  or attempt to restrict our ability to enter into relationships with their competitors 
many of our customers and the test equipment companies we work with are large companies 
the consequences of a deterioration in our relationship with any of these companies could be exacerbated due to the significant influence these companies can exert in our markets 
if our current relationships with our customers and test equipment companies deteriorate  or if we are unable to develop similar collaborative relationships with important customers and test equipment companies in the future  our long term ability to produce commercially successful products could be impaired 
because we generally do not have a sufficient backlog of unfilled orders to meet our quarterly revenue targets  revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent upon customer orders received and fulfilled in that quarter 
our revenues are difficult to forecast because we generally do not have a sufficient backlog of unfilled orders to meet our quarterly revenue targets at the beginning of a quarter 
rather  a substantial percentage of our revenues in any quarter depends upon customer orders for our wafer probe cards that we receive and fulfill in that quarter 
because our expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future revenues and to a large extent are fixed in the short term  we might be unable to adjust spending in time to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in revenues 
accordingly  any significant shortfall of revenues in relation to our expectations could hurt our operating results 
we rely upon a distributor for a substantial portion of our revenues  and a disruption or other change in our relationship with our distributor could have a negative impact on our revenues 
we rely on spirox corporation  our distributor in taiwan  singapore and china  for a substantial portion of our revenues 
sales to spirox accounted for of our revenues in fiscal and of our revenues in fiscal spirox also provides customer support 
a reduction in the sales or service efforts or financial viability of our distributor  or deterioration in  or termination of  our relationship with our distributor could harm our revenues  our operating results and our ability to support our customers in the distributor s territory 
in addition  establishing alternative sales channels in the region could consume substantial time and resources  decrease our revenues and increase our expenses 
if our relationships with our independent sales representatives change  our business could be harmed 
we currently rely on independent sales representatives to assist us in the sale of our products in various geographic regions 
if we make the business decision to terminate or modify our relationships with one or more of our independent sales representatives  or if an independent sales representative decides to disengage from us  and we do not effectively and efficiently manage such a change  we could lose sales to existing customers and fail to obtain new customers 
if semiconductor manufacturers do not migrate elements of final test to wafer probe test  market acceptance of other applications of our technology could be delayed 
we intend to work with our customers to migrate elements of final test from the device level to the wafer level 
this migration will involve a change in semiconductor test strategies from concentrating final test at the individual device level to increasing the amount of test at the wafer level 
semiconductor manufacturers 
table of contents typically take time to qualify new strategies that affect their testing operations 
as a result  general acceptance of wafer level final test might not occur in the near term or at all 
in addition  semiconductor manufacturers might not accept and use wafer level final test in a way that uses our technology 
if the migration of elements of final test to wafer probe test does not grow as we anticipate  or if semiconductor manufacturers do not adopt our technology for their wafer probe test requirements  market acceptance of other applications for our technology could be delayed 
changes in test strategies  equipment and processes could cause us to lose revenues 
the demand for wafer probe cards depends in large part upon the number of semiconductor designs and the overall semiconductor unit volume 
the time it takes to test a wafer depends upon the number of devices being tested  the complexity of these devices  the test software program and the test equipment itself 
as test programs become increasingly effective and test throughput increases  the number of wafer probe cards required to test a given volume of devices declines 
therefore  advances in the test process could cause us to lose sales 
if semiconductor manufacturers implement chip designs that include increased built in self test capabilities  or similar functions or methodologies that increase test throughput  it could negatively impact our sales or the migration of elements of final test to the wafer level 
additionally  if new chip designs or types of chips are implemented that require less  or even no  test using wafer probe cards  or significantly reduce wafer test complexity our revenues could be impacted 
further  if new chip designs are implemented which we are unable to test  or which we are unable to test efficiently and provide our customers with an acceptably low overall cost of test  our revenues could be negatively impacted 
we incur significant research and development expenses in conjunction with the introduction of new product platforms 
often  we time our product introductions to the introduction of new test equipment platforms or the declination of manufacturers to adopt a new test platform 
because our customers require both test equipment and wafer probe cards  any delay or disruption of the introduction of new test equipment platforms would negatively affect our growth 
we manufacture all of our products at a single facility  and any disruption in the operations of that facility could adversely impact our business and operating results 
our processes for manufacturing our wafer probe cards require sophisticated and costly equipment and a specially designed facility  including a semiconductor clean room 
we manufacture all of our wafer probe cards at one facility located in livermore  california 
any disruption in the operation of that facility  whether due to contamination in our manufacturing process  technical or labor difficulties  destruction or damage from fire or earthquake  infrastructure failures such as power or water shortage or any other reason  could interrupt our manufacturing operations  impair critical systems  disrupt communications with our customers and suppliers and cause us to write off inventory and to lose sales 
in addition  if the previous energy crises in california that resulted in disruptions in power supply and increases in utility costs were to recur  we might experience power interruptions and shortages  which could disrupt our manufacturing operations 
this could subject us to loss of revenues as well as significantly higher costs of energy 
further  current and potential customers might not purchase our products if they perceive our lack of an alternate manufacturing facility to be a risk to their continuing source of supply 
if we do not transition effectively to our new operations and manufacturing site  our manufacturing capacity will be negatively impacted 
we moved into our new facility in livermore in the costs of starting up our new manufacturing facility  including capital costs such as equipment and fixed costs such as rent  are substantial 
we might not be able to shift from our current production facility to the new production facility efficiently or effectively 
our current transition plan will require us to have both our existing and new manufacturing facilities operational through our third fiscal quarter of this will cause us to incur significant costs due to redundancy of infrastructure at both sites 
furthermore  the qualification of the new manufacturing facility will require us to 
table of contents use materials and build product and product components that will not be sold to our customers  causing higher than normal material spending 
the transition might also lead to manufacturing interruptions  which could mean delayed deliveries or lost sales 
some or all of our customers could require a full qualification of our new facility 
any qualification process could take longer than we anticipate 
any difficulties with the transition or with bringing the new manufacturing facility to full capacity and volume production could increase our costs  disrupt our production process and cause delays in product delivery and lost sales  which would harm our operating results 
if we are unable to continue to reduce the time it takes for us to design and produce a wafer probe card  our growth could be impeded 
our customers continuously seek to reduce the time it takes them to introduce new products to market 
the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry  coupled with changing demands for semiconductor devices  requires our customers to be flexible and highly adaptable to changes in the volume and mix of products they must produce 
each of those changes requires a new design and each new design requires a new wafer probe card 
for some existing semiconductor devices  the manufacturers volume and mix of product requirements are such that we are unable to design  manufacture and ship products to meet such manufacturers relatively short cycle time requirements 
if we are unable to reduce the time it takes for us to design  manufacture and ship our products in response to the needs of our customers  our competitive position could be harmed 
if we are unable to meet a customer s schedule for wafer probe cards for a particular design  our customer might purchase wafer probe cards from a competitor and we might lose sales 
we obtain some of the components and materials we use in our products from a single or sole source or a limited group of suppliers  and the partial or complete loss of one of these suppliers could cause production delays and a substantial loss of revenues 
we obtain some of the components and materials used in our products  such as printed circuit board assemblies  plating materials and ceramic substrates  from a single or sole source or a limited group of suppliers 
alternative sources are not currently available for sole source components and materials 
because we rely on purchase orders rather than long term contracts with the majority of our suppliers  we cannot predict with certainty our ability to obtain components and materials in the longer term 
a sole or limited source supplier could increase prices  which could lead to a decline in our gross margin 
our dependence upon sole or limited source suppliers exposes us to several other risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of materials  late deliveries and poor component quality 
disruption or termination of the supply of components or materials could delay shipments of our products  damage our customer relationships and reduce our revenues 
for example  if we were unable to obtain an adequate supply of a component or material  we might have to use a substitute component or material  which could require us to make changes in our manufacturing process 
from time to time in the past  we have experienced difficulties in receiving shipments from one or more of our suppliers  especially during periods of high demand for our products 
if we cannot obtain an adequate supply of the components and materials we require  or do not receive them in a timely manner  we might be required to identify new suppliers 
we might not be able to identify new suppliers on a timely basis or at all 
our customers and we would also need to qualify any new suppliers 
the lead time required to identify and qualify new suppliers could affect our ability to timely ship our products and cause our operating results to suffer 
further  a sole or limited source supplier could require us to enter into non cancelable purchase commitments or pay in advance to ensure our source of supply 
in an industry downturn  commitments of this type could result in charges for excess inventory of parts 
if we are unable to predict our component and materials needs accurately  or if our supply is disrupted  we might miss market opportunities by not being able to meet the demand for our products 

table of contents wafer probe cards that do not meet specifications or that contain defects could damage our reputation  decrease market acceptance of our technology  cause us to lose customers and revenues  and result in liability to us 
the complexity and ongoing development of our wafer probe card manufacturing process  combined with increases in wafer probe card production volumes  have in the past and could in the future lead to design or manufacturing problems 
for example  the presence of contaminants in our plating baths has caused a decrease in our manufacturing yields or has resulted in unanticipated stress related failures when our wafer probe cards are being used in the manufacturing test environment 
a further example is that during our fiscal quarter ending december   we experienced a contamination problem in our manufacturing line 
this contamination problem caused a yield decline that  in turn  resulted in our inability to timely ship products to our customers 
manufacturing design errors such as the miswiring of a wafer probe card or the incorrect placement of probe contact elements have caused us to repeat manufacturing design steps 
in addition to these examples  problems might result from a number of factors  including design defects  materials failures  contamination in the manufacturing environment  impurities in the materials used  unknown sensitivities to process conditions  such as temperature and humidity  and equipment failures 
as a result  our products have in the past contained and might in the future contain undetected errors or defects 
any errors or defects could cause lower than anticipated yields and lengthening of delivery schedules  cause delays in product shipments  cause delays in new product introductions  cause us to incur warranty expenses  result in increased costs and diversion of development resources  cause us to incur increased charges due to unusable inventory  require design modifications  or decrease market acceptance or customer satisfaction with these products 
the occurrence of any one or more of these events could hurt our operating results 
in addition  if any of our products fails to meet specifications or has reliability  quality or compatibility problems  our reputation could be damaged significantly and customers might be reluctant to buy our products  which could result in a decline in revenues  an increase in product returns or warranty costs and the loss of existing customers or the failure to attract new customers 
our customers use our products with test equipment and software in their manufacturing facilities 
our products must be compatible with the customers equipment and software to form an integrated system 
if the system does not function properly  we could be required to provide field application engineers to locate the problem  which can take time and resources 
if the problem relates to our wafer probe cards  we might have to invest significant capital  manufacturing capacity and other resources to correct it 
our current or potential customers also might seek to recover from us any losses resulting from defects or failures in our products 
liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages 
if we fail to forecast demand for our products accurately  we could incur inventory losses 
each semiconductor chip design requires a custom wafer probe card 
because our products are design specific  demand for our products is difficult to forecast 
due to our customers short delivery time requirements  we often design  procure materials and  at times  produce our products in anticipation of demand for our products rather than in response to an order 
due to the uncertainty inherent in forecasts  we are  and expect to continue to be  subject to inventory risk 
if we do not obtain orders as we anticipate  we could have excess inventory for a specific customer design that we would not be able to sell to any other customer  which would likely result in inventory write offs 

table of contents if we fail to effectively manage our service centers  our business might be harmed 
in  we expanded our repair and service center in seoul  south korea 
in  we opened a repair and service center in dresden  germany 
in we opened a repair and service center in tokyo  japan 
these service centers are part of our strategy to  among other things  provide our customers with more efficient service and repair of our wafer probe cards 
if we are unable to effectively manage our service centers  do not expand or enhance our service centers to meet customer demand  or if the work undertaken in the service centers is not equivalent to the level and quality provided by repairs and services performed by our north american repair and service operations  which are part of our manufacturing facility in livermore  california  we could incur higher wafer probe card repair and service costs  which could harm our operating results 
if we do not effectively manage changes in our business  these changes could place a significant strain on our management and operations and  as a result  our business might not succeed 
our ability to grow successfully requires an effective planning and management process 
we plan to increase the scope of our operations and the size of our direct sales force domestically and internationally 
for example  we have leased a new facility in livermore  california and moved our corporate headquarters and started the transition of our manufacturing operations into this facility in our growth could place a significant strain on our management systems  infrastructure and other resources 
to manage our growth effectively  we must invest the necessary capital and continue to improve and expand our systems and infrastructure in a timely and efficient manner 
those resources might not be available when we need them  which would limit our growth 
our officers have limited experience in managing large or rapidly growing businesses 
in addition  the majority of our management has no experience in managing a public company or communicating with securities analysts and public company investors 
our controls  systems and procedures might not be adequate to support a growing public company 
if our management fails to respond effectively to changes in our business  our business might not succeed 
if we fail to attract  integrate and retain qualified personnel  our business might be harmed 
our future success depends largely upon the continued service of our key management  technical  and sales and marketing personnel  and on our continued ability to hire  integrate and retain qualified individuals  particularly engineers and sales and marketing personnel in order to increase market awareness of our products and to increase revenues 
for example  in the future  we might need technical personnel experienced in competencies that we do not currently have or require 
competition for qualified individuals may be intense  and we might not be successful in retaining our employees or attracting new personnel 
the loss of any key employee  the inability to successfully integrate replacement personnel  the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position or our inability to attract and retain skilled employees as needed could impair our ability to meet customer and technological demands 
all of our key personnel in the united states are employees at will 
we have no employment contracts with any of our personnel in the united states 
we may make acquisitions  which could put a strain on our resources  cause ownership dilution to our stockholders and adversely affect our financial results 
while we have made no acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies in the past  we may make acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies in the future 
integrating newly acquired businesses  products or technologies into our company could put a strain on our resources  could be expensive and time consuming  and might not be successful 
future acquisitions could divert our management s attention from other business concerns and expose our business to unforeseen liabilities or risks associated with entering new markets 
in addition  we might lose key employees while integrating new organizations 
consequently  we might not be successful in integrating any acquired businesses  products or technologies  and might not achieve anticipated revenues and cost benefits 
in addition  future acquisitions could result in customer dissatisfaction  performance problems with an acquired company  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities  possible impairment charges related to goodwill or other intangible assets or other unanticipated events or circumstances  any of which could harm our business 

table of contents as part of our sales process  we could incur substantial sales and engineering expenses that do not result in revenues  which would harm our operating results 
our customers generally expend significant efforts evaluating and qualifying our products prior to placing an order 
the time that our customers require to evaluate and qualify our wafer probe cards is typically between three and months and sometimes longer 
while our customers are evaluating our products  we might incur substantial sales  marketing  and research and development expenses 
for example  we typically expend significant resources educating our prospective customers regarding the uses and benefits of our wafer probe cards and developing wafer probe cards customized to the potential customer s needs  for which we might not be reimbursed 
although we commit substantial resources to our sales efforts  we might never receive any revenues from a customer 
for example  many semiconductor designs never reach production  including designs for which we have expended design effort and expense 
in addition  prospective customers might decide not to use our wafer probe cards 
the length of time that it takes for the evaluation process and for us to make a sale depends upon many factors including the efforts of our sales force and our distributor and independent sales representatives  the complexity of the customer s fabrication processes  the internal technical capabilities of the customer  and the customer s budgetary constraints and  in particular  the customer s ability to devote resources to the evaluation process 
in addition  product purchases are frequently subject to delays  particularly with respect to large customers for which our products may represent a small percentage of their overall purchases 
as a result  our sales cycles are unpredictable 
if we incur substantial sales and engineering expenses without generating revenues  our operating results could be harmed 
from time to time  we might be subject to claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights  or to claims that our intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable  which could result in significant expense and loss of intellectual property rights 
in the future  we might receive claims that we are infringing intellectual property rights of others  or claims that our patents or other intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable 
we have received in the past  and may receive in the future  communications from third parties inquiring about our interest in licensing certain of their intellectual property or more generally identifying intellectual property that may be of interest to us 
for example  we received such a communication from microelectronics and computer technology corporation in october  with a follow up letter in january  inquiring about our interest in acquiring a license to certain of their patents and technology  and from ibm corporation in february  with a follow up letter in august  inquiring about our interest and need to acquire a license to ibm patents and technology related to high density integrated probes 
we have not engaged in a dialog with microelectronics and computer technology corporation 
we have engaged in a dialog with ibm corporation regarding our companies respective intellectual property portfolios and technologies  and anticipate that this dialog will continue 
in august  subsequent to our initiating correspondence with japan electronic materials corporation regarding the scope of our intellectual property rights and the potential applicability of those rights to certain of its wafer probe cards  japan electronic materials corporation offered that precedent technologies exist as to one of our foreign patents that we had identified  and also referenced a us patent in which it stated we might take interest 
for the inquiries we have received to date  we do not believe we infringe any of the identified patents and technology 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by uncertain and conflicting intellectual property claims and vigorous protection and pursuit of these rights 
the resolution of any claims of this nature  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays 
in the event of an adverse ruling  we might be required to pay substantial damages  cease the use or sale of infringing products  spend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue the use of certain technology or enter into license agreements 
license agreements  if required  
table of contents might not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
the loss of access to any of our intellectual property or the ability to use any of our technology could harm our business 
if we fail to protect our proprietary rights  our competitors might gain access to our technology  which could adversely affect our ability to compete successfully in our markets and harm our operating results 
if we fail to protect our proprietary rights adequately  our competitors might gain access to our technology 
unauthorized parties might attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
others might independently develop similar or competing technologies or methods or design around our patents 
in addition  the laws of many foreign countries in which we or our customers do business do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
as a result  our competitors might offer similar products and we might not be able to compete successfully 
we also cannot assure that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate  patents will be issued from our currently pending or future applications  our existing patents or any new patents will be sufficient in scope or strength to provide any meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us  any patent  trademark or other intellectual property right that we own will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged in the united states or foreign countries  or others will not misappropriate our proprietary technologies or independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products or design around any patent or other intellectual property rights that we own 
we might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights 
we presently believe that it is likely that one or more of our competitors are using methodologies or have implemented structures into certain of their products that are covered by one or more of our intellectual property rights 
see the legal proceedings section of this annual report for a description of the infringement actions we have brought against phicom corporation  one of our competitors  and the invalidity proceedings that phicom has filed with the korean intellectual property office against certain of our patents 
in addition to phicom  other third parties have initiated challenges in foreign patent offices against other of our patents 
while we do not have a monetary damages exposure in these various invalidity proceedings  it is possible we will incur material expenses in our litigation with phicom or in defending our intellectual property more broadly 
any litigation  whether or not it is resolved in our favor  could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
in addition  many of our customer contracts contain provisions that require us to indemnify our customers for third party intellectual property infringement claims  which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling in such a claim 
an adverse determination could also prevent us from licensing our technologies and methods to others 
our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to significant fines and liabilities  and new laws and regulations or changes in regulatory interpretation or enforcement could make compliance more difficult and costly 
we are subject to various and frequently changing us federal  state and local  and foreign governmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment  including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water  the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes  the cleanup of contaminated sites and the maintenance of a safe workplace 
we could incur substantial costs  including cleanup costs  civil or criminal fines or sanctions and third party claims for property damage or personal injury  as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations or non compliance with the environmental permits required at our facilities 
in  the company resolved a notice of violation from the california department of toxic substances control through its corrective action and payment in the amount of  resolved a notice of 
table of contents violation from the bay area air quality management district through its corrective action and payment in the amount of  and resolved a citation and notification of penalty from the california division of occupational safety and health through its corrective action and payment in the amount of in february and april the company received a total of four notices from the city of livermore water resources division regarding violations of applicable discharge limits in relation to certain of its wastewater discharge chemical storage permits 
in march the company reported to appropriate authorities release of a fuel water mixture resulting in a notice of violation from the city of livermore water resources division 
the company believes it instituted appropriate corrective actions in all cases 
notwithstanding the company s corrective action  the notices of violation remain unresolved and the company may be subject to a penalty or additional enforcement actions based thereupon 
in august  the company reported to the appropriate authorities overflow of wastewater 
the company has not yet received any formal notices from an agency or governmental authority regarding any potential violation or notice of violation  and the matter  to date  remains unresolved 
these laws  regulations and permits also could require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions or decrease the likelihood of accidental releases of hazardous substances 
in addition  new laws and regulations  stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations  the discovery of previously unknown contamination at our or others sites or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to curtail our operations  restrict our future expansion  subject us to liability and cause us to incur future costs that would have a negative effect on our operating results and cash flow 
because we conduct some of our business internationally  we are subject to operational  economic  financial and political risks abroad 
sales of our products to customers outside the united states have accounted for an important part of our revenues 
our international sales as a percentage of our revenues were for fiscal and for fiscal in the future  we expect international sales  particularly into europe  japan  south korea and taiwan  to continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues 
accordingly  we will be subject to risks and challenges that we would not otherwise face if we conducted our business only in the united states 
these risks and challenges include compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations  legal uncertainties regarding taxes  tariffs  quotas  export controls  export licenses and other trade barriers  political and economic instability in  or foreign conflicts that involve or affect  the countries of our customers  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer accounts receivable payment cycles  difficulties in staffing and managing personnel  distributors and representatives  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  currency exchange rate fluctuations  which could affect the value of our assets denominated in local currency  as well as the price of our products relative to locally produced products  seasonal fluctuations in purchasing patterns in other countries  and fluctuations in freight rates and transportation disruptions 
any of these factors could harm our existing international operations and business or impair our ability to continue expanding into international markets 

table of contents we might require additional capital to support business growth  and such capital might not be available 
we intend to continue to make investments to support business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges  which include the need to develop new products or enhance existing products  enhance our operating infrastructure and acquire complementary businesses and technologies 
accordingly  we may need to engage in equity or debt financing to secure additional funds 
equity and debt financing  however  might not be available when needed or  if available  might not be available on terms satisfactory to us 
if we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us  our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited 
our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board  the american institute of certified public accountants  the securities and exchange commission and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles 
a change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results  and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change 
the sarbanes oxley act of and related changes in securities laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of that became law in july  as well as new rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the securities and exchange commission  have required changes to some of our corporate governance practices 
the act also required us to implement additional disclosure and financial controls 
these rules and regulations have increased and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs  and to make some activities more difficult  time consuming and or costly 
we also expect these new rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
these new rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  particularly to serve on our audit committee  and qualified executive officers 
unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions  and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses in different jurisdictions 
our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates  changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes in tax laws including pending tax law changes such as the benefit from export sales and the research and development credit  and by material audit assessments 
in particular  the carrying value of deferred tax assets  which are predominantly in the united states  is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states 
in addition  the amount of income taxes we pay could be subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability 
the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile  and you might not be able to sell your shares at or above the price that you paid for them 
the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile  and from the date of our initial public offering in june through december   our stock price has ranged from a share to a share 
accordingly  the trading price of our common stock is likely to be subject to wide 
table of contents fluctuations 
further  our securities have a limited trading history 
factors affecting the trading price of our common stock include variations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations  new products or product enhancements  strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors  recruitment or departure of key personnel  the gain or loss of significant orders or customers  changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock  market conditions in our industry  the industries of our customers and the economy as a whole  and sales or perceived sales of substantial amounts of our common stock held by existing stockholders 
in addition  if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences continued or greater loss of investor confidence  the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business  operating results or financial condition 
the trading price of our common stock also might decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us 
if securities analysts do not publish or stop publishing research or reports about our business  our stock price could decline 
the trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business 
we do not control these analysts 
if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock  our stock price would likely decline rapidly 
if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company  we could lose visibility in the market  which in turn could cause our stock price to decline 
if securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business  our stock price could decline 
the concentration of our capital stock ownership with insiders will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters 
our executive officers  directors  current or greater stockholders and entities affiliated with any of them together beneficially own a large percentage of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these stockholders  acting together  have substantial influence over all matters that require approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
as a result  corporate actions might be taken even if other stockholders  including you  oppose them 
this concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that other stockholders may view as beneficial 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws or delaware law might discourage  delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and  therefore  depress the trading price of our common stock 
delaware corporate law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous 
these provisions establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time  provide that directors may only be removed for cause and only with the approval of of our stockholders  require super majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  
table of contents authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt  limit the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  prohibit stockholder action by written consent  which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders  provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make  alter or repeal our bylaws  and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
in addition  section of the delaware general corporation law may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company 
in addition  on december   our compensation committee approved entering into change of control severance agreements with each of its named executive officers and certain other executives 
the company adopted these agreements as part of its review of compensation and benefits of the company 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
our revenues  except in japan  and our expenses  except those expenses related to our operations in germany  united kingdom  japan and korea operations  are denominated in us dollars 
revenues and accounts receivable from our japanese customers are denominated in japanese yen 
we may purchase from time to time forward exchange contracts to hedge certain existing foreign currency denominated receivable 
gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in income when the related transactions being hedged are recognized 
as of december   we had outstanding foreign currency exchange forward contracts to sell  yen for  with contract rates ranging from yen to yen per us dollar 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates throughout fiscal and the unrealized loss or fair value on these contracts totaled  as of december  and was recognized in income 
the fair value on these foreign currency forward exchange contracts as of december  would have changed by  if the foreign currency exchange rate for the japanese yen to the us dollar on these forward contracts had changed by 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with an interest rate fixed at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  and marketable securities in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities and certificates of deposit see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a change in interest rates will have a significant impact on our interest income 
as of december   all of our investments were in money market accounts  certificates of deposit or high quality corporate debt obligations and us government securities
