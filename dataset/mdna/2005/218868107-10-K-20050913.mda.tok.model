table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report on form k 
restatement of previously issued consolidated financial statements since its inception in  corinthian colleges  inc the company recognized revenue pro rata  calculated on a monthly basis for its diploma programs at schools utilizing the company s original student information system 
in certain schools acquired by the company since that time where the existing information technology systems were also acquired  however  the company maintained the daily calculation methodology for pro rata revenue recognition that was used in those schools prior to the acquisition 
accordingly  for the last several years  the company maintained more than one method to calculate pro rata revenue recognition across its system of schools with diploma programs 
in the monthly revenue recognition schools  the company recognized a full month of revenue during the first month of attendance for each student  regardless of when the student started during the month 
additionally  certain diploma programs require externships to be taken following the conclusion of in school instruction in order to satisfy graduation requirements 
for these programs  the company has recognized revenue only over the period of in school instruction 
following a review of these accounting policies  and taking into consideration the requirements of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and in consultation with the company s independent registered public accounting firm  ernst young llp  on august   the company s management and the audit committee of its board of directors concluded that the accounting policies to recognize revenue on a monthly basis and only over the period of in school instruction should be changed 
accordingly  the company s management and audit committee determined that previously filed financial statements for the fiscal years through and for the first three quarters of fiscal should be restated 
the company has restated its financial statements for schools previously recognizing revenue on a monthly basis to adopt a mid month convention for revenue recognition whereby only a half month of revenue is recognized in both the initial month and the final month of attendance for students in diploma programs 
additionally  the company will recognize tuition revenue through the end of each student s externship period 
these changes in our revenue recognition policy resulted in a reduction in revenue for fiscal years ended and of million and million  respectively 
the restatement resulted in a corresponding reduction in diluted net earnings per share of and for the fiscal years ended and  respectively 
please refer to note of our accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of the impact of the restatement on our financial statements as of june   and for each of the two years then ended  and to note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of the impact of the restatement on our previously reported quarterly financial information in fiscal years  and amounts previously reported for prior dates and periods that are included in the accompanying five year summary of selected financial data are as follows year ended june  in thousands balance sheet data working capital total assets total stockholders equity 
table of contents in thousands  except per share data statement of income data total revenue income from operations net income basic  net income per share diluted  net income per share background and overview as of june   we operated colleges and training centers  with more than  students  in states and canadian provinces 
during the fiscal year ended june   the company had net revenues of million 
our revenues consist principally of student tuition and fees and are presented as net revenues after adjustments for refunds related to students who do not complete their courses 
we recognize revenues pro rata on a straight line basis over the relevant period attended by the student of the applicable course or program 
net revenues increased to million in from million in the increase was largely the result of a increase in average student population and a increase in average tuition rate per student during the period 
tuition revenues  which represented of fiscal total net revenues  fluctuate with the aggregate enrolled student population and the average program or credit hour charge 
the student population varies depending on  among other factors  the number of i continuing students at the beginning of a fiscal period  ii new student enrollments during the fiscal period  iii students who have previously withdrawn but who reenter during the fiscal period  and iv graduations and withdrawals during the fiscal period 
new student starts typically occur several times per month in the diploma granting colleges 
in the degree granting colleges  the majority of new student starts occur in the first month of each calendar quarter with an additional mini start in the second month of each quarter in most colleges 
the tuition charges vary by college depending on the local market  the program level diploma  associate s  bachelor s or master s degree and the specific curriculum 
the majority of students at our colleges rely on funds received under various government sponsored student financial aid programs to pay a substantial portion of their tuition and other education related expenses 
in fiscal  approximately of our net revenues  on a cash basis  were derived from federal student financial aid programs 
we categorize our expenses as educational services  general and administrative  and marketing and admissions 
educational services expenses primarily consist of those costs incurred to deliver and administer the education programs at the colleges  including faculty and college administration compensation  education materials and supplies  college facility rent and other occupancy costs  bad debt expense  bookstore and classroom expenses  depreciation and amortization of college property and equipment  default management expenses and financial aid processing costs 
general and administrative expenses consist principally of those costs incurred at the corporate and regional level in support of college operations  except for marketing and admissions related costs 
included in general and administrative expenses are costs relating to executive management  corporate staff and regional operations management compensation  rent and other occupancy costs for corporate headquarters  depreciation and amortization of corporate property and equipment and certain intangibles  and other expenses incurred at corporate headquarters 
additionally  all bonus and other incentive compensation expenses are included in general and administrative expenses 
marketing and admissions expenses include compensation for college admissions staff  regional admissions personnel  compensation expenses for marketing management  and all direct marketing and production costs 
we expense advertising costs as incurred 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts on those financial statements 
note to the consolidated financial statements in the annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended june  describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to our allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill and intangible assets  deferred taxes  contingencies and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or if our assumptions change 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition 
revenues consist primarily of tuition and fees derived from courses taught in our colleges  schools  and training centers 
revenues from tuition and fees are recognized pro rata on a straight line basis over the relevant period attended by the student of the applicable course or program 
if a student withdraws from a course or program  the paid but unearned portion of the student s tuition is refunded 
textbook sales and other revenues are recognized as sales occur or services are performed and represent less than of total revenues 
prepaid tuition is the portion of payments received but not earned and is reflected as a current liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as this amount is expected to be earned within the next year 
for the corporate education services in our pegasus division we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method for long duration service contracts and as services are provided for short duration programs 
students attending our post secondary institutions enroll in either i diploma programs  which cover a specific area of training over a discrete length of time averaging nine months for such programs or ii courses leading to an associate s  bachelor s or master s degree 
costs of programs or credit hours for courses are clearly identified in our enrollment agreements 
at the start of each student s respective program or courses of study leading to a degree  the student executes an enrollment agreement which specifies the field of study  the expected length of study  and the cost of the program or courses 
we recognize revenue from tuition and fees on a straight line basis over the relevant period attended by the student of the applicable course or program of study 
if a student withdraws from an institution  we cease the recognition of revenue and the paid but unearned portion of the student s tuition is refunded 
additionally  to ensure the delivery of education has occurred  either attendance is taken or academic events are conducted at appropriate intervals to ensure that the student is completing his or her respective field of study within the acceptable time period 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability  failure or refusal of our students to make required payments 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly reviewing the accounts receivable aging and applying various expected loss percentages to certain student accounts receivable categories based upon historical bad debt experience 
we generally write off accounts receivable balances deemed uncollectible as they are sent to collection agencies 
we offer a variety of payment plans to help students pay that portion of their education expense not covered by financial aid programs 
these balances are unsecured and not guaranteed 
we believe our reserves are adequate  however  losses related to unpaid student balances could exceed the amounts we have reserved for bad debts 
many of our students in the us participate in federally guaranteed student loan programs 
the federally guaranteed student loans are authorized by the higher education act hea of and are guaranteed by an agency of the federal government 
the guaranteed loans are not guaranteed by us  and the 
table of contents guaranteed student loans cannot become an obligation of ours 
accordingly  we do not record an obligation to repay any of the guaranteed loans that are not repaid by our former students and we do not record either a contingent obligation or an allowance for future obligations as a result of student defaults of federally guaranteed student loans 
the guarantee of student loans is provided by an agency of the federal government  not by us 
if an institution s former students default rate on guaranteed loans cohort default rate equals or exceeds for three consecutive years  the institution may lose participation eligibility in the guaranteed loan program and its students would be denied access to the guaranteed loan program 
our institutions cohort default rates act as a gatekeeper to their eligibility to participate in the federal student financial aid programs 
we have no obligation to repay any of the federally guaranteed loans that our former students default upon  even if the cohort default rates of our students exceed permitted levels 
rather  if the cohort default rates at a particular institution exceed for three consecutive years  the institution s students may lose eligibility to receive federal student financial aid 
goodwill and intangible assets 
we have significant goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired  including identified intangible assets 
we consider a number of factors  including valuations and appraisals from independent valuation firms  in determining the amounts that are assignable to other intangible assets  such as curriculum  accreditation  and trade names 
we  however  are ultimately responsible for the valuations 
the fair value of identified intangible assets is derived using accepted valuation methodologies  including cost  market  and income approaches  as appropriate  following consultations with valuation firms and in accordance with sfas no 
and requirements set forth by the uniform standards of professional appraisal practice 
effective july   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

this standard changed the accounting for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
as of july   we ceased amortization of goodwill recorded in conjunction with past business combinations 
in addition  we conducted a review of our other identifiable intangible assets and determined that accreditation and trade names met the indefinite life criteria outlined in sfas no 
our review considered analysis of all pertinent factors  including the expected use of the asset  any legal  regulatory  or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life  the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition  and other economic factors  and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset 
accordingly  we also ceased amortization of the accreditation and trade names as of july  curricula continue to be amortized over their useful lives ranging generally from three to ten years and the amortization is included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
under sfas no 
 goodwill is tested annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment  by comparing its fair value to its carrying amount at the reporting unit level as defined by sfas no 
we determined the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach of valuation that includes discounted cash flow as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies 
to the extent the fair value of a reporting unit is less that the carrying amount of its assets  we record an impairment charge in the consolidated statements of operations 
also  under sfas no 
 indefinite lived intangible assets are tested annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment  by comparing their fair values to their carrying amounts 
to the extent the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount  we record an impairment charge in the consolidated statements of operations 
for instance  if we were to discontinue the use of a trade name or lose accreditation at one or more of our acquired schools to which we have ascribed value for trade names and accreditation  we would test the amounts we have allocated to such assets for impairment 
such testing would include estimating the future cash flows expected to be received from the trade names and accreditation and comparing them to their carrying values 
if our estimate of the present value of these future cash flows were below the carrying values of the related assets  we would consider the assets to be impaired and take a charge against the amounts we had allocated to trade names and accreditation 

table of contents the determination of related estimated useful lives of intangible assets and whether or not these intangible assets are impaired involves significant judgment 
although we believe our goodwill and intangible assets are fairly stated  changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to asset balances 
deferred taxes 
we currently have deferred income tax assets which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that more likely than not will be realized 
realization of our deferred income tax assets is principally dependent upon achievement of projected future taxable income offset by deferred income tax liabilities 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred income tax assets annually 
contingencies 
in the ordinary conduct of the business  we are subject to occasional lawsuits  investigations and claims  including  but not limited to  claims involving students and graduates and routine employment matters 
when we are aware of a claim or potential claim  we assess the likelihood of any loss or exposure 
if it is probable that a loss will result and the amount of the loss can reasonably estimated  we record a liability for the loss 
if the loss is not probable or the amount of the loss cannot be reasonably estimated  we disclose the nature of the specific claim if the likelihood of a potential loss is reasonably possible and the amount involved is material 
there can be no assurance that the ultimate outcome of any of the matters disclosed will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and have adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  related to options issued to employees and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
all stock options  stock appreciation rights or other common stock based securities granted are accounted for under fixed accounting and have an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r requires companies to measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in its consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the adoption of sfas no 
r requires additional accounting and disclosure related to the income tax and cash flow effects resulting from share based payment arrangements 
sfas no 
r is effective beginning as of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  accordingly  the adoption of statement no 
r s fair value method will have a significant impact on the company s result of operations  although it will have no impact on its overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  if the company had adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption

table of contents seasonality and other factors affecting quarterly results our revenues normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business 
student population varies as a result of new student enrollments and student attrition 
historically  our colleges  schools and training centers have had lower student populations in the first fiscal quarter than in the remainder of the year 
our expenses  however  do not vary as significantly as student population and revenues 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results to continue as a result of seasonal enrollment patterns 
such patterns may change  however  as a result of acquisitions  new branch openings  new program adoptions and increased enrollments from recent high school graduates 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period

leases the company currently leases almost all of its administrative and educational facilities under operating lease agreements 
on february   the office of the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission ocasec issued a letter to the american institute of certified public accountants expressing its views regarding certain operating lease accounting issues and their application under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
in light of this letter  the company initiated a review of its lease related accounting and determined that its previous method of accounting for leasehold improvements funded by landlord incentives or allowances under operating leases tenant improvement allowances was not in accordance with the guidance provided by ocasec 
the company has historically accounted for tenant improvement allowances as reductions to the related leasehold improvement asset on the consolidated balance sheets and capital expenditures in investing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows 
management determined that the appropriate interpretation of financial accounting standards board fasb technical bulletin no 
 issues relating to accounting for leases  requires these allowances to be recorded as a deferred rent liability on the consolidated balance sheets and as a component of operating activities on the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows 
as a result of these reclassifications  the purchases of leasehold improvements and related amortization expense will increase and will be offset by a corresponding increase in the deferred rent liability and a reduction in rent expense for all periods presented 
there is no impact on the consolidated statements of operations as a result of this reclassification 
in fiscal  the company reclassified million and million of unamortized tenant improvement allowances from leasehold improvements to other long term liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets as of june  and  respectively 
in addition  the company reclassified million and million  during fiscal and  respectively in the consolidated statements of cash flows from purchases of property and equipment included in investing activities to depreciation and amortization expense and other liabilities included in operating activities 
these reclassifications did not have a material effect on the prior periods

during fiscal  cash provided by financing activities consisted of proceeds from borrowings of million and proceeds from the exercises of stock options of million  partially offset by the payments on long term debt including capital lease obligations of million 
we believe that our working capital  cash flow from operations  access to operating leases and borrowings available from our amended credit agreement will provide us with adequate resources for our ongoing operations through fiscal and our currently identified and planned capital expenditures 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations as of june   future minimum cash payments due under contractual obligations  including our credit agreement  mortgages  and non cancelable operating and capital lease agreements  are as follows payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total the united states doe requires that title iv program funds collected in advance of student billings be kept in a separate cash or cash equivalent account until the students are billed for the program portion related to those funds 
in addition  all title iv program funds received by our schools through electronic funds transfer are subject to certain holding period restrictions 
these funds are also deposited into a separate account until the restrictions are satisfied 
as of june   we held nominal amounts of such funds in separate accounts 
the restrictions on any cash held have not significantly affected our ability to fund daily operations 

table of contents risks related to our business risks related to extensive regulation of our business if we fail to follow extensive regulatory requirements for our business  we could suffer severe fines and penalties  including loss of access to federal student loans and grants for our students 
we derive a majority of our revenues on a cash basis from federal student financial aid programs 
to participate in such programs an institution must obtain and maintain authorization by the appropriate state agencies  accreditation by an accrediting agency recognized by the doe  and certification by the doe 
as a result  our schools are subject to extensive regulation by these agencies that  among other things  requires us to undertake steps to assure that our schools do not have cohort default rates of or more for three consecutive cohort years  limit the percentage of revenues on a cash basis derived at each of our institutions from federal student financial aid programs to less than adhere to financial responsibility and administrative capability standards  prohibit the payment of certain incentives to personnel engaged in student recruiting  admissions activities or awarding financial aid  achieve stringent completion and placement outcomes for short term programs  and make timely refunds of tuition when a student withdraws from one of our institutions 
these regulations also affect our ability to acquire or open additional schools or change our corporate structure 
these regulatory agencies periodically revise their requirements and modify their interpretations of existing requirements 
if one or more of our schools were to violate any of these regulatory requirements  we could suffer fines  penalties or other sanctions  including the loss of our ability to participate in federal student financial aid programs at those schools  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we cannot predict how all of these requirements will be applied  or whether we will be able to comply with all of the requirements in the future 
some of the most significant regulatory requirements and risks that apply to our schools are described in the following paragraphs 
the us congress may change the law or reduce funding for federal student financial aid programs  which could harm our business 
congress regularly reviews and revises the laws governing the federal student financial aid programs and annually determines the funding level for each of these programs 
any action by congress that significantly reduces funding for the federal student financial aid programs or the ability of our schools or students to participate in these programs could harm our business 
legislative action may also increase our administrative costs and burdens and require us to modify our practices in order for our schools to comply fully with applicable requirements  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
congress is currently reviewing the reauthorization of hea  which provides for federal student financial aid programs 
congress must reauthorize the student financial assistance programs of the hea approximately every five to six years  and the last reauthorization took place in approximately of our revenues on a cash basis are derived from federal student financial aid programs 
it is uncertain what changes  if any  congress may ultimately make to the hea as a result of reauthorization 
as in previous reauthorizations  we believe that following reauthorization of hea our students will have access to federal student financial aid programs 
however  any action by congress that significantly reduces funding for the federal student financial aid programs or the ability of our schools or students to participate in these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business 
legislative action may also increase our administrative costs and require us to modify our practices in order for our schools to comply fully with applicable requirements 

table of contents if we do not meet specific financial responsibility ratios and tests established by the doe  our us schools may lose eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs 
to participate in the federal student financial aid programs  an institution must either satisfy quantitative standards of financial responsibility  or post a letter of credit in favor of the doe and possibly accept other conditions on its participation in the federal student financial aid programs 
each year  based on financial information submitted by institutions that participate in federal student financial aid programs  the doe calculates three financial ratios for an institution an equity ratio  a primary reserve ratio and a net income ratio 
each of these ratios is scored separately and then combined to determine the institution s financial responsibility 
if an institution s score is above  it may continue its participation in federal student financial aid programs 
for fiscal  our calculations show that all of our schools exceed this requirement on an individual basis and are eligible to participate in the federal student financial aid programs  with composite scores ranging from to on a consolidated basis  we also exceed this requirement with the composite score of 
we cannot assure you that we and our institutions will continue to satisfy the numeric standards in the future 
our us schools may lose eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs if the percentage of their revenues derived from those programs is too high 
a proprietary institution loses its eligibility to participate in the federal student financial aid programs for a period of one year if it derives more than of its revenues  on a cash basis  from these programs in any fiscal year 
any institution that violates this rule immediately becomes ineligible to participate in federal student financial aid programs and is ineligible to reapply to regain its eligibility until the following fiscal year 
based on our calculations  none of our institutions received more than of its revenues  on a cash basis  in fiscal  with our highest institution receiving of its revenues  on a cash basis  from federal student financial aid programs 
on a consolidated basis  we received of our revenues  on a cash basis  from federal student financial aid programs in fiscal if any of our institutions  depending on its size  loses eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our us schools may lose eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs if their current and former students loan default rates on federally guaranteed student loans made by third parties are too high 
an institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all of the federal student financial aid programs if defaults by its former students on their federally guaranteed student loans funded by third parties equal or exceed per year for three consecutive years 
for federal fiscal year  the last year for which final rates have been published  default rates for our institutions range from a low of to a high of 
we review all annually published cohort default rates and appeal the rates we believe are inaccurate 
if any of our institutions  depending on its size  were to lose eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs because of high student loan default rates  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
one or more of our institutions may have to post a letter of credit or be subject to other sanctions if they do not correctly calculate and timely return title iv program funds for students who withdraw before completing their program of study 
a school participating in title iv programs must correctly calculate the amount of unearned title iv program funds that was disbursed to students who withdrew from their educational programs before completing them  and must return those unearned funds in a timely manner  generally within days of the date the school determines that the student has withdrawn 
if the unearned funds are not properly calculated and timely returned  we may have to post a letter of credit in favor of the doe or be otherwise sanctioned by the doe 
an institution is required to post a letter of credit with the doe in an amount equal to of the total dollar amount of unearned title iv program funds that the institution was required to return with respect to withdrawn students during its most recently completed fiscal year  if the institution was found in an audit or program review to have untimely returned unearned title iv program funds with respect to or more of the students in the audit or 
table of contents program review sample of withdrawn students  in either of its two most recently completed fiscal years 
the requirement to post a letter of credit or other sanctions by the doe could increase our cost of regulatory compliance and adversely affect our results of operations 
if regulators do not approve our acquisitions  the acquired school s would not be permitted to participate in federal student financial aid programs 
when we acquire an institution that participates in federal student financial aid programs  we must seek approval from the doe and most applicable state agencies and accrediting agencies  because an acquisition is considered a change of ownership or control of the acquired institution under applicable regulatory standards 
a change of ownership or control of an institution under the doe standards can result in the temporary suspension of the institution s participation in the federal student financial aid programs unless a timely and materially complete application for recertification is filed with the doe and the doe issues a temporary certification document 
if we are unable to obtain approvals from the state agencies  accrediting agencies or doe for any institution we have acquired or will acquire  depending on the size of that acquisition  such a failure to obtain approval could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if regulators do not approve transactions involving a change of control or change in our corporate structure  we may lose our ability to participate in federal student financial aid programs 
additionally  if regulators do not approve transactions involving a change of control of the company or any schools that we acquire  we may lose our ability to participate in federal student financial aid programs 
if we or any of our institutions experience a change of control under the standards of applicable state agencies or accrediting agencies or the doe  we or the affected institutions must seek the approval of the relevant agencies 
some of these transactions or events  such as a significant acquisition or disposition of our common stock  may be beyond our control 
the adverse regulatory effect of a change of ownership resulting in a change of control could also discourage bids for our outstanding shares of common stock at a premium and could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
if any of our us schools fails to maintain its accreditation or its state authorization  that institution may lose its ability to participate in federal student financial aid programs 
an institution that grants degrees  diplomas or certificates must be authorized by the relevant agencies of the state in which it is located and  in some cases  other states 
requirements for authorization vary substantially among the states 
additionally  both an approval to operate in a state and accreditation by an accrediting agency recognized by the doe are required for an institution to participate in the federal student financial aid programs 
if any of our u 
s 
campuses were to lose its accreditation or its state authorization  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we fail to demonstrate administrative capability to the doe  our business could suffer 
doe regulations specify extensive criteria an institution must satisfy to establish that it has the requisite administrative capability to participate in federal student financial aid programs 
these criteria require  among other things  that the institution comply with all applicable federal student financial aid regulations  have capable and sufficient personnel to administer the federal student financial aid programs  have acceptable methods of defining and measuring the satisfactory academic progress of its students  provide financial aid counseling to its students  and submit all reports and financial statements required by the regulations 

table of contents if an institution fails to satisfy any of these criteria  the doe may require the repayment of federal student financial aid funds  transfer the institution from the advance system of payment of federal student financial aid funds to the reimbursement system of payment or cash monitoring  place the institution on provisional certification status  or commence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit  suspend or terminate the participation of the institution in federal student financial aid programs 
should one or more of our institutions be limited in their access to  or lose  federal student financial aid funds due to their failure to demonstrate administrative capability  our business could be materially adversely affected 
regulatory agencies or third parties may commence investigations  bring claims or institute litigation against us 
because we operate in a highly regulated industry  we may be subject from time to time to investigations  claims of non compliance  or lawsuits by governmental agencies or third parties  which may allege statutory violations  regulatory infractions  or common law causes of action 
if the results of the investigations are unfavorable to us or if we are unable to successfully defend against third party lawsuits  we may be required to pay money damages or be subject to fines  penalties  injunctions or other censure that could have a materially adverse effect on our business 
even if we adequately address the issues raised by an agency investigation or successfully defend a third party lawsuit  we may have to devote significant money and management resources to address these issues  which could harm our business 
in particular  the securities litigation currently pending against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors could demand significant management time and financial resources to defend and could adversely affect our business 
adverse publicity regarding litigation against us could also negatively affect our business 
investigations  claims and actions against companies in our industry could adversely affect our business and stock price 
in and  several companies in the for profit postsecondary education industry were subject to increased regulatory scrutiny 
in some cases  allegations of wrongdoing have resulted in reviews or investigations by the justice department  the securities and exchange commission  the doe  state agencies  accrediting agencies and other entities 
these allegations  reviews and investigations and the accompanying adverse publicity could have a negative impact on the for profit postsecondary education industry in general  our business and the market price of our common stock 
we are subject to sanctions if we pay impermissible commissions  bonuses or other incentive payments to individuals involved in certain recruiting  admissions or financial aid activities 
an institution participating in title iv programs may not provide any commission  bonus or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid to any person or entity engaged in any student recruitment or admission activity or in making decisions regarding the awarding of title iv program funds 
the law and regulations governing this requirement do not establish clear criteria for compliance in all circumstances 
if the doe determined that one of our institution s compensation practices violated these standards  the doe could subject the institution to monetary fines  penalties  or other sanctions 
any substantial fine or penalty or other sanction levied against one or more of our schools could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents failure to comply with extensive canadian regulations could affect the ability of our canadian schools to participate in canadian financial aid programs 
our post secondary schools in canada derive a significant percentage of their revenue on a cash basis from canadian governmental financial aid programs 
depending on their province of residence  our canadian students may receive loans under various student financial aid programs 
our canadian schools must meet eligibility standards to administer these programs and must comply with extensive statutes  rules  regulations and requirements 
if our canadian schools cannot meet these and other eligibility standards or fail to comply with applicable requirements  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
additionally  the canadian and various provincial governments continuously review the legislative  regulatory and other requirements relating to student financial assistance programs due to political and budgetary pressures 
although we do not currently anticipate a significant reduction in the funding for these programs  any change that significantly reduces funding or the ability of our schools to participate in these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation 
operational risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business if students fail to pay their outstanding balances  our business will be harmed 
we offer a variety of payment plans to help students pay that portion of their education expense not covered by financial aid programs 
these balances are unsecured and not guaranteed 
losses related to unpaid student balances in excess of the amounts we have reserved for bad debts could have a material adverse effect on our business 
failure to effectively manage our growth could harm our business 
we have grown our revenues rapidly since we formed our company in our rapid growth  now or in the future  could place a strain on our management  operations  employees or resources 
we cannot assure our stockholders that we will be able to maintain or accelerate our current growth rate  maintain our current profitability  effectively manage our existing operations or achieve planned growth on a timely or profitable basis 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  including the expenses associated with such growth  our business could be materially adversely affected 
if we cannot effectively identify  acquire and integrate additional schools  it could harm our business 
we expect to continue to rely on acquisitions as a key component of our growth strategy 
we often engage in evaluations of  and discussions with  possible acquisition candidates 
we cannot make assurances that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or that we will be able to acquire any of the acquisition candidates on favorable terms 
furthermore  we cannot make assurances that any acquired schools can be successfully integrated into our operations or be operated profitably 
acquisitions involve a number of risks that include diversion of management resources  integration of the acquired schools operations  adverse short term effects on reported operating results  and possible loss of key employees 
continued growth through acquisitions may also subject us to unanticipated business or regulatory uncertainties or liabilities 
when we acquire an existing school  we typically allocate a significant portion of the 
table of contents purchase price to fixed assets  curriculum  goodwill and intangibles  such as covenants not to compete  trade names and accreditations 
for our acquisitions through fiscal  we amortized goodwill and trade names over a period of years and curricula over to years 
effective july   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for business combinations  goodwill and other intangible assets  in its entirety 
under sfas  goodwill is no longer amortized on a periodic basis  but instead is subject to an impairment test to be performed at least on an annual basis 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
in addition  our acquisition of a school is a change of ownership of that school  which may result in the temporary suspension of that school s participation in federal student financial aid programs until it obtains the doe s approval 
if we fail to successfully manage our acquisitions  our business would likely suffer 
failure to effectively manage opening new schools and adding new services could harm our business 
establishing new schools requires us to make investments in management  capital expenditures  marketing expenses and other resources 
to open a new school  we are also required to obtain appropriate state and accrediting agency approvals 
in addition  to be eligible for federal student financial aid programs  the new school is required to be certified as eligible to receive title iv funds by the doe 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully open new schools in the future 
our failure to effectively manage the operations of newly established schools could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain key personnel 
we depend on key personnel  including david g 
moore  jack d 
massimino  beth a 
wilson  kenneth s 
ord  william b 
buchanan  mary h 
barry  mark l 
pelesh  robert c 
owen and stan a 
mortensen  to effectively operate our business 
if any of these people left our company and we failed to effectively manage a transition to new people  our business could suffer 
our success also depends  in large part  upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified faculty  school presidents and administrators and corporate management 
we may have difficulty locating and hiring qualified personnel  and retaining such personnel once hired 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel  or our failure to attract and retain other qualified and experienced personnel on acceptable terms  could cause our business to suffer 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could make an acquisition of our company difficult 
our certificate of incorporation  our by laws and delaware law contain provisions that may delay  defer or inhibit a future acquisition of our company not approved by our board of directors 
these provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with and obtain the approval of our board of directors 
our certificate of incorporation also permits our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock with voting  conversion and other rights as it determines  without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
by using preferred stock  we could discourage a proxy contest  make the acquisition of a substantial block of our common stock more difficult  or limit the price investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
we face litigation that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we and some of our current and former directors and executive officers have been named as defendants in private securities class action lawsuits 
between july  and august   several putative class action 
table of contents lawsuits were filed against us in the united states district court for the central district of california  alleging that we made certain material misrepresentations and failed to disclose certain material facts about our condition and prospects 
those cases have now been consolidated into one action 
although we believe this consolidated lawsuit is without merit  we cannot predict its outcome 
additionally  in the ordinary conduct of our business  we and our schools are subject to various other lawsuits  investigations and claims  covering a wide range of matters  including  but not limited to  claims involving our current and former students and routine employment matters 
it is possible that we may be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs in excess of our insurance coverage or current reserves  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operation 
we could also incur substantial legal costs  and management s attention and resources could be diverted from our business 
please see item  legal proceedings  for more detailed information on these litigation risks 
failure to keep pace with changing market needs and technology could harm our business 
prospective employers of our graduates increasingly demand that their entry level employees possess appropriate technological skills 
educational programs at our schools  particularly programs in information technology  must keep pace with these evolving requirements 
if we cannot respond to changes in industry requirements  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
competitors with greater resources could harm our business 
the post secondary education market is highly competitive  and has become ever more so over the past several years 
our schools compete with traditional public and private two year and four year colleges and universities and other proprietary schools  including those that offer on line learning programs 
some public and private colleges and universities  as well as other private career oriented schools  may offer programs similar to those of our schools 
although tuition at many private non profit institutions is higher than tuition at our schools  some public institutions are able to charge lower tuition than our schools  due in part to government subsidies  government and foundation grants  tax deductible contributions and other financial sources not available to proprietary schools 
some of our competitors in both the public and private sectors have substantially greater financial and other resources than us 
failure to obtain additional capital in the future could reduce our ability to grow 
we believe that funds from operations  cash  investments and access to approximately million of our million amended credit agreement as of june  that expires in august will be adequate to fund our currently identified plans 
however  we may need additional debt or equity financing in order to carry out our strategy of growth through acquisitions 
the amount and timing of such additional financing will vary principally depending on the timing and size of acquisitions and the sellers willingness to provide financing themselves 
to the extent that we require additional financing in the future and are unable to obtain such additional financing  we may not be able to fully implement our growth strategy 
if natural disasters  terrorist attacks  public transit strikes or economic downturns occur in specific geographic areas where we have a high concentration of schools  our business could be harmed 
we have large numbers of schools concentrated in certain geographic areas 
for instance  we have a high concentration of schools in california  florida  texas  georgia  michigan  the province of ontario and other states  provinces and cities 
we expect to continue to have high concentrations of schools in large metropolitan areas as we create new branch campuses and acquire new schools 
these geographic concentrations may change or intensify over time 
if natural disasters  terrorist attacks  public transit strikes  economic developments or other adverse events occur or are more intensively felt in some of these concentrated geographic areas  our business and results of operations could be disproportionately affected compared to the rest of the united states and canada 
in that regard  we have a school in new orleans  louisiana and a financial aid compliance office in 
table of contents gulfport  mississippi 
we also utilize the services of a third party financial aid processor whose main operations are located in gulfport  mississippi 
hurricane katrina in august and september displaced many of our students and employees in those locations  as well as many employees of our financial aid processor 
additionally  we expect our leased facility in new orleans to be unavailable for use for at least several months 
the lost revenue and additional expenses associated with this disaster and its effect on our students  employees  business partners and facilities may have an adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
we do not utilize interest rate swaps  forward or option contracts on foreign currencies or commodities  or other types of derivative financial instruments to manage these risks 
interest rate exposure 
as of june   our only assets or liabilities subject to risks from interest rate changes are i mortgage debt and debt under the credit facility in the aggregate amount of million and capital lease obligations of million  and ii student notes receivable  net  in the aggregate amount of million 
our mortgage debt  capital lease obligations and student notes receivable are all at fixed interest rates 
we do not believe we are subject to material risks from reasonably possible near term changes in market interest rates 
foreign currency exposure 
a portion of our operations consists of an investment in a foreign subsidiary whose functional currency is the canadian dollar 
our investment in our foreign operations as of june  was approximately cad million and we had borrowings outstanding under the credit facility of approximately cad million 
as a result  the consolidated financial results have been and could continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates
