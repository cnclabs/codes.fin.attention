results of operations fiscal year compared with fiscal year fiscal net sales decreased to million  compared with million in fiscal the net loss in fiscal was million  compared with a net loss of million in fiscal turbine component services and repair group repair group net sales in fiscal decreased to million  compared with million in fiscal component manufacturing and repair net sales decreased million to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal demand for precision component machining and for component repairs for industrial and large aerospace turbine engines decreased  while the demand for component repairs for small aerospace turbine engines increased in fiscal compared with fiscal net sales associated with the demand for replacement parts  which often complement component repair services provided to customers  decreased million to in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal during fiscal  the repair group s selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales  in fiscal included in the million of selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were million related to severance charges 
the remaining selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were million  or of net sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal benefited from a million reduction in expenses related to the closure of the repair group s tampa  florida facility 
the repair group s operating loss in fiscal increased million to a million loss from a million loss in fiscal operating results decreased in fiscal principally due to the negative impact on margins of decreased sales volumes for component manufacturing and repair services  which was partially offset by higher margins on sales of replacement parts 
the higher margins on sales of replacement parts was attributable to both improved market prices for such components as well as certain replacement part sales consisting of inventory that had been previously written down 
during fiscal  the euro strengthened against the us dollar 
the euro continued to be strong in relation to the us dollar during fiscal the repair group s non us operation has most of its sales denominated in us dollars while a significant portion of its operating costs are denominated in euros 
therefore  as the euro strengthens  costs denominated in euros are negatively impacted 
during fiscal  the repair group hedged most of its exposure to the euro thereby mitigating the negative impact on its operating results in that period 
if it had not hedged such exposure  the impact on the repair group s operating results in fiscal would have been higher operating costs of approximately million related to its non us operations 
aerospace component manufacturing group acm group net sales in fiscal increased to million  compared with million in fiscal for purposes of the following discussion  the acm group considers aircraft that can accommodate less than passengers to be small aircraft and those that can accommodate or more passengers to be large aircraft 
net sales of airframe components for small aircraft increased million to million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal net sales of turbine engine components for small aircraft  which consist primarily of business aircraft and regional commercial jets  as well as military transport and surveillance aircraft  decreased million to million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal net sales of airframe components for large aircraft increased million to million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal net sales of turbine engine components for large aircraft decreased million to million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the decrease in the acm group s net sales volumes during fiscal was offset by an increase in the acm group s selling prices due to increases in raw 
table of contents material prices in the market place  some of which was passed through to the acm group s customers 
other product and non product sales were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the acm group s airframe and turbine engine component products have both military and commercial applications 
net sales of airframe and turbine engine components that solely have military applications were million in both fiscal and selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal this million increase in fiscal was principally due to an increase in administrative and sales salaries resulting from the full year impact of certain positions that were vacant during a portion of fiscal  as well as the absence in fiscal of a reduction in the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable that occurred in fiscal the acm group s operating loss in fiscal was million  compared with operating income of million in fiscal operating results were negatively impacted in fiscal  compared with fiscal  due to the negative impact on margins resulting from lower sales volumes  as well as by i an increase in raw material prices  ii an increase in energy costs  iii an increase in spending on manufacturing supplies and other related expenses  and iv a million increase in the lifo provision due principally to the increased cost of steel alloys

the remaining selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were million  or of net sales 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is principally attributable to i an increase in compensation and employee benefit expenses consisting primarily of severance benefits incurred as a result of a reorganization of personnel that occurred in early fiscal and ii an increase in employee compensation and other employee related expenses required to complete staffing needs as a result of the reorganization of personnel 
the asc group s operating income was million in fiscal compared with a loss of million in fiscal included in the million operating loss in fiscal was a million non cash impairment charge related to the previously discussed write off of goodwill 
corporate unallocated expenses corporate unallocated expenses  consisting of corporate salaries and benefits  legal and professional and other corporate expenses  were million in both fiscal and a million decrease in legal and professional expenses was offset by a million increase in compensation and employee benefit expenses consisting primarily of severance benefits incurred as a result of a reorganization of personnel

during the first quarter of fiscal  the euro strengthened in relation to the us dollar while during the last three quarters of fiscal  the euro weakened in relation to the us dollar 
other income includes i a million gain on the sale of a building and land that was part of the repair group s tampa  florida operation  ii a million gain on the sale of a building and land that was part of the repair group s irish operations  and iii million of gain on the sales of certain excess raw material inventory by the acm group 
both buildings and land that were sold were included in assets held for sale at september  in fiscal and  the income tax benefit related to the company s us and us subsidiary losses was offset by a valuation allowance based upon an assessment of the company s ability to realize such benefits 
in assessing the company s ability to realize its deferred tax assets  management considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
future reversal of the valuation allowance will be achieved either when the tax benefit is realized or when it has been determined that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be realized through future taxable income 
the deferred tax asset of recognized in fiscal is attributable to the gain on the disposal of a building and land in october that was part of the repair group s irish operations  and that was recognized for irish income tax purposes in fiscal but was recognized for financial reporting purposes in fiscal in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company also recorded a us income tax provision in fiscal under the american jobs creation act of for a dividend it received from its non us subsidiaries 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year fiscal net sales increased to million  compared with million in fiscal net loss for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared with a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal turbine component services and repair group repair group the repair group had net sales of million  up from the million in fiscal turbine engine component manufacturing and repair net sales increased million to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal demand for precision component machining and for component repairs for industrial turbine engines and large aerospace turbine engines increased  while the demand for component repairs for small aerospace turbine engines decreased in fiscal  compared with fiscal this reflects an increase in demand for component repairs for newer model large aerospace turbine engines offset by reduced demand for component repairs for older model large aerospace turbine engines 
in addition  net sales associated with the demand for replacement parts  which often complement component repair services provided to customers  increased million in fiscal to million  compared with million in fiscal during fiscal  the repair group s selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales  in fiscal included in the million of selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were charges aggregating million related to the impairment of

the repair group s operating loss in fiscal decreased million to million from a million loss in fiscal included in the million operating loss in fiscal were charges aggregating million related to the impairment of equipment and million of severance charges 
operating results improved in fiscal principally due to the non recurrence of the aforementioned impairment and severance charges 
the increased sales volumes for component manufacturing and repair service would have had a more positive impact on margins if not for the negative impact of the continued strength of the euro against the us dollar as described below 
during fiscal  the euro continued to strengthen in relation to the us dollar 
the repair group s non us operation has most of its sales denominated in us dollars while a significant portion of its operating costs are denominated in euros 
therefore  as the euro strengthens  costs denominated in euros are negatively impacted 
during fiscal  the repair group hedged much of its exposure to the strengthening euro thereby mitigating the negative impact on its operating results in that period 
during fiscal  the company did not hedge all of its exposure to the strengthening euro  and the exposure that it did hedge was done at exchange rates less favorable than fiscal and  therefore  the resulting impact on the repair group s operating results in fiscal was higher operating costs of approximately million related to its non us operations  including selling  general and administrative expenses  when compared to fiscal aerospace component manufacturing group acm group net sales of the acm group in fiscal increased to million  compared with million in fiscal for purposes of the following discussion  the acm group considers aircraft that can accommodate less than passengers to be small aircraft and those that can accommodate or more passengers to be large aircraft

liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents decreased to million at september  from million at september  at present  a majority of the company s cash and cash equivalents are in the possession of its non us subsidiaries and relate to undistributed earnings 
distributions from the company s non us subsidiaries to the company may be subject to statutory restrictions  adverse tax consequences or other limitations 
in october  the american jobs creation act of act was enacted 
the act contains a one time provision allowing earnings of controlled foreign companies to be 
table of contents repatriated  at a reduced tax rate  during the tax year that includes october or during the subsequent tax year 
pursuant to the act  the company received a dividend from its non us subsidiaries during fiscal in the amount of million and the funds were principally used to reduce the company s outstanding indebtedness 
the company s operating activities consumed cash of million in fiscal  compared with million of cash provided in fiscal the increase in cash consumed by operating activities in fiscal is primarily due to an operating loss of million  a million increase in inventories  and a million decrease in other long term liabilities 
the change in these components of working capital was due to factors resulting from normal business conditions of the company  including sales levels and increased inventory levels required to support principally the acm group s customer demand  and pension contributions made in fiscal capital expenditures were million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal fiscal capital expenditures consist of million by the acm group  million by the asc group and million by the repair group 
capital expenditures in fiscal consisted primarily of equipment to expand and diversify the acm group s manufacturing capabilities and the repair group s repair and precision component machining capabilities 
the company anticipates that total fiscal capital expenditures will approximate million 
fiscal capital expenditures are anticipated to i provide increased range of manufacturing capabilities  ii automate certain operations  and iii enhance the company s service and repair capabilities 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company paid off the remaining million outstanding balance of its year industrial development variable rate demand revenue bond using the proceeds from the sale of the repair group s tampa  florida facility that was sold during the first quarter of fiscal and was included in assets held for sale at september  also during the first quarter of fiscal  the company paid off the remaining million outstanding balance of its term note payable to bank using primarily the proceeds of a dividend from the company s non us subsidiaries 
at september   the company has a million revolving credit agreement with a us bank  subject to sufficiency of collateral that expires on october  and bears interest at the us bank s base rate plus 
the interest rate was at september  a commitment fee is incurred on the unused balance of the revolving credit agreement 
at september   there was no outstanding balance and the company had approximately million available under its million us revolving credit agreement 
the company s revolving credit agreement is secured by substantially all of the company s assets located in the us  a guarantee by its us subsidiaries and a pledge of of the company s ownership interest in its non us subsidiaries 
under its credit agreement with the us bank  the company is subject to certain customary covenants 
these include  without limitation  covenants as defined that require maintenance of certain specified financial ratios  including a minimum tangible net worth level and a minimum ebitda level 
during fiscal  the company entered into agreements with its us bank to i waive its financial ratio covenants as of december   march   and june   respectively  ii amend its financial ratio covenants for future periods  and iii extend the maturity date of the revolving credit agreement 
in november  the company entered into an agreement with its us bank to waive and or amend certain provisions of its revolving credit agreement 
the amendment i waives the minimum tangible net worth level and minimum ebitda level at september   ii amends the minimum tangible net worth level and minimum ebitda level for future periods  iii establishes a million reserve against the million total revolving credit agreement amount  thereby reducing the available revolving credit agreement amount to million  and iv extends the maturity of the revolving credit agreement to december  taking into consideration the impact of this agreement  the company was in compliance with all applicable covenants at september  effective september   the company s irish subsidiary  entered into a debt purchase agreement and certain related agreements with an irish bank 
the debt purchase agreement expires on september  and covers eligible accounts receivable of the company s irish subsidiary  as defined 
the maximum amount of this facility is approximately million and the facility s discounting rate is i the irish bank s prime rate plus at september  on euro denominated accounts receivable  ii the irish bank s cost of funds plus at september  on us dollar denominated accounts receivable  and iii the irish bank s cost of funds plus at september  on british sterling denominated accounts receivable 
the entire amount outstanding at september  under the debt purchase agreement is payable in us dollars  and the company had million available under such agreement 
the debt purchase agreement provides for certain customary events of default including  without limitation  failure to pay any sum due to the irish bank  failure to comply with covenants  and the occurrence of a material adverse change in the business condition of the company

the company believes that cash flows from its operations together with existing cash reserves and the funds available under its credit agreements will be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements through the end of fiscal year however  no assurances can be given as to the sufficiency of the company s working capital to support the company s operations 
if the existing cash reserves  cash flow from operations and funds available under the revolving credit agreement are insufficient  if working capital requirements are greater than currently estimated  and or if the company is unable to satisfy the covenants set forth in its credit agreements  the company may be required to adopt one or more alternatives  such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures  restructuring indebtedness  selling assets or operations  or issuing additional shares of capital stock in the company 
there can be no assurance that any of these actions could be accomplished  or if so  on terms favorable to the company  or that they would enable the company to continue to satisfy its working capital requirements

outlook the company s repair and acm groups businesses continue to be heavily dependent upon the strength of the commercial airlines as well as aircraft and related engine manufacturers 
consequently  the performance of the domestic and international air transport industry directly and significantly impacts the performance of the repair and acm groups businesses 
the events of september  resulted in an immediate reduction in the demand for passenger travel both in the us and internationally 
in addition  the financial condition of many airlines in the us and throughout the world continues to be weak 
the us airline industry has received us government assistance  while some airlines have entered bankruptcy proceedings  and others continue to pursue major restructuring initiatives 
in more recent years  declines in the commercial airline  aircraft and related engine industries have been offset by increases in us military spending for aircraft and related components  and the demand for passenger travel has rebounded to pre september  levels 
the air transport industry s long term outlook has been one of continued  steady growth 
such outlook suggests the need for additional aircraft and  therefore  growth in the requirement for airframe and engine components as well as aerospace turbine engine repairs 

table of contents it is difficult to determine the potential long term impact that the aforementioned factors may have on air travel and the demand for the products and services provided by the company 
these factors could result in further credit risk associated with doing business with the financially troubled airlines and their suppliers 
all of these consequences  to the extent that they may occur  could negatively impact the company s net sales  operating profits and cash flows 
however  in light of the current business environment  the company believes that that cash on hand  funds available under its revolving credit agreement  and anticipated funds generated from operations will be adequate to meet its liquidity needs through the foreseeable future

critical accounting policies and estimates allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain customers to make required payments 
the company evaluates the adequacy of its allowances for doubtful accounts each quarter based on the customers credit worthiness  current economic trends or market conditions  past collection history  aging of outstanding accounts receivable and specific identified risks 
inventories the company maintains allowances for obsolete and excess inventory 
the company evaluates its allowances for obsolete and excess inventory each quarter 
each business segment maintains formal policies  which require at a minimum that reserves be established based on an analysis of the age of the inventory on a part by part basis 
in addition  if the company learns of specific obsolescence  other than that identified by the aging criteria  an additional reserve will be recognized as well 
specific obsolescence may arise due to a technological or market change  or based on cancellation of an order 
impairment of long lived assets the company reviews the carrying value of its long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  at least annually or when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
this review is performed using estimates of future undiscounted cash flows  which include proceeds from disposal of assets 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is greater than the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  the long lived asset is considered impaired and an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
the company has a significant amount of property  plant and equipment 
the determination as to whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable involves judgment 
the company believes that its estimate of future undiscounted cash flows is a critical accounting estimate because i it requires the company to make assumptions about future results and ii the impact of recognizing an impairment charge could have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
in projecting future undiscounted cash flows  the company relies on internal budgets and forecasts  and projected proceeds upon disposal of long lived assets 
the company s budgets and forecasts are based on historical results and anticipated future market conditions  such as the general business climate and the effectiveness of competition 
the company believes that its estimates of future undiscounted cash flows and fair value are reasonable  however  changes in estimates of such undiscounted cash flows and fair value could change the company s estimates of fair value 
further  actual results can differ significantly from assumptions used by the company in making its estimates 
future changes in the company s estimates could result in future impairment charges 
goodwill the company complied with the accounting standards that require goodwill to be tested for impairment at least annually using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the segment 
if the fair value of the segment exceeds its book value  goodwill of the segment is not considered impaired 
at september   the company determined that the fair value of the asc group did not exceed its book value  including goodwill 
as a consequence  the company concluded that the asc group s goodwill was fully impaired at september  and  therefore  a full write off as of such date was appropriate 

table of contents valuation of deferred tax allowance the company accounts for deferred taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  whereby the company recognizes an income tax benefit related to its consolidated net losses and other temporary differences between financial reporting basis and tax reporting basis 
at september   the company s net deferred tax asset before any valuation allowance was million 
at september   the income tax benefit related to its consolidated net losses and other temporary differences between financial reporting basis and tax reporting basis was offset by a valuation allowance of million based on an assessment of the company s ability to realize such benefits 
in assessing the company s ability to realize its deferred tax assets  management considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
future reversal of the valuation allowance will be achieved either when the tax benefit is realized or when it has been determined that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be realized through future taxable income

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  the company is subject to foreign currency and interest rate risk 
the risks primarily relate to the sale of the company s products in transactions denominated in non us dollar currencies primarily the euro  the payment in local currency of wages and other costs related to the company s non us operations  and changes in interest rates on the company s long term debt obligations 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
the company believes that inflation has not materially affected its results of operations in  and does not expect inflation to be a significant factor in fiscal a 
foreign currency risk the us dollar is the functional currency for all of the company s us operations as well as its irish subsidiary 
the functional currency of the irish subsidiary is the us dollar because a substantial majority of the subsidiary s transactions 
table of contents are denominated in us dollars 
for these operations  all gains and losses from completed currency transactions are included in income currently 
for the company s other non us subsidiaries  the functional currency is the local currency 
assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at the rate of exchange at the end of the period and revenues and expenses are translated using average rates of exchange 
foreign currency translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated statements of shareholders equity 
historically  the company has been able to mitigate the impact of foreign currency risk by means of hedging such risk through the use of foreign currency exchange contracts  which typically expire within one year 
however  such risk is mitigated only for the periods for which the company has foreign currency exchange contracts in effect  and only to the extent of the us dollar amounts of such contracts 
at september   the company had forward exchange contracts outstanding for durations of up to months to purchase euros aggregating us million at a weighted average euro to us dollar exchange rate of approximately 
a ten percent appreciation or depreciation of the value of the us dollar  relative to the currency in which the forward exchange contracts outstanding at september  are denominated  would result in a million decline or increase  respectively  in the value of the forward exchange contracts 
the company will continue to evaluate its foreign currency risk  if any  and the effectiveness of using similar hedges in the future to mitigate such risk 
at september   the company s assets and liabilities denominated in british pounds and the euro were as follows amounts in thousands british pounds euro cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable accounts payable accrued liabilities b 
interest rate risk the company s primary interest rate risk exposure results from the variable interest rate mechanisms associated with the company s long term debt consisting of a revolving credit agreement with a us bank and a debt purchase agreement with an irish bank 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease basis points from the september  rate  and assuming no change in the amount outstanding under the revolving credit agreement and the debt purchase agreement  annual interest expense to the company would be nominally impacted 
the company s sensitivity analyses of the effects of changes in interest rates do not consider the impact of a potential change in the level of variable rate borrowings or derivative instruments outstanding that could take place if these hypothetical conditions prevail
