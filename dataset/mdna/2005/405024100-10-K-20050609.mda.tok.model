item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our business we design  manufacture and market automated systems for the collection  processing and surgical salvage of donor and patient blood  including the single use disposables used with our systems and related data management software 
our systems allow users to collect and process only the blood component s they target  plasma  platelets  or red blood cells  increasing donor and patient safety as well as collection efficiencies 
our systems consist of proprietary disposable sets that operate on our specialized equipment 
our data management systems are used by blood collectors to improve the safety and efficiency of blood collection logistics by eliminating previously manual functions at commercial plasma and not for profit blood banks 
we either sell our devices to customers equipment revenue or place our devices with customers subject to certain conditions 
when the device remains our property  the customer has the right to use it for a period of time as long as they meet certain conditions we have established  which among other things  generally include one or more of the following o purchase and consumption of a minimum level of disposable products o payment of monthly rental fees o an asset utilization performance metric  such as performing a minimum level of procedures per month per device 
our disposable revenue stream including sales of disposables and fees for the use of our equipment accounted for approximately of our total revenues for fiscal years  and product families our donor products include systems to collect plasma  platelets and red cells from blood donors 
we market our donor products primarily to blood collectors which include both for profit plasma collectors and not for profit blood banks 
our patient products include systems to collect during and after surgery  wash and filter unwanted substances from the blood prior to reinfusion to the surgical patient 
we market these patient products to hospitals and hospital service providers 
miscellaneous and service revenue includes revenue generated from equipment repairs performed under preventive maintenance contracts or emergency service billings  as well as revenue from software sales 
donor products plasma o plasma collection systems these systems are used by plasma collectors to collect the plasma component of a donor s whole blood 
the plasma is sold to fractionators for processing into therapeutic pharmaceuticals and vaccines 
automated plasma collection is a safe and cost effective improvement to manual non automated plasma collection which is time consuming  labor intensive  produces relatively poor yields  and poses risk to donors 
currently the majority of plasma collections worldwide are automated collections 
blood bank o platelet collection systems these systems are used by blood collectors to collect the platelet component of a donor s whole blood 
platelets are transfused to cancer patients whose platelets have been depleted as a result of chemotherapy 
before the advent of our platelet collection technology  the pooling or combination of platelets from six to eight different donors was the only alternative to prepare a single therapeutic dose for transfusion to a patient 
our mcs r line of products allows the collection of a sufficient number of platelets from only one donor to produce one or two therapeutic doses 
o cell processing systems these systems are used to freeze  thaw and wash red cells  which enables blood collectors to better manage their red cell inventories 
in a liquid state  red cells must be transfused within days whereas frozen red cells may be stored for up to ten years 
previous generation freezing technology required that red cells be transfused within hours after thawing  our acp r systems allow red cells to be transfused for up to days post thaw 
o intravenous solutions we contract manufacture sterile intravenous solutions for pharmaceutical customers 
these solutions include generic drugs and other custom drug products 
red cell o red cell collection systems these systems are used to automate the collection of red cells from blood donors with protocols that allow for the collection of two units of red cells  a unit of red cells and a unit of plasma  or a unit of red cells and a unit of platelets 
the systems improve the blood collector s operational efficiency by increasing the volume of blood components collected per donation event and eliminating manual processing 
the most frequently used red cell collection protocol collects twice the number of red cells than the traditional non automated collection method and helps blood systems address red cell shortages that commonly plague health care systems 
patient products surgical o surgical blood salvage systems these systems are used by hospitals to collect a patient s own blood during or after surgery for reinfusion to the patient  mitigating or eliminating the need for transfusion of donated blood 
we market cell saver r brand systems for higher blood loss procedures such as cardiovascular surgeries and the orthopat r brand system for lower blood loss orthopedic surgeries 
the cardiopat brand system is our newest product  targeted at beating heart and other cardiovascular surgeries that result in bleeding during and after surgery

net revenues for fiscal year increased over fiscal year the favorable effects of foreign exchange contributed of the increase with the remaining resulting from disposable increases in our blood bank  red cell  and surgical product lines and price increases  partly offset by decreases in our plasma product line 
during fiscal year  higher sales  the positive effects of foreign exchange  and cost reductions resulted in a gross profit increase of and an operating income increase of over fiscal year net income increased as compared to fiscal year this increase was a reflection of higher operating income partly offset by the increase in our income tax rate to in fiscal year versus in fiscal year due to a million tax refund recorded during fiscal year the comparisons to fiscal year are impacted by the fact that fiscal year included weeks  while fiscal years and each included weeks  resulting from the policy that we use to determine our fiscal year end 
the rd week in fiscal year gave rise to both additional revenues and operating expenses 
market trends plasma market despite the continued increase in demand for plasma derived pharmaceuticals  particularly intravenous immunoglobulin ivig  three significant factors have influenced demand in the worldwide commercial plasma collection markets o the commercial plasma industry experienced significant consolidation among plasma collectors and fractionators 
industry consolidation impacts us when a collector changes the total number of its collection centers  the total number of collections performed per center or changes the plasma collection system haemonetics or competitive technology used to perform some or all of those collections 
o in fiscal year fewer collection procedures were performed worldwide as a result of an oversupply of source plasma 
in the us  our customers have recently observed an increase in the number of collection being performed by some customers 
accordingly  we believe that the inventory of source plasma has largely stabilized in the us in europe  we understand from customers that supply is beginning to come into alignment with demand and so we expect collections should level off in the near future 
in japan  there is a still an oversupply of plasma 
o reimbursement guidelines affect the demand for end product pharmaceuticals 
o the newer plasma fractionation facilities make more efficient use of plasma in their production processes  utilizing less plasma to make similar quantities of pharmaceuticals and vaccines 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we entered into a long term supply agreement with zlb plasma services zlb to be its exclusive provider of plasma collection technology in the us blood bank market despite modest to moderate increases in the demand for platelets in our major markets  improved collection efficiencies that increase the yield of platelets per collection have resulted in a flat market for disposables 
we expect our sales of intravenous solutions that we produce under contract for pharmaceutical companies to level off in the near term 
red cell market blood demands  a need for greater operating efficiency  and a stringent regulatory environment continue to drive demand for our red cell products 
our business continues to grow as we gain new customers and expand our penetration at existing customer sites 
additionally  our sales continue to increase as more customers have migrated to our higher priced filtered disposable sets which support our customers good manufacturing processes by reducing manual processing 
surgical market the part of the us surgical blood salvage market that is aimed at higher blood loss cardiovascular procedures is declining and may continue to decline due to improved surgical techniques minimizing blood loss and a decrease in the number of open heart bypass surgeries performed 
as technology improves  as seen by the continuous improvements made to coronary stents and angioplasty  the preference of surgeons may shift to minimally invasive surgical procedures  further reducing the number of open heart surgeries performed 
the main driver of growth is the lower blood loss orthopedic procedures served by our orthopat system 
we sell the orthopat system through a distributor in the us and direct in our other major markets

reported tax rate the reduction in the reported tax rate in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year resulted from several factors  including o an increase in tax exempt interest income o higher current year us export tax benefits  as well as additional export tax benefits realized in connection with the filing of our fiscal year tax return 
o a reduction in foreign taxes  due to the reversal of previously established tax reserves related to a local japanese tax matter 
the reduction in the reported tax rate in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year resulted from a million tax refund recorded in fiscal year critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are summarized in note of our consolidated financial statements 
while all of these significant accounting policies impact our financial condition and results of operations  we view certain of these policies as critical 
policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and or estimates 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the accounting policies identified as critical are as follows revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap as outlined in staff accounting bulletin sab no 
which requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery  including customer acceptance  has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we believe that our revenue recognition policy is critical because revenue is a very significant component of our results of operations 
we record software sales in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  and in instances where services are essential to the functionality of the software  as is the case in the majority of fifth dimensions software sales  revenue is recognized in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
in accordance sop  when the services are essential to the functionality of the software  or payment of the license fees are dependent upon the performance of the services  the software license  configuration  training and implementation fees are recognized under the contract method of accounting using labor hours to measure the completion percentage 
in order to apply the contract method of accounting  management is required to estimate the number of hours needed to complete a particular project 
as a result  recognized revenues and profits are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
on a quarterly basis  inventory quantities on hand are reviewed and an analysis of the provision for excess and obsolete inventory is performed based primarily on our estimates of product demand and production requirements for the next twenty four months 
a change in the estimated timing or amount of demand for our products could result in additional provisions for excess inventory quantities on hand 
any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and reported operating results 
goodwill and other intangible assets purchase accounting requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair market value of the assets and liabilities purchased  with the excess value  if any  being classified as goodwill 
in addition  as described in notes and of our consolidated financial statements  as a result of our acquisitions  values were assigned to intangible assets for patented and unpatented technologies and customer contracts and related relationships 
for those assets with finite lives  useful lives were assigned to these intangibles and they will be amortized over their remaining life 
we review our intangible assets and their related useful lives at least once a year to determine if any adverse conditions exist that would indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
we conduct more frequent impairment assessments if certain conditions exist  including a change in the competitive landscape  any internal decisions to pursue new or different technology strategies  a loss of a significant customer  or a significant change in the market place including changes in the prices paid for our products or changes in the size of the market for our products 
an impairment results if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and disposition of the asset 
the amount of the impairment would be determined by comparing the carrying value to the fair value of the asset 
fair value is generally determined by calculating the present value of the estimated future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate 
the projection of the future cash flows and the selection of a discount rate require significant management judgment 
the key variables that management must estimate include sales volume  prices  inflation  product costs  capital expenditures and sales and marketing costs 
for developed technology patents and other technology that have not been deployed we also must estimate the likelihood of both pursuing a particular strategy and the level of expected market adoption 
significant judgment is involved in making these estimates 
future write downs may be required if the value of the assets become impaired 
in fiscal year  we recognized an impairment charge of million related to the excess of the carrying value over the fair market value of an intangible asset categorized as other technology 
the impairment was triggered by our re evaluation of our plans to deploy such technology 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are depreciated over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
any change in conditions that would cause us to change our estimate as to the useful lives of a group or class of assets may significantly impact our depreciation expense on a prospective basis 
haemonetics equipment includes devices that we have placed at our customers under contractual arrangements that allow them to use the device in exchange for rental payments or the purchase of disposables 
in addition to periodically reviewing the useful lives of these devices  we also periodically perform reviews to determine if a group of these devices is impaired 
to conduct these reviews we must estimate the future amount and timing of demand for these devices 
changes in expected demand can result in additional depreciation expense  which is classified as cost of goods sold 
any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of equipment and our reported operating results 
income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  income tax expense is calculated for all jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current taxes due plus assessing temporary differences arising from differing treatment for tax and accounting purposes that are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are periodically evaluated to determine their recoverability 
a valuation allowance is established and a corresponding additional income tax expense is recorded in our consolidated statement of income if their recovery is not likely 
the provision for income taxes could also be materially impacted if actual taxes due differ from our earlier estimates 
as of april   a valuation allowance of million existed on our balance sheet 
the total net deferred tax asset as of april  was million 
we file income tax returns in all jurisdictions in which we operate 
we established reserves to provide for additional income taxes that may be due in future years as these previously filed tax returns are audited 
these reserves have been established based on management s assessment as to the potential exposure attributable to permanent differences and interest applicable to both permanent and temporary differences 
all tax reserves are analyzed periodically and adjustments made as events occur that warrant modification

o million more capital expenditures during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year during fiscal year  we had capital expenditures of million 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities increased by million 
the increase was due to o million in increased proceeds from stock option exercises during fiscal year o million due to a fiscal year decrease in short term debt in japan for working capital purposes 
fiscal as compared to fiscal operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased million in due primarily to o a million increase in net income adjusted for non cash items  o a million increase in cash provided from accounts receivable due to the timing of customer payments  particularly in japan  with the rd week in fiscal year  and o million increase in cash provided by reduced investments in inventory 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased million as a result of o million in increased cash spent on short term investments in fiscal year due to the reinvestment in fiscal year of investments liquidated in fiscal year offset by  o million from an increase in proceeds in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year from the sale of property  plant and equipment  o million less cash spent on capital expenditures during fiscal year  and o million more spent in fiscal year for pathogen reduction technology 
during fiscal year  we had capital expenditures of million 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities increased by million 
the change was driven by the following factors o million repurchases of our stock in fiscal year and no repurchases in fiscal year  o million from increased stock option exercises in fiscal year  and o a million decrease in the short term debt primarily in japan for working capital purposes 
contractual obligations and contingencies a summary of our contractual and commercial commitments as of april   is as follows for more information concerning our debt see note to the consolidated financial statements and for our operating lease obligations see note payments due by period contractual obligations less than in thousands total year years years after years debt      operating leases      purchase commitments   total      includes amounts we are committed to spend on purchase orders entered in the normal course of business for capital equipment and for the purpose of manufacturing our products including contract manufacturers  specifically nova biomedical  for the purchase of devices and jms co 
ltd  and kawasumi laboratories for the manufacture of certain disposable products 
the majority of our operating expense spending does not require any advance commitment 
contingent commitments as a result of our fiscal year license arrangement for blood processing technology  our fiscal year acquisition of fifth dimension  and our fiscal year agreement with baxter related to pathogen reduction technology  we are contingently obligated to make certain payments 
the fiscal year license arrangement involves certain potential payments of up to million if the technology reaches certain performance milestones 
in addition  if the specified deliverables are completed  the agreement calls for minimum royalty payments for future commercial sales of products that incorporate this technology 
the fifth dimension acquisition involves certain potential payments of up to million of which million has already been paid 
therefore our current potential obligation is million should sales of the fifth dimension software products exceed certain cumulative levels prior to the end of fiscal year the pathogen reduction agreement calls for us to make total potential payments of up to million as regulatory approvals are received in various markets 
out of the million of potential payments  we paid million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year as initial regulatory approvals were obtained in the european market 
no payments were made in fiscal year or fiscal year if and when additional approvals are obtained  we will capitalize these payments as other technology  an intangible asset and amortize over their useful life 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our results of operations for the periods presented 
historically  we believe we have been able to minimize the effects of inflation by improving our manufacturing and purchasing efficiency  by increasing employee productivity and by adjusting the selling prices of new products we introduce 
foreign exchange approximately of our sales are generated outside the us in local currencies  yet our reporting currency is the us dollar 
our primary foreign currency exposures in relation to the us dollar are the japanese yen and the euro 
foreign exchange risk arises because we engage in business in foreign countries in local currency 
exposure is partially mitigated by producing and sourcing product in local currency and expenses incurred by local sales offices 
however  whenever the us dollar strengthens relative to the other major currencies  there is an adverse affect on our results of operations and alternatively  whenever the us dollar weakens relative to the other major currencies there is a positive effect on our results of operations 
it is our policy to minimize for a period of time  the unforeseen impact on our financial results of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates by using derivative financial instruments known as forward contracts to hedge the anticipated cash flows from forecasted foreign currency denominated sales 
hedging through the use of forward contracts does not eliminate the volatility of foreign exchange rates  but because we generally enter into forward contracts one year out  rates are fixed for a one year period  thereby facilitating financial planning and resource allocation 
we enter into forward contracts that mature one month prior to the anticipated timing of the forecasted foreign currency denominated sales 
these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges intended to lock in the expected cash flows of forecasted foreign currency denominated sales at the available spot rate 
actual spot rate gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in sales  at the same time the underlying transactions being hedged are recorded 
we compute a composite rate index for purposes of measuring  comparatively  the change in foreign currency hedge spot rates from the hedge spot rates of the corresponding period in the prior year 
the relative value of currencies in the index is weighted by sales in those currencies 
the composite was set at based upon the weighted rates at march  the composite rate is presented in the period corresponding to the maturity of the underlying forward contracts 
the favorable or unfavorable changes are in comparison to the same period of the prior year 
a favorable change is presented when we will obtain relatively more us dollars for each of the underlying foreign currencies than we did in the prior period 
an unfavorable change is presented when we obtain relatively fewer us dollars for each of the underlying foreign currencies than we did in the prior period 
these indexed hedge rates impact sales  and as a result also gross profit  operating income and net income  in our consolidated financial statements 
the final impact of currency fluctuations on the results of operations is dependent on the local currency amounts hedged and the actual local currency results composite index favorable unfavorable hedge spot rates change versus prior year fy q q q q total fy q q q q total fy q q q q total fy q q q q total fy q q q q total fy q note represents hedges for april and may fy new accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no

we are currently evaluating which fair value method we will use to adopt the requirements of sfas no 
r 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the fasb recently issued  fasb statement sfas no 
 inventory costs  sfas no 
an amendment of accounting research bulletin arb no 
 chapter the amendment clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials should be recognized as current period charges 
it also clarifies that the required allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
we will adopt sfas no 
on april  at the beginning of our fiscal year the clarification provided by sfas no 
is consistent with our current accounting policy  and accordingly we expect no impact from the adoption of this statement 
in october  the american jobs creation act of ajca was enacted 
the ajca provides a deduction from income for qualified domestic production activities that will be phased in beginning in and fully implemented in the ajca also provides a two year phase out for the existing extra territorial income exclusion on foreign sales 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
 application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities by the american jobs creation act of it is our intent to maximize this deduction and we are currently evaluating the impact this will have on our future consolidated statements of income and financial position 
the ajca also provides a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an dividends received deduction  provided certain criteria are met 
at this time it is not practical to determine if this temporary incentive is appropriate for us or to estimate the amount of tax that would be required to be provided upon repatriation 
accordingly  until our evaluation is complete  we will not change our current intention to permanently reinvest accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 
cautionary statement regarding forward looking information statements contained in this report  as well as oral statements we make which are prefaced with the words may  will  expect  anticipate  continue  estimate  project  intend  designed  and similar expressions  are intended to identify forward looking statements regarding events  conditions  and financial trends that may affect our future plans of operations  business strategy  results of operations  and financial position 
these statements are based on our current expectations and estimates as to prospective events and circumstances about which we can give no firm assurance 
further  any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made  and we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made 
as it is not possible to predict every new factor that may emerge  forward looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of our actual future financial condition or results 
these forward looking statements  like any forward looking statements  involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated 
such risks and uncertainties include technological advances in the medical field and our standards for transfusion medicine and our ability to successfully implement products that incorporate such advances and standards  product demand and market acceptance of our products  regulatory uncertainties  the effect of economic and political conditions  the impact of competitive products and pricing  the impact of industry consolidation  foreign currency exchange rates  changes in customers ordering patterns  the effect of industry consolidation as seen in the plasma market  the effect of communicable diseases and the effect of uncertainties in markets outside the us including europe and asia in which we operate 
the foregoing list should not be construed as exhaustive 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposures relative to market risk are due to foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk 
foreign exchange risk see the section entitled foreign exchange for a discussion of how foreign currency affects our business 
it is our policy to minimize for a period of time  the unforeseen impact on our financial results of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates by using derivative financial instruments known as forward contracts to hedge anticipated cash flows from forecasted foreign currency denominated sales 
we do not use the financial instruments for speculative or trading activities 
at april   we held the following significant foreign exchange contracts to hedge the anticipated cash flows from forecasted foreign currency denominated sales outstanding buy sell weighted spot weighted forward hedged currency local currency contract rate contract rate fair value maturity euro   apr may euro   june aug euro   sep nov euro   dec feb japanese yen  per us per us  apr may japanese yen  per us per us  june aug japanese yen  per us per us  sep nov japanese yen  per us per us  dec feb we estimate the change in the fair value of all forward contracts assuming both a strengthening and weakening of the us dollar relative to all other major currencies 
in the event of a strengthening of the us dollar  the change in fair value of all forward contracts would result in a million increase in the fair value of the forward contracts  whereas a weakening of the us dollar would result in a million decrease in the fair value of the forward contracts 
interest rate risk all of our long term debt is at fixed rates 
accordingly  a change in interest rates has an insignificant effect on our interest expense amounts 
the fair value of our long term debt  however  does change in response to interest rates movements due to its fixed rate nature 
at april   the fair value of our long term debt was approximately million higher than the value of the debt reflected on our financial statements 
this higher fair market is entirely related to our million  fixed rate senior notes and our million  real estate mortgage 
at april   the fair value of our long term debt was approximately million higher than the value of the debt reflected on our financial statements 
this higher fair market is entirely related to our million  fixed rate senior notes and our million  real estate mortgage 
using scenario analysis  if we changed the interest rate on all long term maturities by from the rate levels that existed at april  the fair value of our long term debt would change by approximately million 
concentration of credit risk and significant customers financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents  accounts receivable and investment in sales type lease receivables 
sales to one unaffiliated japanese customer  the japanese red cross society  amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively 
accounts receivable balances attributable to this customer accounted for  and of our consolidated accounts receivable at fiscal year  and  respectively 
while the accounts receivable related to the japanese red cross society may be significant  we do not believe the credit loss risk to be significant given the consistent payment history by this customer 
certain other markets and industries can expose us to concentrations of credit risk 
for example  in our commercial plasma business  we tend to have only a few customers in total but they are large in size 
as a result our accounts receivable extended to any one of these commercial plasma customers can be somewhat significant at any point in time
