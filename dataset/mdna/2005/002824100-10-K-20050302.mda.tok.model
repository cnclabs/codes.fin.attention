item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial review abbott s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short term receivable arrangements 
patent protection and licenses  technological and performance features  and inclusion of abbott s products under a contract or by a pharmacy benefit manager most impact which products are sold  price controls  competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products  and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales 
abbott s primary products are prescription pharmaceuticals  nutritional products and diagnostic testing products 
abbott also owns percent of tap pharmaceutical products inc tap that abbott accounts for on the equity method 
integration activities  regulatory and legal issues  the worldwide launch of humira and the hospira spin off have impacted abbott s sales  costs and financial position over the last three years 
subsequent to abbott s acquisition of the knoll pharmaceutical business  which significantly increased the scale of abbott s pharmaceutical business  abbott focused on reorganizing and growing its global pharmaceutical business 
abbott has established a global research and development organization and a global manufacturing and distribution organization to serve its domestic and international commercial pharmaceutical operations 
pharmaceutical research and development is focused on five therapeutic areas immunology  oncology  neuroscience  diabetes metabolism  and viral diseases 
us commercial pharmaceutical operations are focused on primary care  specialty and hospital pharmaceuticals 
in  abbott began the worldwide launch of humira  which achieved worldwide sales of million in in  abbott separated its diagnostic segment into four separate divisions immunoassay hematology  glucose testing  molecular  and point of care to better focus on commercial and scientific opportunities 
in early  abbott acquired therasense for billion  and began to integrate it with abbott s glucose testing business 
in late  abbott was informed by the fda that it may distribute the immunoassay products in the us that were impacted by regulatory restrictions imposed in net sales and profits for this business declined over the restricted period  but stabilized in in  abbott diagnostics launched more than new products 
in the ross segment in  abbott settled its portion of an industry wide investigation of the enteral nutritional business for million 
in  abbott completed the spin off of hospira  abbott s former hospital products business 
prior to the spin off  the hospital pharmaceutical and vascular device businesses  which abbott retained  were transferred to the pharmaceutical business and abbott vascular products segment  respectively 
annual sales of hospira were approximately billion 
as part of the spin off  hospira assumed million of debt 
the historical operating and cash flow results of hospira are now presented as discontinued operations 
hospira is contractually obligated to purchase the international hospital assets and operations that were not included in the spin off 
tap s contribution to abbott s earnings has declined over the last two years 
a part of the decline is due to increased competition for prevacid  tap s largest selling product  and due to market contraction for prescription proton pump inhibitors 
in  tap recorded additional litigation reserves of million for an anticipated legal settlement 
abbott s short and long term debt totaled billion at december   largely incurred to finance acquisitions 
operating cash flows in excess of capital expenditures and cash dividends have allowed abbott to reduce debt and fund acquisitions over the last three years 
at december   abbott s long term debt rating was aa by standard and poor s and a by moody s investors service 
in  abbott will focus on several key initiatives 
in the pharmaceutical business  abbott expects worldwide sales of humira  its rheumatoid arthritis drug launched in and  to exceed billion in abbott will also focus on appropriate market support for synthroid  which became subject to generic us competition in mid us synthroid sales in and were million and million  respectively  and are projected to exceed million in in  abbott expects a response from the fda to abbott s regulatory submissions made in for xinlay  for prostate cancer  kaletra once daily dosing  zemplar capsules  and additional humira indications  and tap expects a response for its filing for febuxostat 
abbott expects to submit a similar number of additional pharmaceutical regulatory filings in pharmaceutical research and development efforts will continue to be focused in the five therapeutic areas noted above with a significant portion of the development expenditures allocated to new humira indications 
in the immunoassay business  attention will be focused on improving revenue growth by capitalizing on recent product launches  launching additional products  and commercial execution of the existing broad product portfolio 
in addition  abbott expects to place with customers additional architect immunochemistry diagnostic instruments in with a greater focus on consumer marketing  ross will maximize the strength of its core brands and expand its healthy living market presence 
in the other business segments  abbott will focus on developing or acquiring differentiated technologies in higher growth segments of those markets 
critical accounting policies sales rebates approximately percent of abbott s consolidated gross revenues are subject to various forms of rebates and allowances that abbott records as reductions of revenues at the time of sale 
most of these allowances are in two of abbott s domestic segments the pharmaceutical products segment and the ross products segment 
abbott provides rebates to pharmacy benefit management companies  to state agencies which administer the federal medicaid program and the special supplemental food program for women  infants  and children wic  wholesalers  group purchasing organizations  and other government and private entities 
rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product 
factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate  which customer or government price terms apply  and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate 
using historical trends  adjusted for current changes  abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid  and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when abbott records its sale of the product 
settlement of the rebate occurs from two to months after sale 
abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs 
rebates and chargebacks charged against gross sales in amounted to approximately billion  or percent  based on gross sales of approximately billion subject to rebate 
rebates and chargebacks charged against gross sales were approximately billion in and billion in a one percentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales and operating earnings by approximately million 
other allowances charged against gross sales were approximately million  million and million for cash discounts in  and  respectively  and million  million and million for returns in  and  respectively 
cash discounts are known within to days of sale  and therefore can be reliably estimated 
returns can be reliably estimated because abbott s historical returns are low  and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods 
management analyzes the adequacy of ending accrual balances each quarter 
in the ross nutritional business  management uses both internal and external data available to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel 
management internally estimates the inventory in the retail channel that is not on the retail shelf 
a third party continuously measures time on the retail shelf  which is a relatively significant portion of the time inventory is in the distribution channel 
except for a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the wic business in a state  inventory in the distribution channel does not vary substantially 
management also estimates the states processing lag time based on claims data 
in addition  internal processing time is a factor in estimating the accrual 
in the wic business the state where the sale is made  which is the determining factor for the applicable price  is reliably estimable 
estimates are required for the amount of wic sales within each state where abbott has the wic business 
external data sources utilized for that estimate are participant data from the us department of agriculture usda  which administers the wic program  participant data from some of the states  and internally administered market surveys 
the usda has been making its data available for many years 
internal data includes historical redemption rates and pricing data 
at december   ross had the exclusive wic business in states 
recent competitive and market conditions have resulted in a trend towards more wic sales  and therefore a higher sales rebate provision 
in the domestic pharmaceutical business  the most significant charges against gross sales are for medicaid rebates  pharmacy benefit manager rebates and wholesaler chargebacks 
in order to evaluate the adequacy of the ending accrual balances  management uses both internal and external estimates of the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time 
external data sources used to estimate the inventory in the distribution channel include inventory levels periodically reported by wholesalers and third party market data purchased by abbott 
management estimates the processing lag time based on periodic sampling of claims data 
to estimate the price rebate percentage  systems and calculations are used to track sales by product by customer and to estimate the contractual or statutory price 
abbott s systems and calculations have developed over time as rebates have become more significant  and abbott believes they are very reliable 
settlement of rebate accruals from the date of sale ranges from to weeks for wic  to weeks for medicaid  to weeks for pharmacy benefit managers and to weeks for wholesaler chargebacks 
average settlement times are weeks for wic  weeks for medicaid  weeks for pharmacy benefit managers and weeks for wholesaler chargebacks 
the following table is an analysis of the four largest rebate accruals  which comprise approximately percent of the consolidated rebate provisions charged against revenues in information necessary to prepare this table for and is not available due to the spin off of hospira that occurred in remaining rebate provisions charged against gross sales are not significant in the determination of operating earnings 
dollars in thousands pharmaceutical products ross products wic rebates medicaid rebates pharmacy benefit manager rebates wholesaler chargebacks balance at january      provisions     payments     balance at december      in the analysis above  due to systems limitations  it is not practical and has not been necessary to break out current versus prior year activity 
when applicable  abbott analyzes current year activity to identify whether material changes in estimate in the current period relate to prior period sales 
changes in estimates for current and prior years rebate and chargeback accruals have not been material to operating income 
abbott employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it  and where possible  works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts 
for medicaid and other government agency programs  the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations  which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation 
income taxes abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments 
because abbott operates globally  the nature of the audit items are often very complex  and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country 
abbott employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible 
as part of abbott s calculation of the provision for taxes on earnings  abbott records the amount that it expects to incur as a result of audits 
each quarter  abbott reviews its exposures in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
in the us  abbott s federal income tax returns for years to are in the process of being settled at amounts that approximate recorded reserves  years to are settled  and the income tax returns for years after are open 
as discussed in further detail in legislative issues  in february  as a result of the american jobs creation act of  management concluded that it would remit a portion of its foreign earnings previously considered reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries 
except for dividends that will be remitted under the act  abbott does not record deferred income taxes on earnings reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries 
pension and post employment benefits abbott offers pension benefits and post employment health care to many of its employees 
abbott engages outside actuaries to calculate its obligations and costs under these programs 
with the assistance of outside actuaries  abbott must develop long term assumptions  the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rate  discount rate and the expected return on plan assets 
a difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates  which will not be known for decades  can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs 
recent low interest rates have significantly increased unrecognized actuarial losses for these plans 
at december   the unrecognized actuarial losses for abbott s defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans were billion and million  respectively 
unrecognized actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service periods of the employees under the corridor method  in accordance with the rules for accounting for post employment benefits 
differences between the expected long term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a five year period 
footnote to the consolidated financial statements describes the impact of a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate  however  there can be no certainty that a change would be limited to only one percentage point 
in  and  abbott recorded minimum pension liability adjustments of million  million and million  respectively  because the accumulated benefit obligations for certain defined benefit plans exceeded the market value of the plans assets 
this resulted in charges to accumulated other comprehensive income loss of million  million and million  net of taxes  in  and  respectively 
the weighted average discount rate used at december  for determining the accumulated benefit obligations for defined benefit plans whose accumulated benefit obligations were in excess of plan assets was percent 
a one percentage point reduction in the discount rate at december  would result in an increase in the minimum pension liability adjustments and an increase in the charge to accumulated other comprehensive income loss of approximately million and million  respectively 
valuation of intangible assets abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that abbott values and records 
those assets which do not yet have regulatory approval and for which there are no alternative uses are expensed as acquired in process research and development  and those that have regulatory approval are capitalized 
transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field  and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
abbott uses a discounted cash flow model to value acquired intangible assets 
the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash inflows  risk  the cost of capital  and terminal values 
each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset 
abbott engages independent valuation experts who review abbott s critical assumptions and calculations for significant acquisitions of intangibles 
abbott reviews intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach 
if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset  the intangible asset is written down to its fair value  which is usually the discounted cash flow amount 
where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset  the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment of goodwill occurs 
at december   goodwill and intangibles amounted to billion and billion  respectively 
amortization expense for intangible assets amounted to approximately million in there were no impairments of goodwill in litigation abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
under sfas no 
 loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management s best estimate of a loss  or when a best estimate cannot be made  a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded 
these estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known  and the estimates are refined each accounting period  as additional information becomes known 
accordingly  abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss  and therefore the minimum amount  which could be zero  is recorded 
as information becomes known  either the minimum loss amount is increased  resulting in additional loss provisions  or a best estimate can be made  also resulting in additional loss provisions 
occasionally  a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected 
for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures  abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately million to million 
abbott has recorded reserves at december  of approximately million for these proceedings and exposures 
these reserves represent management s best estimate of probable loss  except for one which is recorded at the minimum  as defined by sfas no 
stock compensation abbott currently measures compensation cost using the intrinsic value based method of accounting for stock options and replacement stock options granted to employees and discloses the impact of the fair value method in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued a revised statement of financial accounting standards no 
 share based payment  which requires that fair value be recorded in the results of operations beginning no later than july  since there is no market for trading employee stock options  there is no certainty that the result of the fair value method would be the value at which employee stock options would be traded for cash 
fair value methods require several assumptions  the most significant of which are stock price volatility and the average life of an option

sales in the pharmaceutical products segment of mobic  tricor and flomax in and favorably impacted primary care products sales  and increased sales of humira favorably impacted specialty products sales in and increased sales of humira also favorably impacted other pharmaceuticals sales in the international segment in worldwide sales of humira totaled million in and million in and are forecasted to be more than billion in diagnostic products and international segment products sales were favorably impacted in and by the effect of the relatively weaker us dollar 
diabetes care product sales for the diagnostic products segment were favorably impacted by the acquisition of therasense in the second quarter of in addition  adult nutritionals product sales for the ross products segment were favorably impacted by the acquisitions of zoneperfect in the third quarter of and eas in the fourth quarter of in abbott s annual report on form k for the year ended december   abbott disclosed that the fda was studying conditions under which competitors could rely on abbott s nda to market a competitive product to synthroid 
in the second quarter  the fda granted approval for generic competition to synthroid and generic competitors have entered the market 
us sales of synthroid in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
in late  clarithromycin became subject to generic competition in the united kingdom and germany 
in may of the composition of matter patent on clarithromycin in the us expires 
in the us  abbott markets clarithromycin in two forms  the immediate release and the extended release forms  both of which are covered by additional non composition of matter patents 
there may be further generic competition for clarithromycin in the us and other countries in depending on the results of legal proceedings related to the patents 
us sales of clarithromycin in were million  and international sales were million 
sevoflurane has been subject to generic competition in isolated markets outside of the us and further generic competition in international markets is possible 
international sales of sevoflurane were million in abbott has periodically sold product rights to non strategic products and has recorded the related gains in net sales in accordance with abbott s revenue recognition policies as discussed in footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
related net sales were million in  million in and million in the expiration of licenses or patent protection can affect the future revenues and operating income of abbott 
significant patent expirations and activities in the next three years are as follows 
the pharmaceutical products segment markets tricor in the us under a license agreement and patents covering tricor are being challenged by competitors 
abbott is vigorously defending the patents 
us sales of tricor were million in in abbott received approval for a form of tricor that has additional therapeutic benefits 
this form is covered under non composition of matter patents which expire in the pharmaceutical products segment has an agreement with boehringer ingelheim to co promote and distribute three of its products 
the co promotion rights for all three products phase out over time  beginning in and ending in  and distribution rights expire predominately in and partially in margins are disproportionately lower for these products than for the other products in this segment 
related revenues recorded in were billion  an increase of percent over operating earnings gross profit margins were percent of net sales in  percent in and percent in the gross profit margin in was impacted by the favorable mix effect of exchange on the gross profit margin and by unfavorable product mix  primarily increased sales of lower margin boehringer ingelheim products  as discussed above  in the pharmaceutical products segment 
the gross profit margin for was impacted by a charge of million for an impairment of assets and other expenses as a result of a lower sales forecast for abbokinase  partially offset by favorable product mix  resulting mainly from increased sales in the pharmaceutical products segment 
the gross profit margin for included the effects of the lake county diagnostic fda consent decree charge  restructuring charges and unfavorable product mix  partially offset by the absence of goodwill amortization in gross profit margins in all years were also affected by productivity improvements  higher project expenses for new products  higher manufacturing capacity costs for anticipated unit growth  and the effects of inflation and competitive pricing pressures 
in the us  states receive price rebates from manufacturers of infant formula under the federally subsidized special supplemental food program for women  infants  and children 
there are also rebate programs for pharmaceutical products 
these rebate programs continue to have a negative effect on the gross profit margins of the ross and pharmaceutical products segments 
in addition  pricing pressures unfavorably impacted the gross profit margins for the ross products segment in  and the gross profit margins for the pharmaceutical products segment were unfavorably impacted in and by unfavorable product mix and favorably impacted in by favorable product mix 
in addition  the gross profit margins in and for the pharmaceutical products segment were unfavorably impacted by increased sales of lower margin boehringer ingelheim products and higher other manufacturing costs 
the gross profit margins in and for the diagnostic products segment were impacted by the effects of the fda consent decree  as discussed below 
under terms of a consent decree with the us government  abbott was prohibited from manufacturing certain diagnostic products for sale in the us until its lake county  ill 
manufacturing facilities were found to be in substantial conformity with the food and drug administration s fda quality system regulation 
in december of  the fda found the facilities to be in substantial conformity and abbott began the process of manufacturing impacted products for sale in the us in connection with the consent decree  abbott recorded remediation costs and payments to the government  including a pretax charge of million in research and development expense  excluding acquired in process research and development  was billion in  billion in and billion in and represented percent of net sales in compared to percent of net sales in and percent of net sales in research and development increased in and  but not at the same rate as sales due  in part  to lower spending on phase iii clinical trials in and compared to the majority of research and development expenditures are concentrated on pharmaceutical products 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased percent in compared to increases of percent in and percent in in  abbott recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses  a pretax charge of million related to the settlement of the ross enteral nutritional investigation 
this charge reduced the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses by percentage points for and increased selling  general and administration expenses by percentage points over the increases in selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding the charge for the investigation  were due primarily to increased selling and marketing support for new and existing products  including spending for the launch of humira  as well as spending on other marketed pharmaceutical products 
increases in all three years also reflect inflation  the effect of acquisitions and additional selling and marketing support primarily in the pharmaceutical products and international segments 
in  abbott reflected the requirements of financial accounting standards board staff position no 
 accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the effect of this change reduced the post employment medical and dental plan net cost for by approximately million 
income from tap pharmaceutical products inc joint venture abbott s income from the tap pharmaceutical products inc tap joint venture was lower in and due to decreased sales due to market contraction for prescription proton pump inhibitors  and in by approximately million as a result of an agreement with plaintiffs to settle litigation 
other income expense  net other income expense  net for includes a charge of million as a result of other than temporary declines in the market values of certain equity securities 
net interest expense net interest expense increased in due to a higher level of debt  partially offset by higher interest income 
net interest expense decreased in and due to a lower level of borrowings and lower interest rates 
taxes on earnings the effective income tax rates on income from continuing operations were percent in  percent in and percent in the effective tax rate for reflects adjustments of prior years tax requirements primarily as a result of resolutions of prior years tax audits 
the effective tax rate also reflects the effect of non deductible acquired in process research and development 
the effect of these items for was to decrease the effective tax rate by approximately percentage points 
the effective tax rate for includes the effect of the charge for the settlement of the ross enteral nutritional investigation and the charges for acquired in process research and development 
the effect of these charges for was to increase the effective tax rate by approximately percentage points 
abbott expects to apply an annual effective rate of around percent in  excluding the effects of adoption of the new stock compensation rules and for dividends that will be remitted under the american jobs creation act of  both as discussed below 
spin off of abbott s core hospital products business on april   abbott s board of directors declared a special dividend distribution of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of hospira  inc for every abbott common shares held at the close of business on april   abbott shareholders received one share of hospira common stock on april  all of the shares of hospira s common stock were distributed to abbott shareholders on a pro rata basis 
abbott has received a ruling from the internal revenue service that the spin off qualifies as a tax free distribution to abbott and its us shareholders for us federal income tax purposes 
cash  which is generally taxable to the recipient  was paid in lieu of fractional shares 
hospira included the operations relating to the manufacture and sale of hospital products including specialty injectable pharmaceuticals  medication delivery systems and critical care devices and injectable pharmaceutical contract manufacturing 
hospira included abbott s hospital products segment  after that segment s reorganization on january   and portions of abbott s international segment 
the income and cash flows of hospira and the direct transaction costs of the spin off have been presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of earnings and statement of cash flows 
prior years balance sheets have not been adjusted to reflect the effect of the spin off 
the legal transfer of certain operations and assets net of liabilities outside the united states is expected to occur in and approximately half of these operations are expected to be transferred to hospira in with the remaining operations transferring in the first half of these operations and assets are used in the conduct of hospira s international business and hospira is subject to the risks and entitled to the benefits generated by these operations and assets 
these assets and liabilities have been presented as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  the assets and liabilities held for sale consist primarily of inventories  trade accounts receivable  equipment and trade accounts payable  salaries and other accruals 
in april  abbott borrowed and hospira assumed million of debt  the proceeds of which were retained by abbott to reduce short term borrowings 
hospira is solely responsible for repayment of the principal and for payment of interest on this debt 
abbott has retained liabilities for taxes on income prior to the spin off  post employment medical and dental benefits for most of hospira s us retired employees and us retirement eligible employees  certain potential liabilities  if any  related to alleged improper pricing practices in connection with federal  state and private reimbursement for certain drugs  and the defined benefit retirement plan liabilities and plan assets for most of hospira s retired employees 
in connection with the spin off  abbott s defined benefit  medical and dental and employee stock option programs have been adjusted 
business combinations and technology acquisitions in  abbott paid approximately billion for strategic business and technology acquisitions  as follows 
in the fourth quarter  abbott acquired eas  a nutritional company with a portfolio of nationally recognized brands  for approximately million in cash and spine next  a manufacturer of orthopedic spinal implant devices  for approximately million in cash plus additional milestone payments of up to million upon achievement of future targets 
these fourth quarter acquisitions resulted in a charge of million for acquired in process research and development  intangible assets of approximately million  non tax deductible goodwill of approximately million and deferred income taxes of approximately million 
acquired intangible assets  primarily trade names  are amortized over to years average of approximately years 
in the second quarter  abbott acquired therasense  inc  a leader in the development  manufacturing and marketing of blood glucose self monitoring systems  for approximately billion in cash 
in the second quarter  abbott also acquired certain other product technologies for approximately million 
these second quarter acquisitions resulted in a charge of million for acquired in process research and development  intangible assets of approximately million  non tax deductible goodwill of approximately million and deferred income taxes of approximately million 
acquired intangible assets  primarily product technology  are amortized over to years average of approximately years 
in the first quarter  abbott acquired i stat corporation  a manufacturer of point of care diagnostic products for blood analysis  for approximately million in cash 
this acquisition resulted in a charge of approximately million for acquired in process research and development  intangible assets of approximately million  non tax deductible goodwill of approximately million and deferred income taxes of approximately million 
acquired intangible assets  primarily product technology  are amortized over to years average of approximately years 
in  abbott paid approximately million for strategic business and technology acquisitions  as follows 
abbott acquired zoneperfect nutrition company  a marketer of healthy and nutritious products for active people  for approximately million in cash  integrated vascular systems  inc  a developer of a novel vessel closure technology  for approximately million in cash  and spinal concepts inc  a marketer of spinal fixation products used in the treatment of spinal disorders  diseases and injuries  for approximately million in cash plus additional milestone payments of up to million if agreed upon targets are met 
abbott also acquired the assets of jomed nv s coronary and peripheral interventional business for approximately million in cash 
these acquisitions resulted in a charge of approximately million for acquired in process research and development  intangible assets of approximately million and non tax deductible goodwill of approximately million 
acquired intangible assets  primarily product technology  are amortized over to years average of approximately years 
in  abbott acquired the cardiovascular stent business of biocompatibles international plc and certain cardiovascular stent technology rights from medtronic  inc in addition  abbott acquired an additional percent of the issued common shares of hokuriku seiyaku co  ltd  resulting in abbott owning substantially all of the common shares of hokuriku seiyaku co  ltd 
the aggregate cash purchase price million of these acquisitions resulted in a charge for acquired in process research and development of approximately million  intangible assets of approximately million and non tax deductible goodwill of approximately million 
acquired intangible assets  primarily product technology  are amortized over to years average of approximately years 
had the above acquisitions taken place on january of the previous year  consolidated sales and income would not have been significantly different from reported amounts 
financial condition cash flow net cash from operating activities of continuing operations amounted to billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
net cash from operating activities in was lower than due  in part  to the payment of the ross enteral nutritional settlement  as discussed above 
in  and  million  million and million  respectively  was contributed to the main domestic defined benefit plan 
in addition  abbott transferred approximately million to hospira in in accordance with the employee benefit agreement governing the assumption by hospira of certain defined benefit plan assets and liabilities 
in january  approximately million was contributed to the main domestic defined benefit plan and million was contributed to the post employment medical and dental benefit plans 
abbott expects pension funding for its main domestic pension plan in to to be between million and million annually 
the increased contribution in is due  in part  to anticipation of investment of cash to be remitted under the american jobs creation act of debt and capital at december   abbott s long term debt rating was aa by standard and poor s and a by moody s investors service 
abbott has readily available financial resources  including unused lines of credit of billion  which support domestic commercial paper borrowing arrangements 
in june  the board of directors authorized the purchase of million shares of abbott s common stock and abbott purchased million shares from this authorization from through in  abbott purchased the remaining million of its common shares under this authorization at a cost of approximately million 
in october  the board of directors authorized the purchase of million shares of abbott s common stock from time to time 
no purchases under this authorization were made in under a registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission in september  abbott issued billion of long term debt in that matures in through with interest rates ranging from percent to percent 
proceeds from this debt were used to fund the acquisition of therasense and to pay down domestic commercial paper borrowings 
in connection with these borrowings  abbott entered into interest rate hedge contracts totaling billion to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of the billion of debt 
these contracts are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fixed rate debt due to changes in the long term benchmark interest rates 
the effect of the hedge is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate 
abbott retained million of proceeds from borrowings that hospira assumed as a result of the spin off and used these proceeds to reduce domestic commercial paper borrowings 
in addition  abbott retired long term debt of billion in with proceeds from domestic commercial paper borrowings 
working capital at december   and  working capital was billion  billion and billion  respectively 
capital expenditures capital expenditures of billion in and billion in and were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing  research and development  investments in information technology and administrative support facilities in all segments  and for laboratory instruments placed with customers 
an increased proportion of the capital expenditures will be dedicated to domestic and international pharmaceutical operations 
contractual obligations abbott has periodically entered into agreements in the ordinary course of business  such as assignment of product rights  with other companies which has resulted in abbott becoming secondarily liable for obligations that abbott was previously primarily liable 
since abbott no longer maintains a business relationship with the other parties  abbott is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under these obligations 
based upon past experience  the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote 
in addition  abbott periodically acquires small companies in which abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds 
the following table summarizes abbott s estimated contractual obligations as of december  payment due by period total and thereafter dollars in millions long term debt  including current maturities and future interest payments operating lease obligations capitalized auto lease obligations purchase commitments a   other long term liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheet benefit plan obligations  including minimum pension liability adjustments of   other total      a purchase commitments are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital expenditure requirements 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revised statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 share based payment 
the revised sfas no 
requires that the fair value of stock options be recorded in the results of operations beginning no later than july  stock compensation expense under the prior rules would have reduced reported diluted earnings per share by cents in upon adoption of the revised standard  prior awards are charged to expense under the prior rules  and awards after adoption are charged to expense under the revised rules 
abbott has not determined the effect of the new standard on its earnings  however  expense under the new standard could be somewhat higher 
the effect of adopting the new rules on reported diluted earnings per share is dependent on the number of options granted in the future  the terms of those awards and their fair values  and therefore  the effect on diluted earnings per share could change 
abbott expects to adopt the revised rules on july   but has not determined whether it would adopt prospectively  or retrospectively to january  see footnote to the consolidated financial statements for assumptions used by management in calculating the fair value of employee stock options
