if the company chooses not to purchase the interest  the company must agree to a sale of the project to an unrelated third party at such value 
the company s partner must exercise this right as to all projects subject to the agreement within five years after the receipt of the final certificate of occupancy on the last developed property 
in connection with this development partner  the company has an obligation to provide up to million in credit enhancements to guarantee a portion of the third party construction financing

d promissory note due on one property  repaid in january critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended december  the company has identified six significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies 
these critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates 
with respect to these critical accounting policies  management believes that the application of judgments and assessments is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented 
the six critical accounting policies are impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill the company periodically evaluates its long lived assets  including its investments in real estate and goodwill  for indicators of permanent impairment 
the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance  market conditions  expected holding period of each asset and legal and environmental concerns 
future events could occur which would cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted 
depreciation of investment in real estate the company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a year estimated useful life  building improvements over a year to year estimated useful life and both the furniture  fixtures and equipment and replacements components over a year estimated useful life  all of which are judgmental determinations 
cost capitalization see the capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate section for discussion of the policy with respect to capitalization vs 
expensing of fixed asset repair and maintenance costs 
in addition  the company capitalizes the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on the supervision of major capital and or renovation projects 
these costs are reflected on the balance sheet as an increase to depreciable property 
the company follows the guidance in sfas no 
 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects  for all development projects and uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred 
the company capitalizes  through the date the certificates of occupancy co are issued co s are deemed final within days of issuance  interest  real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on development activities 
these costs are reflected on the balance sheet as construction in progress for each specific property 
the company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of on site employees working directly at our properties  except as noted above on our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy issuance and on specific major rennovation at selected properties when additional incremental employees are hired 
fair value of financial instruments  including derivative instruments the valuation of financial instruments under sfas no 
and sfas no 
and its amendments sfas nos 
requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments 
the company  where possible  bases the fair values of its financial instruments  including its derivative instruments  on listed market prices and third party quotes 
where these are not available  the company bases its estimates on other factors relevant to the financial instruments 
revenue recognition rental income attributable to leases is recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as it is earned  which is not materially different than on a straight line basis 
leases entered into between a resident and a property for the rental of an apartment unit are generally year to year  renewable upon consent of both parties on an annual or monthly basis 
fee and asset management revenue and interest income are recorded on an accrual basis 
stock based compensation prior to  the company had chosen to account for its stock based compensation in accordance with apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  which resulted in no compensation expense for options issued with an exercise price equal to or exceeding the market value of the company s common shares on the date of grant intrinsic method 
the company elected to account for its stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
and its amendment sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  effective in the first quarter of  which resulted in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value of the stock compensation granted 
sfas no 
provides three transition methods for entities that adopt the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
the company elected the prospective method which requires expensing of employee awards granted or modified after january  compensation expense under all of the company s plans is generally recognized over periods ranging from three months to five years 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion and comparative information regarding application of the fair value method to all outstanding employee awards

adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
the april white paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from ffo for previously depreciated operating properties only 
once the company commences the conversion of units to condominiums  it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property 
the company believes that ffo is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company  because it is a recognized measure of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates  ffo can help compare the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies 
ffo in and of itself does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap 
therefore  ffo should not be exclusively considered as an alternative to net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by gaap or as a measure of liquidity 
the company s calculation of ffo may differ from other real estate companies due to  among other items  variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other real estate companies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in short term libor interest rates 
the company does not have any direct foreign exchange or other significant market risk 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the unsecured line of credit 
the company typically incurs fixed rate debt obligations to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures  while it typically incurs floating rate debt obligations to finance working capital needs and as a temporary measure in advance of securing long term fixed rate financing 
the company continuously evaluates its level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors  including its assessment of the current and future economic environment 
the company also utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to limit market risk 
interest rate protection agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or vice versa 
derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation 
the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes

if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by basis points a increase from the company s existing weighted average interest rates  the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by basis points a decrease from the company s existing weighted average interest rates  the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
at december   the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately billion  net of the effects of any derivative instruments 
if market rates of interest permanently increased by basis points a increase from the company s existing weighted average interest rates  the estimated fair value of the company s fixed rate debt would be approximately billion 
if market rates of interest permanently decreased by basis points a decrease from the company s existing weighted average interest rates  the estimated fair value of the company s fixed rate debt would be approximately billion 
at december   the company s derivative instruments had a net liability fair value of approximately million 
if market rates of interest permanently increased by basis points a increase from the company s existing weighted average interest rates  the net liability fair value of the company s derivative instruments would be approximately million 
if market rates of interest permanently decreased by basis points a decrease from the company s existing weighted average interest rates  the net liability fair value of the company s derivative instruments would be approximately million 
these amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company s financial instruments 
the foregoing assumptions apply to the entire amount of the company s debt and derivative instruments and do not differentiate among maturities 
these analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of changes of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the changes 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure or results 
the company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its debt and derivative instruments and  therefore  its exposure to market risk  nor can there be any assurance that long term debt will be available at advantageous pricing 
consequently  future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above
