item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the heading risk factors 
part i item business overview american dental partners  inc adpi is a leading provider of business services to multi disciplinary dental group practices in selected markets throughout the united states 
we are committed to the growth and success of our affiliated dental group practices  and we make substantial investments to support each affiliated dental group s growth 
we assist our affiliates with organizational planning and development  recruiting  retention and training programs  quality assurance initiatives  facilities development and management  employee benefits administration  procurement  information systems  marketing and payor relations  and financial planning  reporting and analysis 
at december   we were affiliated with dental group practices  comprising dentists practicing in locations in states 
dental care industry the market for dental care is large  growing and highly fragmented 
based on centers for medicare medicaid services statistics  estimated expenditures for dental care grew annually from to reaching billion in  and are expected to be approximately billion by  representing a per annum growth rate from to we believe that the growth in expenditures for dental care will continue to be driven by both increases in costs and increases in demand for services due to increased enrollment in dental benefits plans  particularly preferred provider organization ppo plans  and to a lesser extent  network referral plans  increased demand for dental care as a result of the aging population and a greater percentage of the population retaining its dentition  and increased demand for aesthetic dental procedures as a result of an increasing awareness of personal appearance and the development of new dental materials and procedures which address these wants 
we believe that this growth will benefit not only dentists  but companies that provide services to the dental care industry  including dental management service organizations 
however  the failure of any of these factors to materialize could offset increases in demand for dental care  and any such increases may not correlate with growth in our business 
unlike many other sectors of the health care services industry  the dental care profession remains dominated by practices owned and operated by just one dentist 
according to the american dental association ada  in  approximately of the  dentists in the united states were solo practitioners 
the percentage of 
table of contents graduating dentists who initially began their career as an owner of a dental practice fell from in to in according to the ada 
we believe a greater percentage of dentists will practice as partners or associates in group dental practices rather than practicing as a solo practitioner as a result of high educational debt levels and a change in gender profile of graduating dentists 
according to the ada  dental students in graduated with an average of  of debt and were female 
group dental practice provides economic and professional flexibility advantages to graduating dentists as compared to solo practice 
most dental care performed in the united states is categorized as general dentistry 
according to the ada  in  approximately of dentists were general dentists 
general dentistry includes preventative care  diagnosis and treatment planning  as well as procedures such as fillings  crowns  bridges  dentures and extractions 
specialty dentistry  which includes orthodontics  periodontics  endodontics  prosthodontics and pediatric dentistry  represented the remaining of practicing dentists 
historically  dental care was not covered by insurers and consequently was paid for by patients on a fee for service basis 
an increasing number of employers have responded to the desire of employees for enhanced benefits by providing coverage from third party payors for dental care 
these third party payors offer indemnity insurance plans  ppo plans  capitated managed care plans and dental referral plans 
under an indemnity insurance plan  the dental provider charges a fee for each service provided to the insured patient  which is typically the same as that charged to a patient not covered by any type of dental insurance 
we categorize indemnity insurance plans as fee for service plans 
under a ppo plan  the dentist charges a discounted fee for each service provided based on a schedule negotiated with the dental benefit provider 
under a capitated managed care plan  the dentist receives a fixed monthly fee from the managed care organization for each member covered under the plan who selects that dentist as his or her provider 
capitated managed care plans also typically require a co payment by the patient 
dental referral plans are not insurance products but are network based products that provide access to dental care 
typically  a small monthly fee is paid by an individual or employer for a list of dentists who have agreed to accept certain negotiated fees or a discount from their normal fees 
under network referral plans  full reimbursement for dental care provided is made directly by a patient to the participating dentist  as compared to indemnity  ppo and capitation plans in which some level of reimbursement is provided by the payor to the participating dentist 
the national association of dental plans nadp and the delta dental plans association ddpa estimated that million people  or of the population of the united states  were covered by some form of dental benefit plan in this compares with million people  or of the population  in of the million people with coverage  were covered by ppo plans  by indemnity insurance plans  by capitated managed care plans and by dental referral plans 
the nadp and ddpa estimate that nearly million people will be enrolled in a dental benefit plan in representing a per annum growth rate from to the nadp and ddpa estimate the number of people covered by ppo plans increased from million in to million in and will increase to million people in  representing a per annum growth rate from to business objective and strategy our objective is to be the leading business partner to dental group practices in selected markets throughout the united states 
in order to achieve our objective  our strategy is to provide value added resources and support to each of our affiliated dental group practices in order that they may become the market leading  high quality dental group of each of their respective communities 
we believe the core attributes of such a leading dental group include the following i a common identity and clinical philosophy  ii professional recruiting and mentoring programs  iii formalized peer review and quality assurance initiatives  iv functional and well maintained dental facilities  v advanced information systems  and vi a qualified local management team with well defined responsibilities and accountability 
in executing our strategy  we assist our affiliated dental group practices with organizational planning and development  recruiting  retention and training programs  quality assurance initiatives  facilities development and 
table of contents management  employee benefits administration  procurement  information systems  marketing and payor relations  and financial planning  reporting and analysis 
in order to execute our strategy successfully  we are continually enhancing or expanding our capabilities and resources  including vertical integration of ancillary dental activities 
as an example  we expanded our procurement capabilities in with the acquisition and integration of two dental labs  and in we plan to introduce a private label patient financing program developed in conjunction with a leading consumer financial institution 
we believe that successful execution of our strategy will result in growth from the following areas i assisting our current affiliated dental group practices to increase their community presence  ii completing additional affiliations with dental group practices in new communities and iii adding additional capabilities or resources to our service offering through the acquisition of related businesses 
our objective is to help our affiliated dental group practices grow their patient revenue to per annum  and to supplement our growth through completion of additional affiliations in new markets 
we are constantly evaluating potential affiliations with dental group practices and potential acquisitions of companies that would expand our business capabilities 
although we have completed many affiliations and acquisitions since november  there can be no assurance that additional affiliation or acquisition candidates can be identified or that they can be consummated or successfully integrated into our operations 
the number of new affiliations and acquisitions over the next twelve months could be at levels greater or less than we have achieved in recent years 
affiliation philosophy we believe that dental care is an important part of an individual s overall health care 
because the practitioner is best qualified to manage the clinical aspects of dentistry  the provision of dental care must be centered around the dentist 
however  current market trends in health care are increasing the complexity of operating a dental group 
in addition  the principals of many dental group practices are reaching retirement age and are beginning to investigate means for transitioning the non clinical leadership and management of their dental group practices 
consequently  many dental group practices are engaging professional consultants to assist with these complexities and challenges  and in certain instances are choosing to affiliate with dental management service organizations that can manage the non clinical aspects of dentistry and provide the necessary organizational and operating structure for continued growth and success 
we believe that  similar to other sectors of the health care delivery system  the delivery of dental care is fundamentally a local business 
therefore  we operate our business in a decentralized manner  and each affiliated dental group maintains its local identity and operating philosophy 
in each affiliation  we strive to maintain the local culture of the affiliated dental group  and we encourage it to continue using its name  continue its presence in community events  maintain its relationship with patients and local dental benefit providers and maintain and strengthen the existing management organization 
our affiliation model is designed to create a partnership in management between the affiliated dental group practice and us that allows each party to maximize its strengths and retain its autonomy 
under our affiliation model  the affiliated dentists continue to own their practice and have sole purview over the clinical aspects of the practice while we manage the business aspects of the dental group 
this affiliation model is consistent across all dental group practices and  even where permitted by law  we do not employ practicing dentists 
we believe the core values of a management partnership are shared governance and shared financial objectives and we have structured our affiliation model to achieve these goals 
shared governance is achieved by the formation of a joint policy board for each affiliated dental group which is comprised of an equal number of representatives from the affiliated dental group practice and us 
together  members of the joint policy board develop strategies and decide on major business initiatives 
shared financial objectives are achieved through the joint implementation of an annual planning process that establishes the financial performance standards for the affiliated dental group practice and us 

table of contents affiliated dental group practices from november the date of our first affiliation through december   we completed affiliation transactions  which now comprise dental group practices in states 
the following table lists our affiliated dental group practices as of december  affiliated dental group state dental facilities operatories dental services general endon dontics oral surgery ortho dontics pedo dontics perio dontics prostho dontics st advantage dental massachusetts st advantage dental new york st advantage dental vermont american family dentistry tennessee associated dental care providers arizona chestnut hills dental pennsylvania cumberland dental alabama dental arts center virginia greater maryland dental partners maryland lakeside dental care louisiana longhorn dental associates texas oklahoma dental group oklahoma orthodontic care specialists minnesota park dental minnesota redwood dental group michigan riverside dental group california university dental associates north carolina western new york dental group new york wisconsin dental group wisconsin services provided by specialists who are board certified or board eligible 
accredited by the accreditation association for ambulatory health care aaahc 
university dental associates dental residency program is accredited by the american dental association and winston salem practices are accredited by the aaahc 
operations operating structure we operate under a decentralized organizational structure 
at each dental practice location  where permitted by applicable state law  we generally employ the hygienists  dental assistants and administrative staff  but all clinical activities are performed under the supervision of the dentists 
at each dental practice  a practice manager typically oversees the day to day business operations 
the practice manager and administrative staff are responsible for  among other things  facility staffing  patient scheduling  on site patient billing and ordering office and dental supplies 
each affiliated dental group has a director of operations who is responsible for supervising multiple practice managers if the affiliated dental group has more than one practice location 
we have regional management teams that support the non clinical operations of one or more affiliated dental groups 
these teams provide support in areas such as developing and implementing operating policies and procedures  recruiting  hiring and training staff  administering employee benefits and processing payroll  maintaining information systems  producing accounting and financial reporting information  developing and maintaining facilities  and marketing 
as our smaller affiliated dental groups grow in size  they may add local resources and assume some or all of the support functions provided by regional management teams 
a senior regional operations director is responsible for monitoring the operating performance of multiple affiliated dental groups in multiple markets 
each senior regional operations director participates as a member of the joint policy board of each of the affiliated dental groups for which he or she has management oversight 
table of contents responsibilities 
the senior regional operations directors are responsible for overseeing the development of annual operating plans and monitoring actual results 
on a national level  we support our affiliated dental groups in several ways 
we assist with sharing best clinical practices through our national professional advisory forum  preparing for survey by the accreditation association for ambulatory health care  developing training programs for practice managers and administrative staff  designing  locating and leasing new dental facilities  evaluating capacity  utilization and productivity of dental facilities  evaluating and negotiating dental benefit provider contracts  evaluating and negotiating local practice affiliations  developing and implementing accounting  financial planning and forecasting systems  developing and implementing practice management and other information systems  and negotiating and administering employee benefit plans 
we also take advantage of economies of scale by contracting for various goods and services 
for example  we have arranged for national contracts for the purchase of dental supplies and equipment  long distance telephone services  professional  casualty and general liability insurance  employee benefits such as a k plan  flexible spending program  life insurance and disability insurance and payroll processing 
national professional advisory forum we have organized the national professional advisory forum npaf to facilitate sharing of information by our affiliated dental group practices with respect to the clinical aspects of dentistry 
leading dentists from our affiliated dental group practices are selected to participate in the npaf 
the npaf meets on a national basis and a regional basis each year and provides a forum for dentists to share the best clinical practices of their respective dental group practices and an opportunity for them to build professional relationships with other dental group practices affiliated with us 
these dentists  as a result of their affiliation with us  share common long term goals 
this enables the discussion at the npaf to be more open than it may be with other professional organizations 
while the primary emphasis of the npaf is on the clinical aspects of dentistry  it also provides our management an opportunity to continue to build strong  mutually beneficial partner relationships with our affiliated dental group practices 
accreditation association for ambulatory health care we have selected the accreditation association for ambulatory health care aaahc as means for supporting the quality initiatives of our affiliated dental groups 
the aaahc is a peer based  not for profit organization that is nationally recognized for conducting extensive evaluations of ambulatory health care organizations 
the aaahc evaluates a number of areas in granting accreditation  such as patients rights  governance  administration  clinical records  professional development  quality management and improvement and facilities 
we work with our affiliated dental groups to achieve accreditation 
depending on the level of development and organization of the affiliate  achieving accreditation can take several years of preparation 
currently  seven of our affiliated dental groups have achieved accreditation status from the aaahc 
training and development we believe that quality of care encompasses more than technical dental quality 
it also includes the level of service provided to patients 
improving the level of service provided to patients requires on going training and development of both clinical and administrative staff 
we have devoted significant resources to develop innovative  proprietary training and development programs arranged around three broad areas  leadership excellence  service excellence and technical excellence 
the programs are modular 
modules exist  for example  for improving recruiting skills  developing effective mentoring processes  managing time  improving telephone 
table of contents etiquette and managing customer service 
we make these programs available at the local practice level of the affiliated dental groups and at our national professional advisory forum 
at a local level  we assist our affiliated dental groups in selecting a local person who is responsible for implementing and maintaining continuous training and development programs 
once implemented  our affiliated dental groups have on going sessions with additional modules as they are developed and with new staff members as they join the dental group 
payor relationships and reimbursement mix we believe that our affiliated dental group practices clinical philosophy should not be compromised by economic decisions 
we recognize  however  that the source of payment for services affects operating and financial performance 
we assist our affiliated dental group practices in analyzing their revenue and payor mix on an ongoing basis and recommend methods by which they can improve operating efficiency while not compromising their clinical practice philosophy 
as a general rule  we believe that growth in a market is best facilitated where the payor mix of each of our affiliated dental group practices mirrors the payor mix of its community 
we assist each of our affiliated dental group practices in evaluating and negotiating dental benefit provider contracts 
we believe it is advantageous to be affiliated with dental group practices that have successfully provided care to patients under all reimbursement methodologies 
since a shift is taking place in the dental benefits market from capitated managed care dental plans to ppo plans and dental referral networks  we believe that our affiliates experience in operating under all of these plans provides them with an advantage as it relates to increasing their community presence 
most of our affiliated dental group practices provide care under traditional fee for service plans and non fee for service plans 
the following table provides the aggregate payor mix of our affiliated dental group practices for the years ended december fee for service ppo plans capitated managed care plans in recent years  many of our affiliated dental group practices were challenged with both strong patient demand and tight labor markets 
this combination can create a challenging practice environment which negatively impacts staff retention 
given these dynamics  in selected markets  our affiliated dental group practices have been realigning their reimbursement mix away from deeply discounted dental benefit plans which has resulted in a decrease in capitated managed care plans and in increase in ppo plans 
this realignment has largely been accomplished with the cooperation of the dental benefit provider community in general 
there can be no assurance  however  that continued shift in reimbursement mix will not result in the termination of certain third party payor contracts between our affiliated dental group practices and dental benefit providers that adversely impacts our business  financial condition or results of operations 
facilities development and management we believe an inviting professional environment is a critical aspect of overall patient satisfaction 
generally  each of our dental facilities is constructed to be warm  attractive and inviting to patients in addition to being highly functional 
our dental facilities typically have eight to ten operatories and accommodate general and specialty dentists  hygienists and dental assistants and required support staff 
generally  our facilities are either stand alone or located within a professional office building or medical facility 
we work with each of our affiliated dental groups in analyzing utilization of existing capacity and identifying facility upgrade and expansion priorities 
we also provide our affiliates guidance in the site selection process 
we initially construct each facility as appropriate for the market and add or equip additional operatories as necessary based on capacity and utilization analyses 
during  we expect to complete three de novo dental 
table of contents facilities using a new investment model 
the facilities will be smaller  have a much greater percentage of capital investment that can be readily relocated and have lease terms that are more flexible 
while we believe that this investment model will reduce the risks of de novo facility development  there can be no assuarances that these investments will be successful 
we use architectural design services to improve the facility design process and to ensure that all new facilities are properly constructed and meet the standards set forth by the americans with disabilities act 
to this end  we work with each affiliated dental group to establish a defined set of standards which are consistent with the desires of the affiliated dental group 
we believe such facility standards are necessary to speed the site development process and create consistency across newly developed facilities  leading to enhanced productivity of dentists  hygienists and support staff 
financial planning and financial information system we assist our affiliated dental groups with financial planning 
in conjunction with each affiliated dental group  we develop on an annual basis an operating plan for the affiliated dental group which sets specific goals for revenue growth  operating expenses and capital expenditures 
once a plan has been approved by the joint policy board  we measure the financial performance of each affiliated dental group  which includes both the affiliated dental group practice and us  on a monthly basis and compare actual performance to plan 
our financial information system enables us to measure  monitor and compare the financial performance of each affiliated dental group on a standardized basis 
the system also allows us to track and control costs and facilitates the accounting and financial reporting process 
this financial system is used with all of our affiliated dental groups 
practice management systems our affiliated dental group practices use various dental practice management software systems to facilitate patient scheduling  to bill patients and insurance companies  to assist with facility staffing and for other practice related activities 
in connection with our affiliation with park dental  we acquired the rights to comdent  a practice management system designed for use by multi specialty dental groups 
comdent has been used continuously at park dental since and continuously enhanced by park dental and us since we believe that comdent s scheduling  electronic data interchange and data management features are superior to others that are commercially available 
in addition  comdent is scalable and capable of accommodating large  multi site dental groups 
we have converted ten of our multi specialty dental groups to comdent 
four of our multi specialty dental groups use quality systems  inc s commercially available practice management system  and the remaining four of our multi specialty dental groups use various other commercially available practice management systems 
orthodontic care specialists  our affiliated dental group which exclusively provides orthodontic services  utilizes a proprietary practice management system designed specifically for the unique requirements of the orthodontics specialty 
we have implemented this orthodontic practice management system at a number of our multispecialty dental groups which have a significant orthodontics practice 
since october  we have been developing improvis  a replacement system to comdent  for use by our affiliated dental group practices 
improvis is being developed in phases  with the completion of the first phase now scheduled for the second quarter of when all phases are complete  improvis will include expanded clinical  managerial  and financial capabilities 
as of december   improvis had been implemented at three practice locations as part of the first phase of development 
upon completion of the first phase which is scheduled for  we intend to implement improvis at several of our affiliated dental group practices 
there can be no assurance  however  that all phases of improvis will be successfully developed  that improvis will function satisfactorily in the practice environment on a large scale or that we will successfully implement improvis at several of our affiliated dental group practices during 
table of contents affiliation structure we have entered into a service agreement with each affiliated dental group practice  or professional corporation pc  pursuant to which we perform all administrative  non clinical aspects of the dental group 
we expect that each new affiliated pc will enter into a similar service agreement or become a party to an existing service agreement at the time of affiliation with us 
we are dependent on our service agreements for the vast majority of our operating revenue 
each of our service agreements with park dental and wisconsin dental group represented greater than or our consolidated net revenue in the termination of one or more of our service agreements could have a material adverse effect on us 
pursuant to the service agreement  the affiliated pc is responsible for all clinical aspects of the dental operations of the affiliated dental group 
these clinical aspects include recruiting and hiring dentists  other licensed dental personnel and unlicensed dental assistants necessary to provide dental care  providing dental care  implementing and maintaining quality assurance and peer review programs  setting patient fee schedules  entering into dental benefit plan provider contracts and maintaining professional and comprehensive general liability insurance covering the pc and each of its dentists 
we do not assume any authority  responsibility  supervision or control over the provision of dental care to patients 
the service agreement also requires the affiliated pc to abide by non competition and confidentiality provisions 
the non competition provisions of the service agreement prohibit the affiliated pc from owning or operating a dental facility  or having any interest in any business which competes with us  within the contractually agreed upon service territory 
the affiliated pc is not restricted from owning and operating a dental practice outside of the agreed upon service territory  including providing for the administrative aspects of that practice 
the service agreement requires the affiliated pc to enter into an employment or independent contractor agreement with each dentist retained by the affiliated pc 
the employment agreements with full time dentists who are owners of the affiliated pcs at the time of affiliation with us generally are for a specified initial term of up to five years and may not be terminated by the dentists without cause during the initial term 
the employment agreements with other dentists generally are for a term of months  but may have longer terms  and are usually terminable by either the affiliated pc or the dentist upon advance written notice  which in most cases is days  and are terminable by the pc for cause immediately upon written notice to the dentist 
unless prohibited by state law  these agreements typically contain non competition provisions which prohibit a dentist from engaging in the practice of dentistry or otherwise performing professional dental services within a specified geographic area  usually a specified number of miles from the relevant dental facility  following termination 
the non competition restrictions are generally for one to two years following termination 
pursuant to the service agreement  we are responsible for providing all services necessary for the administration of the non clinical aspects of the dental operations of the affiliated dental group 
these services include assisting with organizational planning and development  providing recruiting  retention and training programs  supporting quality assurance initiatives of the affiliated dental group  providing on going facilities development  maintenance and management  administering employee benefits and payroll  procuring supplies and other necessary resources  maintaining necessary information systems  assisting with marketing and payor relations  and providing financial planning  reporting and analysis 
as mandated by the service agreement  we and each affiliated pc establish a joint policy board which is responsible for developing and implementing management and administrative policies for the affiliated dental group 
the joint policy board consists of an equal number of representatives designated by us and the affiliated pc 
the joint policy board members designated by the affiliated pc must be licensed dentists employed by the affiliated pc 
the joint policy board s responsibilities include the review and approval of the long term strategic and short term operational goals  objectives  and plans for the dental facilities  all annual capital and operating plans  all renovation and expansion plans and capital equipment expenditures with respect to the dental facilities  all advertising and marketing services  and staffing plans regarding provider and support personnel for the affiliated dental group 
the joint policy board also reviews and monitors the financial performance of the affiliated dental group and the affiliated pc with respect to the attainment of the affiliated dental group s and the 
table of contents affiliated pc s financial goals 
the joint policy board also has the authority to approve or disapprove any merger or combination with  or acquisition of  any dental practice by the affiliated pc 
finally  the joint policy board reviews and makes recommendations with respect to contractual relationships between the affiliated pc and dental benefit providers and the affiliated pc s patient fee schedules  although these and all other clinical decisions  as enumerated above  remain the exclusive decision of the affiliated pc through its joint policy board members 
the pc reimburses us for actual expenses incurred on its behalf in connection with the operation and administration of the dental facilities and pays fees to us for management services and capital provided 
under certain service agreements  our service fee consists entirely of a fixed monthly fee determined by agreement between us and the affiliated pc in a formal budgeting process 
under certain service agreements  our service fee consists of a monthly fee equal to the prior year service fee and an additional performance fee based upon a percentage of the increase of the amount by which the affiliated dental group practice s adjusted gross revenue exceeds expenses as compared to the prior year 
in no event  however  under these service agreements will the total service fee be greater than the affiliated dental group practice s adjusted gross revenue less expenses 
under certain service agreements  our service fee consists of a monthly fee which is based upon a specified percentage of the amount by which the pc s adjusted gross revenue exceeds expenses 
under a certain service agreement our service fees consists of a fixed monthly fee and an additional performance fee based upon a percentage of the amount by which the pc s adjusted gross revenue exceeds expenses as compared to the budgeted amount for the current year 
the structure of the service fee  whether comprised of variable  fixed and variable or fixed components  is dependent in part on laws of each state in which we operate 
the pc is also responsible for provider expenses  which generally consist of the salaries  benefits  and certain other expenses of the dentists 
pursuant to the terms of the service agreements  we bill patients and third party payors on behalf of the affiliated pcs 
such funds are applied in the following order of priority reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with the operation and administration of the dental facilities  repayment of advances  if any  made by us to the pc  payment of the monthly fee  payment of provider expenses  and payment of the additional variable fee  as applicable 
each of our current service agreements is for an initial term of years and automatically renews for successive five year terms  unless terminated by notice given at least days prior to the end of the initial term or any renewal term 
in addition  the service agreement may be terminated earlier by either party upon the occurrence of certain events involving the other party  such as our dissolution  bankruptcy  liquidation  or our failure  which continues through the applicable notice and cure period  to perform our material duties and obligations under the service agreement 
in the event a service agreement is terminated  the related affiliated pc is required to reimburse us for unpaid expenses incurred in connection with the operation and administration of the dental facilities  repay advances and pay us for unpaid service fees 
in addition  the related affiliated pc is required  at our option in nearly all instances  to purchase the unamortized balance of intangible assets at the current book value  purchase other assets at the greater of fair market value or book value  and assume our leases and other liabilities related to the performance of our obligations under the service agreement 
competition the dental services industry is highly competitive 
our affiliated dental group practices compete with other dental group practices and individual dentists in their respective markets 
we estimate that we compete with approximately ten companies in our current service areas that provide business services to dentists and dental group practices through service agreement arrangements 
we believe that the principal factors of competition between companies that provide business services to dental group practices are their affiliation methods and models  the number and reputation of their existing affiliates  their management expertise and experience  the sophistication of their management information  accounting  finance and other systems  their operating methods 
table of contents and access to capital 
we believe that we compete effectively with other companies that provide business services to dental group practices with respect to these factors 
government regulation general the practice of dentistry is highly regulated  and our operations and those of our affiliated dental group practices are subject to numerous state and federal laws and regulations 
furthermore  we may become subject to additional laws and regulations as we expand into new markets 
there can be no assurance that the regulatory environment in which we and our affiliated dental group practices operate will not change significantly in the future 
our ability to operate profitably will depend  in part  upon us and our affiliated dental group practices obtaining and maintaining all necessary licenses  certifications and other approvals and operating in compliance with applicable laws 
in light of this  our service agreements provide that if there is any change in any law or regulation  or any ruling or interpretation by any court or governing body  that materially and adversely affects the way in which either party is to perform or be compensated under the service agreement  or which makes the service agreement unlawful  then the parties are obligated to use their best efforts to revise their relationship in a way that complies with the applicable regulatory development and approximates as closely as possible the economic positions of the parties prior to that development 
state regulation each state imposes licensing and other requirements on dentists 
the laws of almost all states in which we currently operate prohibit  either by specific statutes  case law or as a matter of general public policy  entities not wholly owned or controlled by dentists  such as american dental partners  from practicing dentistry  employing dentists and  in certain circumstances  dental assistants and dental hygienists  exercising control over the provision of dental services  splitting fees or receiving fees for patient referrals 
many states prohibit or restrict the ability of a person other than a licensed dentist to own  manage or control the assets  equipment or offices used in a dental practice 
the laws of some states prohibit the advertising of dental services under a trade or corporate name and require all advertisements to be in the name of the dentist 
a number of states also regulate the content of advertisements of dental services and the use of promotional gift items 
these laws and their interpretation vary from state to state and are enforced by regulatory authorities with broad discretion 
there are certain regulatory issues associated with our role in negotiating and administering managed care contracts 
to the extent that we or any affiliated dental group practice contracts with third party payors  including self insured plans  under a capitated or other arrangement which causes us or such affiliated dental group practice to assume a portion of the financial risk of providing dental care  we or such affiliated dental group practice may become subject to state insurance laws 
if we or any affiliated dental group practice is determined to be engaged in the business of insurance  we may be required to change the method of payment from third party payors or to seek appropriate licensure 
any regulation of us or our affiliated dental group practices under insurance laws could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
through our role in negotiating and administering managed care and other provider contracts  we are also subject to regulation in certain states as an administrator and must ensure that our activities comply with relevant regulation 
many states laws and regulations relating to the practice of dentistry were adopted prior to the emergence of providers of business services to dental group practices like us 
as a result  a number of states  including states in which we currently operate  are in the process of reviewing and or amending their laws or regulations relating to the practice of dentistry and dentists business arrangements with unlicensed persons like us 
there can be no assurance that any amendments or new laws or regulations  or the interpretation or application of existing or new laws or regulations  will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents federal regulation the dental industry is also regulated at the federal level to the extent that dental services are reimbursed under federal programs 
participation by the affiliated dental group practices and their dentists in such programs subjects them  and potentially us  to significant regulation regarding the provision of services to beneficiaries  submission of claims and related matters  including the types of regulations discussed below 
violation of these laws or regulations can result in civil and criminal penalties  including possible exclusion of individuals and entities from participation in federal payment programs 
the federal anti kickback statutes prohibit  in part  and subject to certain safe harbors  the payment or receipt of remuneration in return for  or in order to induce  referrals  or arranging for referrals  for items or services which are reimbursable under federal payment programs 
other federal laws impose significant penalties for false or improper billings or inappropriate coding for dental services regardless of the payor source 
the federal self referral law  or stark law  prohibits dentists from making referrals for certain designated health services reimbursable under federal payment programs to entities with which they have financial relationships unless a specific exception applies 
the stark law also prohibits the entity receiving such referrals from submitting a claim for services provided pursuant to such referral 
we may be subject to federal payor rules prohibiting the assignment of the right to receive payment for services rendered unless certain conditions are met 
these rules prohibit a billing agent from receiving a fee based on a percentage of collections and may require payments for the services of the dentists to be made directly to the dentist providing the services or to a lock box account held in the name of the dentist or his or her dental group 
in addition  these rules provide that accounts receivable from federal payors are not saleable or assignable 
finally  dental practices are also subject to compliance with federal regulatory standards in the areas of safety  health and access 
insurance we maintain insurance coverage that we believe is appropriate for our business  including property casualty  business interruption  workers compensation and general liability  among others 
in addition  our affiliated dental group practices are required to maintain  or cause to be maintained  professional liability insurance with us as a named insured 
while we believe that our current insurance coverage is adequate for our current operations  it may not be sufficient for all future claims 
in addition  the costs  retention levels and availability of certain insurance have fluctuated significantly in recent years  and there can be no assurance that our current insurance coverages will continue to be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost in the future or that reserve estimates for potential losses below applicable retention levels under certain insurance coverages will be sufficient 
employees as of december   we employed  people 
this included hygienists and dental assistants and administrative and management personnel located at our dental facilities  local management offices and our corporate office 
in addition  we are affiliated with dentists  as well as hygienists and dental assistants located in states which prohibit our employment of dental assistants and or hygienists  all of whom were employees or independent contractors of their respective affiliated pcs

under our service agreements  we are responsible for providing all services necessary for the administration of the non clinical aspects of the dental operations 
the pc is responsible for the provision of dental care 
each of our service agreements is for an initial term of years 
during  and  we completed five  seven and four transactions in which we acquired non clinical dental assets  respectively  and simultaneously entered into year service agreements in two of these transactions the assets of fourteen of the transactions were combined with existing affiliated dental group practices 
in total  these sixteen affiliations resulted in the addition of dental facilities and operatories 
in addition during  we acquired the outstanding stock of a dental laboratory and selected assets of a second laboratory 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on acquisitions and affiliations 
we are constantly evaluating potential affiliations with dental group practices and acquisition of companies that would expand our business capabilities 
the number of new affiliations and acquisitions over the next twelve months could be at levels greater or less than we have achieved in recent years 
revenue overview net revenue net revenue comprises fees earned under service agreements from our affiliated dental group practices  fees received from dental benefit providers related to the arrangement of the provision of care to patients and dental laboratory fees 

table of contents the following table sets forth for  and  the components of net revenue in our consolidated statements of income in thousands reimbursement of expenses business service fees net revenue earned under service agreements other revenue net revenue fees earned under service agreements include reimbursement of expenses incurred by us on behalf of the affiliated dental group practices in connection with the operation and administration of dental facilities and service fees charged to the affiliated dental group practices pursuant to the terms of the service agreements for management services and capital provided by us 
under certain service agreements  representing of our service fees  our service fee consists entirely of a fixed monthly fee determined by agreement of us and the affiliated dental group practice in a formal budgeting process 
under certain service agreements  representing of our service fees  our service fee consists of a monthly fee equal to the prior year service fee and an additional performance fee based upon a percentage of the increase of the amount by which the affiliated dental group practice s adjusted gross revenue exceeds expenses as compared to the prior year 
in no event  however  under these service agreements will the total service fee be greater than the affiliated dental group practice s adjusted gross revenue less expenses 
under certain service agreements  representing of our service fees  our service fee consists of a monthly fee which is based upon a specified percentage of the amount by which the affiliated dental group practice s adjusted gross revenue exceeds expenses 
under a certain service agreement  representing of our service fees  our service fee consists of a fixed monthly fee and an additional performance fee based upon a percentage of the amount by which the affiliated dental group practice s adjusted gross revenue exceeds expenses as compared to the budgeted amount for the current year 
in all instances  the service fee is negotiated as fair market value for services and capital provided by us to our affiliated dental group practices 
as part of our objective of being the leading provider of services to dental group practices  we are continually expanding our resources and capabilities  including vertical integration of ancillary dental activities 
we work with and receive fees from dental benefit providers on behalf of our affiliates to arrange programs for the provision of care to their patients 
in  we acquired two dental laboratories to expand our procurement capabilities 
although both activities earn revenue from dental practices not affiliated with us  we expect that the growth of both of these activities will come primarily from the growth of our affiliated dental group practices 
for additional information on components of our net revenue  see note of notes of consolidated financial statements 
adjusted gross revenue of the affiliated dental group practices although we do not own or control the affiliated dental group practices or pcs and  accordingly  do not consolidate the financial statements of the pcs with ours  we believe it is important to understand the revenue of the affiliated dental group practices 
the affiliated dental group practices generate revenue from patients and dental benefit providers under fee for service  ppo plans and capitated managed care plans 
the affiliated dental group practices record revenue at established rates reduced by contractual adjustments and allowances for doubtful accounts to arrive at adjusted gross revenue 
contractual adjustments represent the difference between gross billable charges at established rates and the portion of those charges reimbursed pursuant to certain dental benefit plan provider contracts 
after collection of fees from patients and insurers for the provision of dental care and reimbursement of expenses and payment of fees to us  the amounts retained by the affiliated dental group practices are used for compensation of dentists and in certain states where the affiliated dental group practices must employ dental hygienists and or dental assistants  compensation of such non dentist employees 

table of contents the affiliated dental group practices reimburse us for expenses incurred on their behalf in connection with the operation and administration of the dental facilities and pay fees to us for business services 
expenses incurred for the operation and administration of the dental facilities include salaries and benefits for non dentist personnel working at the dental facilities the administrative staff and  where permitted by law  the dental assistants and hygienists  lab fees  dental supplies  office occupancy costs of the dental facilities  depreciation related to the fixed assets at the dental facilities and other expenses such as professional fees  marketing costs and general and administrative expenses

concurrently  the dental industry is witnessing growth in ppo plans 
we anticipate that our affiliated dental group practices will continue to witness growth in ppo plans and potentially a reduction in capitated managed care plans 
this change in reimbursement mix has largely been accomplished with the cooperation of the dental benefit provider community in general 
there can be no assurance  however  that the shift in reimbursement mix will not result in the termination of certain third party payor contracts 
results of operations net revenue net revenue increased from  in to  in and to  in during  of the increase was attributable to the current year impact of entering into service agreements in connection with affiliation transactions during and and of the increase was due to same market net revenue growth from our affiliated dental group practices  offset by a decrease in other revenue 
during  the increase was attributable to a increase in same market net revenue growth from our affiliated dental group practices and incremental net revenue earned from our platform affiliation completed in may  offset by a decrease in other revenue 
the decrease in other revenue in and is primarily attributable to a decrease in dental laboratory fees as a result of an increasing percentage of fees being earned from our affiliated dental groups 
net revenue derived from our service agreement with park dental represented approximately  and of our consolidated net revenue for  and  respectively 
net revenue from our service agreement with wisconsin dental group represented approximately  and of our consolidated net revenue for  and  respectively 
no other service agreement or customers accounted for greater than of our consolidated net revenue 

table of contents although we do not own or control our affiliated dental group practices  we believe that it is more meaningful to analyze our revenue  expenses and margins in terms of total revenue  which includes the adjusted gross revenue of our affiliated dental group practices  the fees we receive from dental benefit providers related to the arrangement of the provision of care to patients and our dental laboratory fees 
total revenue and adjusted gross revenue are not measures of financial performance under gaap  but our expenses and business services fees are incurred or earned in support of the adjusted gross revenue of our affiliated dental group practices 
we use these and other non gaap financial measures to analyze operating trends and to help manage our business

same market affiliate adjusted gross revenue growth was in for and  same market affiliate adjusted gross revenue growth excludes platform affiliations that occurred after january  and january   respectively

table of contents since  we have entered into affiliation transactions with a number of dental group practices located in states where dental hygienists and dental assistants are required to be employed by the affiliated dental group practices 
the increase in amounts retained by affiliated dental group practices as a percentage of adjusted gross revenue in was mainly attributable to entering into affiliations where dental hygienists and dental assistants are employed by the affiliated dental group practices 
additionally  in  there was an increase in health and workers compensation insurance costs of  representing a increase over the prior year 
the increase in amounts retained by affiliated dental group practices as a percentage of adjusted gross revenue in was mainly a result of greater profitability levels at our affiliated dental group practices 
the following table sets forth for  and same market affiliate adjusted gross revenue  percentage change and a reconciliation to net revenue in thousands twelve months ended december  change twelve months ended december  change adjusted gross revenue affiliated dental group practices dental groups affiliated with the company in both periods of comparison dental groups that completed affiliations with the company during periods of comparison total adjusted gross revenue affiliated dental group practices other revenue total revenue amounts retained by affiliated dental group practices net revenue salaries and benefits salaries and benefits expense includes costs for personnel working for us at the dental facilities  dental laboratory and regional management 
at the facility level  we generally employ the administrative staff and  where permitted by state law  the dental hygienists and dental assistants 
the local and regional operating management teams supervise and support the staff at the dental facilities 
salaries and benefits expense as a percentage of total revenue decreased from in to in and in the decrease in was attributable to entering into affiliations during and where the affiliated dental group practices were required to employ the dental hygienists and dental assistants  thereby lowering our salaries and benefits expense in relation to net revenue earned  in addition to staff productivity increases 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in health insurance costs of  representing a increase over the decrease in was primarily attributable to staff productivity increases 
lab fees and dental supplies lab fees and dental supplies expense varies from affiliate to affiliate and is affected by the volume and type of procedures performed 
lab fees and dental supplies expense as a percentage of total revenue was in  in and in the decrease as a percentage of total revenue in was primarily attributable to a new pricing arrangement negotiated with our primary dental supply vendor as well as continued 
table of contents efforts to manage these expenses 
the decrease as a percentage of total revenue in was primarily related to increased utilization of our dental laboratory by our affiliated dental groups and to a lesser extent our continued focus on managing dental supplies expenses 
office occupancy office occupancy expense includes rent expense and certain other operating costs  such as utilities  associated with dental facilities  dental laboratory and the local and regional administrative offices 
such costs vary based on the size of each facility and the market rental rate for dental office space in each particular geographic market 
office occupancy expense as a percentage of total revenue was in  in and in the decreases in and were primarily attributable to higher utilization of our dental facilities as evidenced by a higher level of total revenue per facility in and in  we added one new dental facility and relocated and or expanded ten facilities 
in  we relocated and or expanded sixteen facilities 
in  we completed one de novo facility and relocated and or expanded facilities 
other operating expenses other operating expenses include non employment related insurance expense  professional fees  marketing costs and other general and administrative expenses 
other operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue were in  in and in other operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue in decreased slightly due to our effort to manage these expenses  offset by increased insurance costs of  representing a increase over the increase in was the result of an additional  of minnesota care tax expense  representing a increase over  due to a rate increase and additional revenues for the affiliated dental group practices in minnesota 
this was partially offset by a  reduction to professional liability insurance reserves due to revised actuarial estimates 
general corporate expenses general corporate expenses consist of compensation and travel expenses for our corporate personnel and administrative staff  facility and other administrative costs of our corporate office and professional fees  including legal and accounting 
general corporate expenses as a percentage of total revenue were in  in and in the increase in was mainly due to our management incentive compensation plan  the addition of new management positions and increased benefit costs  partially offset by the favorable impact of a legal settlement during the increase in was primarily due to costs for compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  new hires at our corporate office  increases in our incentive compensation plan and the favorable impact of a legal settlement during external costs to comply with section were approximately  in while we cannot currently estimate the expected costs for on going compliance in future periods  we do expect them to be significant 
depreciation depreciation expense includes charges related to leasehold improvements and furniture  fixtures and equipment used to operate the dental facilities  lab facility  local and regional management offices and our corporate office 
depreciation expense as a percentage of total revenue was in  in and in the stability in depreciation expense as a percentage of total revenue was the result of higher utilization of our dental facilities as evidenced by a higher level of adjusted gross revenue per facility from year to year  offset by the relocation expansion of dental facilities  the completion of a new dental facility in  the relocation of our dental laboratory in and new affiliations completed over the last two years 
we expect to continue to invest in the development of new dental facilities and the relocation and or expansion of existing dental facilities in accordingly  depending on the amount and timing of such future capital expenditures  depreciation may increase in at a rate greater than total revenue 

table of contents amortization of intangible assets amortization expense as a percentage of total revenue decreased from in to in and in the decrease was a result of a greater proportion of our revenue growth coming from existing operations as opposed to entering into additional affiliations over the last two years 
amortization of intangible assets could increase in the future as a result of definite lived intangibles recorded in connection with future affiliations  acquisitions and existing affiliation contingent payments 
special charges special charges of  in represent a reversal of the estimated provision for costs associated with reductions in physical capacity at associated dental care providers and patient communications at associated dental care providers and park dental as a result of managed care contract terminations in earnings from operations earnings from operations increased from  or of total revenue  in to  or of total revenue  in and to  or of total revenue  in earnings from operations as a percentage of total revenue increased in and primarily due to increased productivity and facility utilization as a result of higher same market growth rates and to a lesser extent improved management of lab fees and dental supplies expenses 
in this was partially offset by increased general corporate expenses as a result of additional personnel at our corporate offices and accounting fees incurred to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of interest expense net interest expense decreased from  in to  in and  in the decrease in was due to a lower overall interest rate and a lower average debt balance compared to the prior year 
net interest expense in was partially offset by the expensing of  of unamortized debt issuance costs as part of terminating our existing credit facility and entering into a new credit facility in october the decrease in was due to reduced debt levels  a reduction in borrowing spread over libor and to a lesser extent a lower libor interest rate as compared to the prior year 
see the liquidity and capital resources section for more information related to our credit facility 
income taxes our effective tax rate was approximately for  in and in the changes in our effective tax rate from to were due to fluctuations in taxable income in various states in which we operate and recording additional expense in net income net income increased from  or of total revenue  in to  or of total revenue  in and to  or of total revenue  in net income as a percentage of total revenue in compared to increased primarily due to increased earnings from operations  as discussed above  and reduced borrowing costs  partially offset by an increase in our effective tax rate 
net income as a percentage of total revenue in compared to increased primarily due to increased earnings from operations  as discussed above  reduced borrowing costs and a decrease in our effective tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operating and capital needs  including cash used for acquisitions and affiliations  capital expenditures and working capital  from sales of equity securities  borrowings under our revolving line of credit and cash generated from operations 

table of contents from january  through december   we completed twelve dental practice affiliations for aggregate consideration of  in cash   in subordinated promissory notes and  in deferred payments 
in  we completed an affiliation which included a future contingent payment based on a multiple of earnings before interest and taxes in excess of a predetermined threshold for the twelve months ended december  less capital expenditures incurred during the period 
the amount of the contingent payment is  and will paid in in future years  this contingent payment will result in additional annual amortization expense of  for the years ended december  and  cash provided by operating activities amounted to  and  respectively 
in  cash from operations primarily resulted from net earnings after adding back non cash items  a decrease in receivables due from affiliated dental group practices and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and accrued compensation 
the decrease in receivables due from affiliated dental group practices  which totaled  was primarily due to better working capital management and a continued focus on receivables management at our affiliated dental group practices 
the days sales outstanding for the patient receivables of our affiliated dental group practices decreased from days at december  to days at december  in  cash from operations primarily resulted from net earnings after adding back non cash items and a decrease in receivables due from affiliated dental group practices 
the decrease in receivables due from affiliated dental group practices  which totaled  was primarily due to better working capital management and a continued focus on receivables management at our affiliated dental group practices 
the days sales outstanding for the patient receivables of our affiliated dental group practices decreased from days at december  to days at december  we do not expect the days sales outstanding of our affiliated dental group practices to decrease in future years to a similar extent as the improvement achieved during the past two years 
for the years ended december  and  cash used in investing activities amounted to  and  respectively 
cash used for investing activities included cash for affiliations  acquisitions and capital expenditures 
cash used for acquisitions and affiliations  net of cash acquired  was  and  for and  respectively 
capital expenditures were  and  for and  respectively 
capital expenditures for included costs associated with the relocation and or expansion of fourteen dental facilities along with combining our two dental laboratories into one new laboratory facility 
capital expenditures for included costs associated with adding one dental facility and the relocation and or expansion of nineteen dental facilities 
we expect that capital expenditures in to be higher than in past years due to the development of new dental facilities and the relocation and or expansion of existing dental facilities  our on going facility maintenance capital expenditure program and investment in several information technology projects 
for the years ended december  and  cash used for financing activities amounted to  and  respectively 
cash used for financing activities in resulted from net repayments under our revolving line of credit of  repayment of indebtedness of  and payment of debt issuance costs as part of entering into a new credit facility of  offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock from stock option exercises and for our employee stock purchase plan of  and  respectively 
cash used for financing activities in resulted from net repayments under our revolving line of credit of  repayment of indebtedness of  and payment of debt issuance costs as part of entering into a new credit facility of  offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock from stock option exercises and for our employee stock purchase plan of  and  respectively 
we have a credit facility that is used for general corporate purposes  including working capital  affiliations  acquisitions and capital expenditures 
the credit facility was scheduled to mature in october and the maximum principal amount is  the credit facility was scheduled to be reduced to  in 
table of contents october borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at either prime or libor plus a margin  at our option 
the margin was based upon our debt coverage ratio and ranges from to for prime borrowings and to for libor borrowings 
at december   the libor interest rate under the credit facility  including borrowing margin  was approximately and the prime interest rate under the credit facility was 
in addition  we pay a commitment fee which ranges from to of the average daily unused balance of the credit facility line 
borrowings are limited to an availability formula based on earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization  adjusted for certain items 
the credit facility is collateralized by a first lien on substantially all of our assets  including a pledge of the stock of our subsidiaries 
we are also required to comply with financial and other covenants 
the financial covenants include a minimum net worth  leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and maximum capital expenditures as defined by the credit facility agreement 
we were in compliance with our covenants as of december  the outstanding balance under this line as of december  was  the unused balance at december  was  and based on borrowing covenants  was available for borrowing 
on february   we amended our credit facility as a result of our improved financial position and to take advantage of the favorable credit markets 
the amended credit facility matures in february and the maximum principal is  the amended credit facility will be reduced to  in february other major changes from the original credit facility are a decrease in the margin based upon our debt coverage ratio ranging from to for prime borrowings and to for libor borrowings and a decrease in our commitment fee range to to 
our growth to date has resulted in large measure from our ability to affiliate with additional dental practices 
historically  we have used a combination of cash  subordinated debt and common stock as consideration for past affiliations and acquisitions and plan to use these sources in the future 
in recent years  the consideration paid has consisted of cash and subordinated debt 
in the event that our common stock does not maintain sufficient valuation or if potential affiliation or acquisition candidates are unwilling to accept our securities as consideration  we will continue to use cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility for future affiliations and acquisitions 
if cash flow from operations is not sufficient or financing is not available as needed on terms acceptable to us  our affiliation and acquisition strategy will be modified 
we are constantly evaluating potential affiliations with dental group practices and acquisition of companies that would expand our business capabilities 
the number of new affiliations and acquisitions over the next twelve months could be at levels greater than we have achieved during each of the past two years 
we believe that cash generated from operations and amounts available under our current revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures  affiliations and acquisitions for at least the next twelve months 
any excess cash will be used to reduce indebtedness or to repurchase common stock through our previously announced repurchase program  pursuant to which approximately  remains available to repurchase additional shares

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis management evaluates its estimates  including those related to the carrying value of receivables due from affiliated dental group practices  goodwill  other intangible assets and insurance liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
valuation of receivables due from affiliated dental group practices the company s carrying amount of receivables due from affiliated dental group practices requires management to assess the collectibility of our business fees 
our fees are dependent on the economic viability of the affiliated dental group practices based on actual and expected future financial performance including collectibility of the affiliated dental group practices patient receivables  net of contractual adjustments and allowances for doubtful accounts 
the affiliated dental group practices record revenue at established rates reduced by contractual adjustments and allowances for doubtful accounts to arrive at adjusted gross revenue 
contractual adjustments represent the difference between gross billable charges at established rates and the portion of those charges reimbursed pursuant to certain dental benefit plan provider contracts 
for contracts where there is no defined benefit  contractual adjustments are based upon historical collection experience and other relevant factors 
the affiliated dental group practices provision for doubtful accounts is estimated in the period that services are rendered and adjusted in future periods as necessary 
the estimates for the provision and related allowance are based on an evaluation of historical collection experience  the aging profile of the accounts receivable  write off percentages and other relevant factors 
changes in these factors in future periods could result in increases or decreases in the provision 
in the event that final reimbursement or bad debt experience differs from original estimates  adjustments to the affiliated dental group practices patient receivables would be required which may impact the collectibility of receivables due from affiliated dental group practices 
to date we have not recorded any losses related to our receivables due from affiliated dental group practices 
goodwill and other intangible assets our business acquisitions and affiliations typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we may incur 
the determination of the value of such goodwill and intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
as part of each affiliation and acquisition  we determine the amount of goodwill and intangible assets related to the transaction 
in determining the amount of goodwill or intangible assets we estimate the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
in determining fair value  we review the balance sheet of the acquired company to ensure the reasonableness of the balances  including the collectibility of receivables  value of inventory on hand  replacement value and depreciable lives of property and equipment and appropriate level of accrued liabilities 
in determining the amount of intangible assets related to customer relationships as part of an acquisition  we estimate future discounted cash flows based on many factors  including historical and projected 
table of contents revenue streams and operating margins and customer attrition rates 
if the facts and circumstances change indicating that the fair value of tangible net assets or intangible assets should change  future period results could be impacted 
for definite lived intangible assets related to service agreements  we evaluate the amortization period based on the facts and circumstances of each individual affiliation 
our evaluation includes reviewing historical and projected operating results  dental benefit plan provider contracts  customer and patient stability and market presence in the geographic area that we are entering  along with other relevant factors 
the initial amortization period for definite lived intangibles is generally to years 
if circumstances change  indicating a shorter estimated period of benefit  future amortization expense could increase 
we perform an impairment test on goodwill on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred 
we determine impairment by comparing the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting units 
we determine the fair value of each reporting unit based on discounted future cash flows using a discount reflecting our average cost of funds 
if impairment were determined  we would make the appropriate adjustment to goodwill to reduce the asset s carrying value 
we perform an impairment test on definite lived intangibles when facts and circumstances exist which would suggest that the intangibles may be impaired 
we review the undiscounted net cash flows of the asset to the carrying value of the intangible asset and projected revenue streams when performing the impairment test on intangible assets 
if impairment was determined  we would make the appropriate adjustment to the intangible assets to reduce the asset s carrying value to fair value 
insurance we maintain various insurance coverages for our business  including property casualty  business interruption  workers compensation and general liability  among others 
in addition  our affiliated dental group practices are required to maintain  or cause to be maintained  professional liability insurance with us as a named insured 
several of these insurance programs have retention levels in which we are financially obligated for insured losses below certain financial thresholds before the insurer is financially obligated for insured losses 
we maintain reserves for losses below retention levels for certain of these programs 
reserves are based upon estimates provided by third party actuaries or by individual case basis valuations 
changes in trends of loss severity or loss frequency may affect the calculation of these estimates and create the need for subsequent adjustments to estimated loss reserves

risk factors we are dependent on the performance of our affiliated dental group practices for our revenue our net revenue depends primarily on revenue generated by dental group practices  or professional corporations  with which we affiliate 
we do not employ dentists or control the clinical decisions of the affiliated 
table of contents dental group practices 
there can be no assurance that affiliated dental group practices will maintain successful operations or that any of the key members of a particular dental group practice will continue practicing with that practice 
availability of dentists  hygienists or assistants could have a material adverse effect on our business 
to the extent permitted by state law  each affiliated dental group practice has entered into non competition agreements and other restrictive covenants with dentists under their employ 
there can be no assurance that these restrictive covenants are or will be sufficient to protect the interests of the affiliated dental group practices or that a court would enforce such agreements 
any material loss of revenue by the affiliated dental group practices  whether through the loss of existing dentists  the inability to attract new dentists or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are dependent upon the service agreements we have entered into with each of our affiliated dental group practices for substantially all of our net revenue 
revenue generated from our service agreement with two of those affiliated dental group practices  park dental and wisconsin dental group  represented approximately and of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended december   respectively 
the termination of these service agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any material loss in revenue by one or more affiliated dental group practice would have a material adverse effect on its ability to reimburse us for expenses and to pay service fees 
the failure to receive such amounts could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  in the event of a breach of a service agreement by an affiliated dental group practice  there can be no assurance that the remedies available to us under the service agreements would be enforceable or would be adequate to compensate us for our damages resulting from such breach 
our net revenues may be adversely affected by third party payor cost containment efforts and capitation arrangements a significant portion of the payments for dental care that is received by the affiliated dental group practices is paid or reimbursed under insurance programs with third party payors 
while payor mix varies from market to market  the aggregate payor mix percentage of our affiliated group practices for the year ended december  was approximately fee for service  ppo plans and capitated managed care plans 
third party payors are continually negotiating the fees charged for dental care  with a goal of containing reimbursement and utilization rates 
loss of revenue by our affiliated dental group practices caused by third party payor cost containment efforts could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  some third party payor contracts are capitated arrangements 
under such contracts  the affiliated dental group practice receives a capitated payment  calculated on a per member per month basis  to provide care to the covered enrollees and generally receives a co payment from the patient at the time care is provided 
such payment methods shift a portion of the risk of providing care from the third party payors to the affiliated dental group practice 
to the extent that patients covered by such contracts require more frequent or extensive care than is anticipated  there may be a shortfall between the capitated payments received by the affiliated dental group practice and the costs to provide the contracted services 
these shortfalls may impact us by the possible reduction in expense reimbursement and service fees from the affiliated dental group practice 
there can be no assurance that our affiliated dental group practices will be able to negotiate satisfactory third party payor arrangements 
insufficient adjusted gross revenue under capitated contracts or other agreements with third party payors or termination of capitated contracts or other insurance programs by third party payors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we operate in a highly regulated environment the dental industry and dental practices are highly regulated at the state and federal levels  as described in the business government regulation section 
at the state level  many of these laws and regulations vary 
table of contents widely by state 
in addition  these laws and regulations are enforced by federal and state regulatory authorities with broad discretion and our agreements may be subject to review by these authorities from time to time 
for example  regulatory authorities in some states in which we operate have obtained a copy of our service agreement for review in the past  and the north carolina state board of dental examiners has recently undertaken an informal review of our service agreement with our north carolina affiliated dental group practice pursuant to a new rule regarding management arrangements adopted by that board in we do not  and do not intend to  control the practice of dentistry by the affiliated dental group practices or their compliance with the regulatory requirements directly applicable to dentists or the practice of dentistry 
however  there can be no assurance that any review of our business relationships  including our relationship with affiliated dental group practices  by courts or other regulatory authorities  will not result in determinations that could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
similarly  there can be no assurance that the laws and regulatory environment will not change to restrict or limit the enforceability of our service agreements 
the laws and regulations of some states in which we currently operate or may seek to expand may require us to change our contractual relationships with dental group practices in a manner that may restrict our operations in those states or may prevent us from affiliating with dental group practices or providing comprehensive business services to dental group practices in those states 
to the extent that contracts between third party payors and any affiliated dental group practice or us  including self insured plans  on a capitated or other basis which causes such affiliated dental group practices or us to assume a portion of the financial risk of providing dental care  we or such affiliated dental group practice may become subject to state insurance laws  in which case our affiliated dental group practice may be required to change the method of payment from third party payors or seek appropriate licensure 
any regulation of us or our affiliated dental group practices under insurance laws could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future affiliations may not be successfully integrated or completed on acceptable terms our strategy includes expansion through affiliations with dental group practices in new and existing markets and the expansion of such affiliated practices 
affiliations involve numerous risks  including failure to retain key personnel and contracts of the affiliated dental group practices and the inability to work successfully with us as a business partner 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete additional affiliations on acceptable terms and conditions 
or that we will be able to serve successfully as a business partner to additional dental group practices  and this could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we may not realize the expected value of our intangible assets a significant portion of our total assets is represented by intangible assets  with the amount expected to increase in connection with future affiliations and acquisitions 
in addition  amortization expense associated with the definite lived intangible assets will increase in the future as a result of definite lived intangibles recorded in connection with affiliations and acquisitions 
in the event of any sale or liquidation of us or a portion of our assets  there can be no assurance that the value of our intangible assets will be realized 
management performs an impairment test on definite lived intangibles when facts and circumstances exist which would suggest that the definite lived intangible assets may be impaired  such as loss of key personnel  change in legal factors or competition 
if impairment were determined  we would make the appropriate adjustment to the intangible asset to reduce the asset s carrying value to fair value 
any future determination requiring the write off of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not realize the expected value of our goodwill a portion of our total assets is represented by goodwill  the amount of which could increase in connection with future acquisitions 
in the event of any sale or liquidation of us or a portion of our assets  there can be no assurance that the value of our goodwill would be realized 
in addition  management performs an impairment test on goodwill on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely 
table of contents than not that an impairment loss has been incurred 
if impairment were determined  we would make the appropriate adjustment to goodwill to reduce the asset s carrying value to fair value 
any future determination requiring the write off of a significant portion of goodwill could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our operating results may be adversely affected by professional liability claims against our affiliated dental group practices our affiliated dental group practices could be exposed to the risk of professional liability claims 
it is possible that such claims could be asserted against us as well as the affiliated dental group practices 
such claims  if successful  could result in substantial damages that could exceed the limits of any applicable insurance coverage 
we are named as an insured party under the professional liability insurance policy covering our affiliated dental group practices 
in addition  we require each affiliated dental group practice to indemnify us for actions or omissions related to the delivery of dental care by such affiliated dental group practice 
however  a successful professional liability claim against an affiliated dental group practice or us could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to interest rate risk 
with regard to our revolving credit facility  we are also exposed to variable rate interest for the banks applicable margins  ranging from to based upon our debt coverage ratio 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair value but do not impact earnings or cash flow 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flow 
we do not believe a one percentage point change in interest rates would have a material impact on the fair market value of our fixed rate debt 
the pre tax earnings and cash flow impact for one year based upon the amounts outstanding at december  under our variable rate revolving credit facility for each one percentage point change in interest rates would be approximately  per annum 
we do not presently undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to interest rate risk and we are not party to any interest rate risk management transactions
