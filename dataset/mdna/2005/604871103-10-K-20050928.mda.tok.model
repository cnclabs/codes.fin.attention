fiscal years ended june  and net sales 
net sales of the company s medical devices and laboratory and scientific products increased  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this difference in net sales is due to an increase in sales of medical devices of  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this difference in net sales is also due to an increase in laboratory and scientific product sales of  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase in sales of medical devices is due to an increase in sales of therapeutic medical devices of  and an increase of  in sales of diagnostic medical devices  both due to increased customer demand for several diagnostic and therapeutic medical products 
the increase in sales of diagnostic medical devices was not attributable to a single customer  distributor or any other specific factor 
the increase in sales of therapeutic medical devices was mostly attributable to an increase in sales to byron medical of the lysonix device  the neuroaspirator device sold to aesculap and an increase in sales of the sonoblate  due to sales of the device in europe 
sales are not recorded as revenue until the total earnings process is complete 
the increase in sales of laboratory and scientific products is due to an increase in labcaire sales of  an increase in sales of ultrasonic laboratory products of  an increase in wet scrubber sales of  and an increase in ductless fume enclosure and related product sales of  the increase in labcaire sales is partially due to the strengthening of the english pound of approximately  and an increase in sales of the guardian endoscopic cleaning product of approximately  the increase in laboratory and scientific ultrasonic sales is due to an increase in customer demand for the ultrasonic sonicator product and wet scrubber product
