sarbanes oxley and related compliance the sarbanes oxley act of  which became law in july requires changes in certain of the company s corporate governance practices 
in addition  related rules have been made by the securities and exchange commission and nasdaq 
these new rules and regulations will increase the company s legal and financial compliance costs  and make some activities more difficult  time consuming and or costly 
these new rules and regulations are expected to make it more expensive to obtain director and officer liability insurance

additional costs related to compliance with the new requirements of sarbanes oxley rule section are expected to continue in future fiscal years 
the company s initiatives to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act and related regulations regarding management s required assessment of its internal control over financial reporting and the independent auditors attestation of that assessment has required  and continues to require  the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources

inflation and economic trends although inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations  the health care industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures as are rising supply costs that tend to escalate as vendors pass on the rising costs through price increases 
some of our freestanding owned  leased and managed inpatient behavioral health care facilities we operate are experiencing the effects of the tight labor market  including a shortage of nurses  which has caused and may continue to cause an increase in our salaries  wages and benefits expense in excess of the inflation rate 
although we cannot predict our ability to cover future cost increases  management believes that through adherence to cost containment policies  labor management and reasonable price increases  the effects of inflation on future operating margins should be manageable 
our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing health care to medicare and medicaid patients is limited due to various federal  state and local laws that have been enacted which  in certain cases  limit our ability to increase prices 
in addition  as a result of increasing regulatory and competitive pressures and a continuing industry wide shift of patients into managed care plans  our ability to maintain margins through price increases to non medicare patients is limited 
the behavioral health care industry is typically not directly impacted by periods of recession  erosions of consumer confidence or other general economic trends as most health care services are not considered a component of discretionary spending 
however  our inpatient facilities may be indirectly negatively impacted to the extent such economic conditions result in decreased reimbursements by federal or state governments or managed care payers 
we are not aware of any economic trends that would prevent us from being able to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants and to meet all required obligations and commitments in the near future 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion should be read in conjunction with note significant accounting policies and estimates in notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein which describes in more detail the company s significant accounting policies and estimates 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgements and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods 
the company s senior management and independent auditor have discussed the critical accounting estimates with the company s audit committee 
the company continually evaluates its accounting policies and the estimates it uses to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
in general  the estimates are based on historical experience  on 
table of contents 
index to financial statements information from third party professionals and on various other sources and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate  or the use of different estimating methods that could have been selected  could have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
the following presents information about the company s most critical accounting estimates 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
allowances are based on the likelihood of recoverability of accounts receivable considering such factors as past experience and taking into account current collection trends that are expected to continue 
factors taken into consideration in estimating the allowance are amounts past due  in dispute  or a client which the company believes might be having financial difficulties 
if economic  industry  or specific customer business trends worsen beyond earlier estimates  the company increases the allowances for doubtful accounts by recording additional expense 
legal fees expended in the pursuit of the outstanding amounts are considered recovered prior to the reversal of any previously written off bad debt 
the primary collection risk with regard to patient receivables associated with the company s behavioral health hospitals lies with uninsured patient accounts or patient accounts whereby the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement  but the portion of the amount that is the patient s responsibility primarily deductibles and co payments remains outstanding 
the company estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts primarily based upon the age of the patients accounts receivable  the patients economic ability to pay and the effectiveness of historical collection efforts 
the company continually monitors its accounts receivable balances and utilizes cash collection data to support its estimates of the provision for doubtful accounts 
significant changes in payor mix or business office operations could have a significant impact on the company s results of operations and cash flows 
allowance for contractual discounts with regard to the company s behavioral health hospitals  the medicare and medicaid regulations are complex and various managed care contracts may include multiple reimbursement mechanisms for different types of services provided and cost settlement provisions requiring complex calculations and assumptions subject to interpretation 
the company estimates the allowance for contractual discounts on a payor specific basis given its interpretation of the applicable regulations or contract terms 
the services authorized and provided and related reimbursements are often subject to interpretation that could result in payments that differ from the company s estimates in the near term 
additionally  updated regulations and contract renegotiations occur frequently necessitating continual review and assessment of the estimation process by management 
contractual discounts are reported as deductions from patient service revenue at the time the service is rendered 
medical claims medical claims payable represent the liability for healthcare claims reported but not yet paid and claims incurred but not yet reported ibnr related to the company s managed behavioral healthcare business 
the ibnr portion of medical claims payable is estimated based upon authorized healthcare services  past claims payment experience for member groups  enrollment data  utilization statistics and other factors using both accounting and actuarial methodologies 
although variability is inherent in such estimates  management believes the recorded liability for medical claims payable is adequate 
medical claim payable balances are monitored and reviewed monthly and actuarially certified  by a third party actuarial firm  on an annual basis 
changes in assumptions for care costs caused by changes in actual or expected experience could cause these estimates to change significantly 
reserves for these liabilities at august  and were million and million  respectively 
a increase in the assumed utilization of healthcare services would reduce net income by million after tax on an annualized basis 
this charge would impact the company s eap services group

index to financial statements goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired  net of liabilities assumed 
intangibles consist of the separately identifiable intangibles  such as contract valuations  non competes and trade names 
at august  goodwill and intangible assets represented of total assets 
contract valuations represent the fair value of management contracts and service contracts purchased and are being amortized using the straight line method over seven years 
other intangibles are being amortized over their expected useful lives 
per the provisions of sfas no 
 the company performs an annual goodwill impairment review  for each business service group as defined in note goodwill and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements  in the third quarter of each fiscal year or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
indicators the company consider important which could trigger an impairment review include  without limitation  i significant under performance or loss of key contracts acquired in an acquisition relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  ii significant changes in the manner or use of the acquired assets or the strategy of the company s overall the manner or use of the acquired assets or the strategy of the company s overall business  iii significant negative industry or economic trends  iv increased competitive pressures  v a significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period  and vi regulatory changes 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and intangibles  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimating methods and assumptions in these valuation techniques resulting in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and or goodwill  or alternatively an acceleration in amortization expense may result 
an impairment charge would reduce operating income in the period it was determined that the charge was needed 
as a result of the may  impairment testing  no impairment adjustments were deemed necessary 
sfas discontinued the amortization of goodwill and generally requires that goodwill impairment be tested annually using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment 
the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
however  intangible assets with indefinite lives are to be tested for impairment using a one step process that compares the fair value to the carrying amount of the asset 
because of the significance of the identified intangible assets and goodwill to the company s consolidated balance sheet  annual or interim impairment analyses are important 
changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or changes in market conditions or other external factors  could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company elected to conduct the annual impairment testing during its fiscal year third quarter 
as a result of the may  impairment testing  no impairment adjustments were deemed necessary 
reserves for employee health and workers compensation benefits these reserves represent accruals for estimated claims incurred  but unpaid or not reported 
the accruals are based on a number of factors including historical experience  industry trends and recent claims history and are subject to ongoing revision as conditions might change and as new data may be presented 
in estimating the liability for claims  the company obtains an estimate from a third party actuarial firm  which calculates an estimate using historical experiences and estimates of claim costs as well as numerous assumptions regarding factors relevant to the derivation of an estimate of future claim costs 
reserves for employee health benefits at august  and were  and  respectively 
the reserve was higher at august  due to the increase in the company s employee base 
reserves for workers compensation at august  and were  and  respectively 
the increase in the reserve is primarily due to the increase in the company s employee base 
reserve estimates are expected values of the amounts required to pay claims reported or incurred through august  and includes a reasonable additional reserve to account for a possible adverse deviation from the expected values estimated 
self insurance reserves this reserve represents an accrual for certain general and professional liability claims filed and for claims incurred  but not reported 
estimates of the aggregate or portions of claims pursuant to the company s self insurance retentions  and liability for uninsured claims incurred are determined by using actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and historical experience
