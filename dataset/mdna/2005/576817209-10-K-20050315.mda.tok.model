the discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those discussed in risk factors in this annual report 
the historical results of operations are not necessarily indicative of future results 
executive overview we provide comprehensive  integrated disease management services and related products that offer cost saving solutions for many of the most costly medical conditions and chronic diseases  including diabetes  cardiovascular diseases  respiratory disorders  obstetrical conditions  cancer  obesity  depression  chronic pain and hepatitis c 
we seek to improve patient outcomes and lower healthcare costs through a broad range of disease management programs and direct clinical services 
we emphasize a multidisciplinary approach to care that involves our clinicians working with physicians to oversee the adherence to treatment plans 
we focus on the management of patients between visits to their physician  the improvement of the patient s compliance with the physician s care plan and the avoidance of controllable and costly events  such as emergency room visits and hospital admissions 
to serve this critical aspect of patient care  we have invested heavily in disease management information technology  care center infrastructure and a national network of skilled multidisciplinary clinicians 
we provide services to self insured employers  private and government sponsored health plans  pharmaceutical companies and patients 
our employer clients are primarily fortune companies that self insure the medical benefits provided to their employees  dependents and retirees 
our health plan customers are regional and national health plans  as well as government sponsored health plans  such as state medicaid programs 
we have two reportable business segments health enhancement and women s and children s health 
health enhancement 
at december   our health enhancement segment was comprised of our disease management business  our foreign diabetes business and facet technologies  llc facet  our diabetes product design  development  assembly and distribution operation 
the disease management component of our health enhancement segment currently offers disease management services to employers and health plans for diabetes  cardiovascular disease  respiratory disorders  cancer  obesity  depression  and chronic pain 
we began our disease management business in  focusing solely on respiratory disease management 
in  we added diabetes disease management through an acquisition in which we acquired our former pharmacy and supplies business  as well as facet 
in  we developed programs for cardiac  depression and chronic pain disease management and expanded into cancer disease management with the acquisition of quality oncology  inc qo 
in  we launched an initiative to offer disease management services through pharmaceutical corporations in support of complex drug therapies and began to offer disease management services for hepatitis c 
in  we added obesity to our disease management programs 
our disease management programs seek to reduce medical costs and improve patient care for the chronically ill as well as those who are at the highest risk for significant and costly episodes of illness 
we use our proprietary technology platform  which we refer to as trax tm  to identify patients with the potential for high cost events and to proactively manage the care of the patients 
table of contents identified 
we help these individuals take more responsibility for their disease and avoid expensive medical events 
cost savings generally are realized through a reduction in emergency room visits and admissions to the hospital and shorter hospital stays 
our programs  which were developed in accordance with national clinical standards  are designed to increase patient compliance with the physician s plan of care 
effective october   we purchased certain assets of options unlimited comprehensive rehabilitative services  inc  now matria case management  a company specializing in case management for health plans  third party administrators and employers 
we have integrated this company s case management services with our existing disease management services and are offering these services to employers and health plans 
the disease management programs serve patients in the united states through our facilities in atlanta  georgia  mclean  virginia  sunrise  florida  el sequndo  california  houston  texas  and huntington  new york 
our foreign diabetes division provides diabetes products and supplies and certain value added services directly to patients in germany through its main facilities in neum nster and dresden  germany and depots maintained in physician offices and clinics 
most revenues are received directly from the german national healthcare system 
our health enhancement segment also includes facet  a leading designer  developer  assembler and distributor of products for the diabetes market  which we acquired in facet has to of the world market share in each of the three major product lines used by patients with diabetes to obtain blood samples for testing blood glucose levels standard lancets  lancing devices and safety lancets 
facet operates from facilities in marietta  georgia  mcdonough  georgia  and northhampton  england 
its products are shipped primarily to north and south america  europe and asia 
on june   we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets  excluding trade and certain other receivables  of our domestic direct to consumer pharmacy and supplies business 
as part of the transaction  the company and the buyer entered into a strategic relationship whereby the buyer will provide diabetes and respiratory supplies to our disease management customers 
as part of the sale  the buyer had the option to buy matria labs  inc  a direct to consumer laboratory business  for the purchase option expired  unexercised  in november the company had previously made the decision to exit the lab business in the event buyer did not exercise the purchase option 
as a result of the sale of the domestic pharmacy and supplies business and the discontinuance of the lab business  the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of these divisions as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
women s and children s health 
our women s and children s health segment offers a wide range of clinical and disease management services designed to assist physicians and payors in the cost effective management of maternity patients 
the segment manages patients with gestational diabetes  hypertension  hyperemesis  and anticoagulation disorders  as well as patients experiencing or at risk for preterm labor 
in addition  this segment recently launched a strategic initiative to provide services for children through neonatal intensive care case management 
in connection with this initiative  in  we changed the name of our women s health segment to women s and children s health 
our women s and children s health segment is headquartered in marietta  georgia and has sites of service throughout the united states  seven of which are monitoring centers 
all sites are fully accredited as home care organizations by the joint commission on accreditation of health care organizations 
in addition  the segment has two after hours centers 
most revenues are received directly from the patient s health plan 

table of contents industry factors total healthcare spending in the united states is expected to exceed trillion in  with predictions that healthcare spending will increase to trillion in according to the centers for disease control  a majority of that spending is attributed to the more than million americans suffering from chronic diseases 
in particular  patients with chronic conditions account for of all home healthcare visits  of all prescriptions  of all in patient hospital stays and of all physician visits 
moreover  healthcare spending to treat chronic diseases is rapidly rising due to noncompliant patients  uninformed patients who select expensive drug therapies  lack of coordinated systems and protocols to track and follow up with high acuity patients and the inability of medical professionals to fully address the day to day challenges faced by their patient populations 
all of these trends are causing healthcare industry participants to focus on solutions that lower costs through improved patient health and outcomes 
employers are especially affected by these trends 
in addition to double digit increases in direct healthcare costs  employers are experiencing an increase in indirect costs associated with absenteeism and other lost employee productivity 
the national academy on aging has found that chronic diseases are now recognized as a major source of lost productivity  estimating that the total dollar loss from chronic conditions ranges from billion to billion annually 
employers are seeking solutions to the impact healthcare is having on their profit margins and the additional financial burden being placed on their employees through increased premiums  co pays  coinsurance and deductibles 
employers are more proactive in their management of healthcare costs and increasingly view disease management as a meaningful and effective tool to address their healthcare problems 
the medicare program has also been significantly affected by the rising costs of healthcare due to the general aging of the population and the increased prevalence of chronic and high cost conditions among the elderly 
studies have shown that a relatively small number of beneficiaries with certain chronic illnesses asthma  diabetes  congestive heart failure and related cardiac conditions  hypertension  coronary artery disease  cardiovascular and cerebrovascular conditions  and chronic lung disease account for a disproportionate share of medicare fee for service expenditures 
patients with these conditions typically receive fragmented care from providers at multiple sites and require repeated hospitalization 
pursuant to recent medicare reform legislation  disease management demonstration programs will be established in ten regions of the country to test whether providing coordinated care services to medicare fee for service beneficiaries with complex chronic conditions can yield better clinical outcomes without increasing program costs 
in addition  a number of states are pursuing disease management pilots in their medicaid programs 
last year  the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  issued a release urging states to adopt disease management programs and announcing the availability of federal matching funding 
business strategy our goal is to further expand our position as a leading provider of disease management services 
we seek to achieve this goal by pursuing the following strategies capitalize on our position as an industry leader in the disease management market 
we believe our extensive experience  established infrastructure and list of existing customers provide us a significant competitive advantage as we seek to capitalize on the growing market for disease management 
we have more than years of experience in providing disease management and related services 
our established infrastructure includes our proprietary trax tm technology platform  care center operations located throughout the united states  supply distribution channels and a national network of skilled multi disciplinary clinicians 
leverage our trax tm technology 
we will continue to make significant investments in trax tm in order to better identify patients for intervention and improve treatment plans for these identified patients 
a 
table of contents major challenge of disease management programs is to link the design and monitoring of treatment plans with the actual clinical services and fulfillment of drugs and related supplies 
we believe that our trax tm technology platform is uniquely capable of addressing this issue and coordinating both treatment objectives and treatment activities 
further penetrate all key segments of the growing disease management market 
we intend to expand our customer base within the employer  health plan  state and federal governments  and pharmaceutical markets 
employers 
we have identified this sector as a prime customer target as employers seek to improve employee productivity by reducing absenteeism and other forms of lost productivity 
regional and national health plans 
although health plans have been in the medical management business for several years  they increasingly are seeking disease management as an opportunity to minimize medical cost inflation 
medicaid 
in august  we entered into an agreement with pfizer inc s health solutions group to provide disease management services to state medicaid programs under contract with pfizer 
we believe this alliance represents a significant market opportunity 
pharmaceutical companies 
we implemented a contract with schering plough corp 
to provide disease management services for patients infected with the hepatitis c virus 
the program helps patients complete their individualized peg intron therapy regimen  providing their best chance for achieving sustained viral response 
continue to expand our service offering 
we believe that the ability to offer customers an integrated health enhancement solution of services across multiple chronic medical conditions is an increasingly important competitive requirement 
we are continuously seeking to expand our product and service offerings 
for example  we entered the cancer disease management field by acquiring quality oncology in  and in we developed our depression and low back pain management programs  and expanded our case management services through the acquisition of options unlimited 
in  we added obesity management to our disease management services 
cross selling within our company 
we believe there is a significant opportunity to expand our disease management business by cross selling other products and services to existing customers as they realize the cost savings and better patient outcomes that our programs provide 
while the magnitude of growth in new accounts provides us with challenges  we have an established framework for assisting employers and health plans in managing and integrating their disease management programs 
we have expansion capacity in our care centers and have continued the rapid development of our trax tm technology platform and capabilities for the disease management processes and related connectivity and integration 
we do not foresee any abnormal pricing pressure relative to our disease management programs over the next year 
medical statistics indicate that one in eight births is preterm  with that number on the rise 
preterm delivery is the leading cause of neonatal mortality and birth related morbidity and results in significantly higher cost than full term pregnancies 
our women s and children s health segment s services have proven effective in extending pregnancy and reducing costs 
however  the reimbursement rates have been decreasing for certain services  and patient access to services that manage high risk pregnancies has been reduced 
we have million covered lives under all our contracts as of december  compared with million and million as of december  and  respectively

revenues from this segment are recognized as the related services are rendered and are net of contractual allowances and related discounts 
our health enhancement segment provides services through its patient service centers  provides supplies to patients  and designs  develops  assembles  packages and distributes diabetes products 
revenues for services are recognized when services are provided  and revenues from product sales are recognized when products are shipped 
revenues from this segment are recorded net of contractual allowances and other discounts 
our clinical services and our foreign supply businesses are reimbursed on a fee for service or per item basis 
other aspects of disease management  however  are paid for primarily on the basis of i monthly fees for each employee or member enrolled in a health plan  ii each member identified with a particular chronic disease or condition under contract  iii each member enrolled in our program or iv a fixed rate per case 
billings for certain services occur in advance of services being performed 
such amounts are recorded as unearned revenues in the balance sheet  and revenues are recognized as services are performed 
some of the contracts for these services provide that a portion of our fees is at risk subject to our performance against financial cost savings and clinical criteria 
thus  a portion of our revenues are accrued in the period the services are provided and adjusted in future periods when final settlement is determined 
these estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as information related to performance levels and associated fees become available 
these reviews and adjustments have not resulted in a material reduction in any recent period of revenue previously reported 
in  of our revenues recognized were at risk under these arrangements 
a significant portion of our revenues is billed to third party reimbursement sources 
accordingly  the ultimate collectibility of a substantial portion of our trade accounts receivable is susceptible to changes in third party reimbursement policies 
in addition  the collectibility of all of our accounts receivable varies based on 
table of contents payor mix  general economic conditions and other factors 
a provision for doubtful accounts is made for revenues estimated to be uncollectible and is adjusted periodically based upon our evaluation of current industry conditions  historical collection experience  recoveries of amounts previously provided  industry reimbursement trends  audit activity and other relevant factors which  in the opinion of management  deserve recognition in estimating the allowance for uncollectible accounts 
the evaluation is performed at each reporting period for each operating unit with an overall assessment at the consolidated level 
the evaluation of the monthly estimates of revenues estimated to be uncollectible has not resulted in material adjustments in any recent period  however  special charges have resulted from certain specific circumstances affecting collectibility 
while estimates and judgments are involved and factors impacting collectibility may change  management believes adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from final determination of amounts to be collected 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
as of december   we reported goodwill and identifiable intangible assets at carrying amounts of million and million  respectively 
the total of million represents approximately of total assets as of december  our identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives 
our goodwill is no longer amortized to expense 
we review goodwill and identifiable intangibles for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in testing for impairment  we calculate the fair value of the reporting units to which the goodwill and identifiable intangibles relate based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
based on the evaluation  management concluded that no impairment of recorded goodwill and intangibles exists at december  the approach utilized is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of future revenues and costs  appropriate discount rates and other variables 
we base our estimates on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
therefore  future impairments could result if actual results differ from those estimates 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach 
deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
additionally  the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date 
the income tax benefit was million for compared to an income tax expense of million for reflected in and were various non deductible permanent differences between tax and financial reporting 
as of december   our remaining net operating losses of million  the tax effect of which is reflected on the balance sheet in the deferred tax asset  will be available to offset future taxable income liabilities 
based on projections of taxable income in and future years  management believes that it is more likely than not that we will fully realize the value of the recorded deferred income tax assets 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see the notes to consolidated financial statements which contain additional accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates  and this disclosure  with the audit committee of our board of directors 

table of contents recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which and entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
this statement requires a public entity to measure the costs of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
this statement applies to all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after that date 
compensation cost will be recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards  for which the requisite service has not been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under sfas no 
for either recognition or pro forma disclosures 
the statement is effective for the first interim period or annual period that begins after june  we have concluded that sfas r will have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations 
if we elect the retrospective method  we expect that the impact of expensing existing stock options  as well as the impact of any anticipated stock option grants and restricted stock awards  to be approximately to per share in if we elect the prospective method  we expect that the impact of expensing stock options  as well as the impact of any anticipated stock option grants and restricted stock awards  to be approximately to per share in we do not expect the impact of sfas r to have a material impact on our cash flow or liquidity 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for assumptions used calculating the fair value of employee stock options 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs sfas 
this statement clarifies the accounting for the abnormal amount of idle facilities expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material 
this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period expense 
in addition  the statement requires that allocation of fixed overhead to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred after december  we are currently assessing the impact of sfas on our financial condition and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas 
sfas amends the guidance in apb opinion no 
to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary assets of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
sfas specifies that a nonmonetary asset has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the provisions of this statement shall be effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  and shall be applied prospectively 
we do not expect the impact of sfas on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows to be material 
in september  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share eitf where contingently convertible instruments should be included in diluted earnings per share  if dilutive  regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met 
this required us to include in the diluted earnings per share calculation the effect of our issuance of convertible senior subordinated notes in eitf had a and dilutive effect on our third and fourth quarters of  respectively  but no effect in our annual calculation since the inclusion of the shares would have been antidilutive 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our operations outside the united states  with sales denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily in germany  generated approximately of total revenues in the year ended december  in the normal course of business  these operations are exposed to fluctuations in currency values 
in addition  we have certain receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the euro 
we do not consider the impact of currency fluctuations to represent a significant risk and have chosen not to hedge our foreign currency exposure 
based on our results for and balances as of december   a hypothetical change in the currency exchange rates would impact annual pre tax earnings by approximately million
