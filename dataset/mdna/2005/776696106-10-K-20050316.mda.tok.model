item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
in august  we changed our fiscal year end from october to december effective as of january   with the two months ended december  being the transition period 
overview we are a diversified industrial company that designs  manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls  scientific and industrial imaging products and software  industrial technology products  instrumentation products and services and radio frequency identification and satellite based communication technologies and related services 
we market these products and services to selected segments of a broad range of markets including radio frequency rf applications  water and wastewater  oil and gas  research  power generation  general industry and other niche markets 
we pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses 
our acquisitions have represented both bolt ons and new strategic platforms 
we strive for high cash and earnings returns from our acquisition investments 
on june   we purchased the power generation business of r d tech which was combined with our existing zetec business in the area of non destructive evaluation 
on december   we acquired transcore a provider of technologies and related services in areas such as radio frequency identification rfid  satellite based communication  mobile asset tracking  security applications and comprehensive toll system and processing services 
in connection with this acquisition we replaced our existing million credit agreement  completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock  and entered into an amended and restated billion credit agreement 
an underwriters overallotment of  shares of our common stock was subsequently exercised and closed on december  during the year ended december   our results of operations benefited from the ntgh acquisition made on december  and the partial year activities of the power generation business of r d tech purchased on june  during the transition period ended december   we began reporting our operations under a new segment structure 
this structure includes four market focused groups intended to capture value creating opportunities around common customers  market orientation  sales channels  technologies and common cost opportunities 
following the segment realignment  we started a number of restructuring activities that were completed in the first quarter of during  we completed the integration of our acton research and integrated design business units  the integration of ai qualitek into the uson business unit  the integration of production operations of our redlake business unit into other imaging segment facilities and the relocation of struers manufacturing  engineering and administrative support into a new facility 
in we also opened new production facilities in mexico and china 
during we moved the us production operations of the amot controls business unit to other facilities and completed a restructuring of the compressor controls business unit to adjust to lower levels of oao gazprom business 
all of these actions were planned to lower costs and enhance profit margins 
application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap 
a discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report 
gaap offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results  such as determining inventory cost  depreciating long lived assets  recognizing revenues and issuing stock options to employees 
we have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements  except for the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets as discussed below 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the use of estimates  assumptions  judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures 
the development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management 
our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the sec 
although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable  others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available 
if an accounting estimate changes  its effects are accounted for prospectively 
our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility  inventory utilization  future warranty obligations  revenue recognition percent of completion  income taxes and goodwill and indefinite lived asset analyses 
these issues  except for income taxes  which are not allocated to our business segments  affect each of our business segments 
these issues are evaluated primarily using a combination of historical experience  current conditions and relatively short term forecasting 
accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products  including in certain cases credits for returned products 
accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms  whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences  what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that current and near term forecast economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers 
the returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits 
at december   our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  sales returns and sales credits was million  or of total gross accounts receivable 
this percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables and is not significantly different as a percent of sales as compared to the december  level 
we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage  which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities 
when we use historical usage  this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage 
business trends can change rapidly and these events can affect the evaluation of inventory balances 
at december   inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were million  or of gross first in  first out inventory cost 
this percentage has decreased from in the fiscal year ended december  we expect this percentage to continue to decrease over time 
most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale  typically months 
future warranty obligations are evaluated using  among other factors  historical cost experience  product evolution and customer feedback 
at december   the reserve for future warranty obligations was million 
our expense for warranty obligations was less than of net sales for each of the twelve month periods ended december   december   and october revenues related to the use of the percentage of completion method of accounting are dependent on a comparison of total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project 
during the twelve month period ended december   we recognized revenue of approximately million using this method  primarily for major turn key  longer term energy projects 
no material amount of revenue was recognized using this method during the two month period ended december  approximately million and million of revenue was recognized using this method during the twelve months ended december  and october   respectively 
at december  approximately million of revenue related to unfinished percentage of completion contracts had yet to be recognized 
contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods 
we expect a significant increase in revenue related to the use of percentage of completion accounting in as transcore has several longer term projects related to toll and traffic systems that require use of this method 
income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and how and when cash is repatriated to the united states  combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy 
additionally  taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items  and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward 
accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws  rules and regulations  each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner 
during  our effective income tax rate was  which included a million additional r d credit  as compared to for our rate was abnormally low due to the marginal rate impact in the fourth quarter of fiscal of certain expenses related to the ntgh acquisition and related financing and the demonstrated ability to avoid repatriation of certain foreign sourced earnings 
we expect our tax rate in to increase to approximately due primarily to transcore s higher effective rate 
we adopted sfas no 
effective november  the beginning of our fiscal year ended october  the evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets under sfas requires valuations of each applicable underlying business 
these valuations can be significantly affected by estimates of future performance and discount rates over a relatively long period of time  market price valuation multiples and marketplace transactions in related markets 
these estimates will likely change over time 
some of our businesses operate in somewhat cyclical industries and the valuation of these businesses can be expected to fluctuate as a result of this cyclicality 
the transitional business valuation reviews required by sfas indicated a reduction of the carrying value of goodwill for three business units redlake  petrotech and dynamco 
this goodwill reduction was reported as a change in accounting principle retroactive to the beginning of our fiscal year ended october  and resulted in a transitional charge to earnings of approximately million 
sfas requires goodwill to be evaluated annually 
if this annual review indicates further impairment of goodwill balances  that entire impairment will be recorded immediately and reported as a component of current operations 
our annual reviews undertaken during and did not indicate that any further impairment to the goodwill balances was necessary 
our acquisitions have generally included a large goodwill component and we expect this to continue with future acquisitions 
prior to adopting sfas  goodwill was amortized over periods not exceeding years 
with the adoption of this standard  goodwill is not amortized 
it is periodically reviewed for impairment as discussed above 
we are unable to conclude whether the likelihood of any impairment charge resulting from subsequent annual reviews is more likely in any business segment compared to another segment

includes results of transcore from december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  were million as compared to sales of million for the year ended december   an increase of 
this increase was the result of sales from acquired companies and strong internal growth 
our results included a full year of sales from the ntgh acquisition  six months of sales from the power generation business of r d tech and two weeks of sales from the transcore acquisition 
in our instrumentation segment  net sales for the year ended december  increased by million or over the year ended december  the increase was attributable to improved distribution  new product introductions  favorable market conditions  and changes in exchange rates 
net sales for our industrial technology segment increased by million or for the twelve months ended december  over the twelve months ended december  the increase primarily resulted from the ntgh acquisition  and also included stronger sales into industrial  energy  and commercial refrigeration end markets 
in our energy systems and controls segment  net sales for the twelve months ended december  increased by million or over the twelve months ended december  the increase was due to the partial year impact of the power generation business of r d tech acquired in as well as higher system and product sales of energy applications  substantially offset by lower sales to gazprom 
our scientific and industrial imaging segment reported an increase in net sales of million or for the twelve months ended december  over the twelve months ended december  the increase was attributable to the full year impact of ntgh acquired in our rf technology segment was established in the fourth quarter of with the acquisition of transcore on december  and includes two weeks of sales in our overall gross profit percentage was for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  instrumentation segment gross margins decreased to as compared to in the prior year 
the margins were impacted by increased sales of third party sourced products that carried a lower gross profit margin  but good operating profit margins 
as expected  industrial technology gross margins decreased  to as compared to in the prior year  because ntgh gross margins are lower than the segment average 
our energy systems and controls segment gross margins were in as compared to in this was due to a margin decrease in our turbomachinery controls business offset by an increase in margins in our non destructive testing business 
our scientific and industrial imaging segment gross margins were in as compared to in this increase is due to improved margins in our high performance digital imaging cameras and electron microscopes  much of which was achieved through the restructuring efforts undertaken in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased to of net sales for the year ended december  from of net sales for the year ended december  the decrease is due to leverage from higher sales levels and the reductions in restructuring expenses that were incurred in the prior year 
this was offset with increased expenses related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act 
interest expense increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   as a result of higher debt levels incurred due to the ntgh acquisition in december income taxes were of pretax earnings in compared to for our rate was low due to the marginal rate impact in the fourth quarter of fiscal of certain expenses related to the ntgh acquisition and related financing 
our rate also included an additional million credit related to a r d study completed during the year 
we expect our tax rate in to increase to approximately due primarily to transcore s higher effective rate 
at december   the functional currencies of our european subsidiaries were stronger against the us dollar compared to currency exchange rates at december  this strengthening resulted in an increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of million in the twelve month period ending december  approximately million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows 
operating earnings benefited from stronger non us currencies 
foreign exchange differences related to our other non us subsidiaries were immaterial to financial performance 
the following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended december  and dollar amounts in thousands 
change instrumentation   industrial technology   energy systems and controls   scientific and industrial imaging   rf technology  nm total   instrumentation segment net orders improved due to continued strength for oil and gas desulfurization applications and higher orders for our materials analysis equipment 
in addition  approximately of the increase was due to the stronger european and asian currencies against the dollar 
industrial technology segment net orders strengthened over all markets from the prior year and also benefited from the orders for neptune which were not included in the prior year 
energy systems and controls net orders rose due to strength in the non destructive testing markets as well as the inclusion of the orders of the power generation business of r d tech which is included for almost seven months of the current year 
in addition  there was continued strength in non gazprom oil and gas sectors  offset by significantly lower gazprom orders 
scientific and industrial imaging net orders increased from strong orders for electron microscopy products 
the following table summarizes sales order backlog information at december  and dollar amounts in thousands 
roper s policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months 
change instrumentation   industrial technology   energy systems and controls   scientific and industrial imaging   rf technology  total   the increase in backlog is due primarily to the inclusion of the transcore backlog of firm orders which can be shipped within twelve months 
year ended december  compared to year ended october  net sales for the twelve months ended december  were million as compared to sales of million for the twelve months ended october   an increase of 
a significant part of the increase was the full year impact of our fiscal acquisitions  zetec  ai qualitek and qimaging 
we had a significant decrease in sales to gazprom million or decline from the prior period as a result of the change in their procurement processes 
this significant decline was offset by sales increases in materials analysis equipment and consumables  imaging sales into electron microscopy markets  water wastewater projects and other oil and gas sector sales 
in our instrumentation segment  net sales for the twelve months ended december  increased by million or over the twelve months ended october  the increase was attributable to the full year impact of ai qualitek acquired in fiscal and strong results from our european based struers operation which was partially offset by continued depressed business conditions in telecommunications markets 
net sales for our industrial technology segment increased by million or for the twelve months ended december  over the twelve months ended october  the increase was the result of strength in our industrial pumps companies which experienced increased sales in the larger municipal water wastewater projects 
in our energy systems and controls segment  net sales for the twelve months ended december  increased by million or over the twelve months ended october  the increase was due to the full year impact of zetec acquired in fiscal  offset by the expected lower sales levels to gazprom 
we also had improved sales of our machinery vibration sensor equipment in the current twelve month period 
our scientific and industrial imaging segment reported an increase in net sales of million or for the twelve months ended december  over the twelve months ended october  the increase was attributable to both the full year impact of qimaging acquired in fiscal and the increased sales for electron microscopy products 
our overall gross profit percentage was for the twelve months ended december  as compared to for the twelve months ended october  instrumentation segment gross margins were roughly flat period over period at as compared to 
industrial technology gross margins decreased to due to an erosion in part of our industrial valves and controls business that was addressed by moving production to lower cost environments 
our energy systems and controls segment reported margins of in fiscal as compared to in fiscal a decrease was expected this year from the full year inclusion of zetec whose gross margins are lower than the segment average 
additionally there were lower margins from the significantly lower levels of gazprom sales in this segment in the current period 
our scientific and industrial imaging segment gross margins were in fiscal as compared to in fiscal as we experienced a rebound in motion imaging equipment sales and a higher percentage of the segment sales in higher margin product 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to of net sales for the twelve months ended december  from of net sales for the twelve months ended october   primarily from million of restructuring expenses of net sales incurred in the current fiscal year to reduce excess manufacturing capacity  move certain operations to lower cost locations and reduce fixed costs 
interest expense decreased million  or  for the twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended october   as a result of lower debt levels in the current period 
the company used its cash flows generated from operating activities to reduce debt levels prior to the ntgh transaction 
income taxes were of pretax earnings in fiscal compared to in fiscal the primary factors for the decrease were the marginal rate impact in the fourth quarter of fiscal of certain expenses related to the ntgh acquisition and related financing transactions and the demonstrated ability to avoid repatriation of certain foreign sourced earnings 
at december   the functional currencies of our european subsidiaries were stronger against the us dollar compared to currency exchange rates at both october  and december  this strengthening resulted in an increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of million in the two month period ending december  and of million in the twelve month period ending december  approximately million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows 
fiscal operating results also benefited from the stronger non us currencies 
the net benefits were approximately of operating earnings 
foreign exchange differences related to our other non us subsidiaries were immaterial to fiscal financial performance 
the following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended december  and october  dollar amounts in thousands 
change instrumentation   industrial technology   energy systems and controls   scientific and industrial imaging   total   instrumentation segment net orders improved due to the full year bookings of ai qualitek  continued strength for oil and gas desulfurization applications and higher orders for our materials analysis equipment 
industrial technology segment net orders strengthened over most markets after a soft fiscal energy systems and controls net orders rose on the strength of a full year of zetec orders and strength in non gazprom oil and gas sectors  offset by significantly lower gazprom orders 
scientific and industrial imaging net orders benefited from the full year of qimaging orders offset by the timing of orders for electron microscopy products sales increased in the period and weaker research market demand for high end digital cameras 
the following table summarizes sales order backlog information at december  and october  dollar amounts in thousands 
change instrumentation   industrial technology   energy systems and controls   scientific and industrial imaging   total   the increase in backlog was primarily due to the inclusion of the ntgh entities at december  the decline in the instrumentation backlog is the result of continued softness in our telecommunications business 
two months ended december  compared to two months ended december  net sales for the two month period ended december  were million as compared to million in the two month period ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to lower sales to gazprom and the absence of motion imaging sales in the scientific and industrial imaging segment  partially offset by the contributions from our fiscal acquisitions 
in our instrumentation segment  net sales decreased by as compared to the prior year period primarily as a result of surplus used equipment flooding the weak telecommunications capital equipment markets for our logitech unit and lower capital spending in the semi conductor market 
elsewhere softness in oil gas refinery capital spending offset the benefits of the ai qualitek acquisition 
gross margins moved from in the prior year period to in the current period largely from the adverse leverage at our logitech unit and semi conductor businesses 
sg a expenses as a percentage of sales were higher at due to lower sales volume explained above and higher medical insurance expenditures 
overall the segment reported operating profit margins of as compared to in the prior year period 
in our industrial technology segment  net sales were comparable to the same period in gross margins decreased to in the period from in the prior year  however  sg a expenses as a percentage of sales were lower at offsetting the reduction in gross margin allowing the operating profit margin to remain constant at 
the lower sg a expense level is primarily the result of headcount reductions 
net sales in our energy systems controls segment increased by during the two months ended december  as sales contributed by zetec and higher control systems sales to oil and gas customers more than offset the lower sales to gazprom 
gross margins decreased from to as a result of the adverse sales leverage from the deferred gazprom sales and the seasonal low sales at zetec with reduced power generation inspection activity during the peak heating season 
this adverse leverage also resulted in an increase in sg a expenses as a percentage of sales from in the prior year period to in the current year period 
as a result  operating losses increased from in the prior year period to 
management does not anticipate that the confluence of these events giving rise to such operating margins will recur in the future 
our scientific industrial imaging segment net sales decreased by due primarily to the absence of motion imaging product sales which was partially offset by net sales contributed by the contributions from the qimaging and definitive imaging acquisitions 
gross margins decreased from in to due to the increased manufacturing costs in the period for tem imaging equipment 
sg a expenses as a percentage of sales increased to in the period from in the prior year period as a result of additional costs associated with the development of the new motion imaging products and additional costs associated with foreign sales subsidiaries 
overall  the segment reported operating profits margins of as compared to with the bulk of the decline attributable to the repositioning of our motion imaging business 
corporate expenses decreased by million and reduced as a percentage of sales from to due primarily to reduced variable compensation costs 
interest expense held constant at million for the two month period ended december  compared to the two month period ended december   as lower effective interest rates offset increased borrowing levels 
other income was million in the two month period ended december  as compared to million in the equivalent prior year period from reduced realized foreign exchange gains 
income taxes were of pretax earnings in the current year period as compared to in the equivalent prior year period principally driven by improved expectations for our utilization of all available foreign income tax credits 
at december   the functional currencies of our european subsidiaries were stronger against the us dollar compared to currency exchange rates at october  and december  this strengthening resulted in a gain of million in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings for the two month period ended december  approximately million of the total adjustment related to goodwill and is not expected to directly affect our expected future cash flows 
operating results in the two month period also benefited from the weakening of the us dollar  primarily against the euro 
the difference between the operating results for these companies for the two month period ending december   translated into us dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during the two month period and these operating results translated into us dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during the comparable two month period in was not material 
if the impact of selling european sourced product in the us is also considered  the impact of currency movements was negligible 
net orders  booked for continuing operations  were million for the period  higher than the same period of net order intake of million 
this increase was due to the additional net orders booked of million from our fiscal acquisitions  which was somewhat offset by delays in blanket order releases and other industrial market softness for our industrial technology segment 
overall  our order backlog at december  increased by million as compared to december  this increase was due to new acquisitions having million in backlog at december   partially offset by softness in the industrial technology segment 
net orders booked for the two months ended december  order backlog as of december  instrumentation     industrial technology     energy systems controls     scientific industrial imaging    financial condition  liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million for the twelve months ended december   million for the twelve months ended december   and million for the twelve months ended october  results include a million write off of debt extinguishment costs related to the recapitalization of the company 
the increase in over reflected stronger earnings from operations due to the inclusion of ntgh in  strong internal growth  the non recurrence of debt extinguishment cash cost and low cash tax payments due to the utilization of certain domestic net operating losses for tax purposes 
cash flows used in investing activities during each of fiscal   and were primarily business acquisition costs 
cash flows from financing activities during each of these years were largely debt repayments and borrowings for acquisitions 
financing activities in also included amending and restating our previous million credit agreement with our current billion credit agreement to increase capacity  lower borrowing costs  and improve other terms and conditions 
net working capital current assets  excluding cash  less total current liabilities  excluding debt was million at december  compared to million at december  we acquired approximately million of net current assets through business acquisitions during total debt was million at december  of total capital compared to million at december  of total capital 
our increased debt at december  compared to december  was due to borrowings incurred at the end of the current year to fund the transcore acquisition and replace the previous credit facility 
our billion credit facility consists of a million term loan and a million revolving loan  both with five year maturities 
at december   our debt consisted of million in senior subordinated convertible notes due in  and the million term loan 
the company had million of outstanding letters of credit at december  million of the letters of credit were issued via the revolving loan  thereby reducing its remaining capacity to million 
we expect that our available borrowing capacity  combined with existing cash balances and cash flows expected to be generated from existing businesses  will be sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and finance additional acquisitions 
we also have several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in various foreign locations to support our non us businesses 
in total  these smaller facilities do not represent a significant source of credit for us 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facilities throughout the year ended december  capital expenditures of million  million and million were incurred during  and  respectively 
we expect capital expenditures in to be slightly higher due to the higher capital expenditure requirements of the newly acquired transcore business 
description of certain indebtedness senior secured credit facility concurrently with the closing of the transcore acquisition and the common stock and debt offerings in december  we entered into a billion senior secured credit facility 
this credit facility consists of a five year million term loan and a five year million revolving loan 
our credit facility requires us to prepay the term loan and  in certain cases  reduce the commitments under the revolving loan  upon the receipt of certain proceeds  including from certain asset sales  the incurrence of certain debt  and up to of our excess cash flows unless we meet a consolidated total leverage ratio test 
we are also required to make quarterly principal payments on the term loans 
the facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which  among other things  limit our ability to incur new debt  prepay subordinated debt  make certain investments and acquisitions  sell assets and grant liens  make restricted payments including the payment of dividends on our common stock and capital expenditures  or change our line of business 
we also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio 
senior subordinated convertible notes in december  we issued million of senior subordinated convertible notes at an original issue discount of  resulting in an effective yield of per year to maturity 
interest on the notes is payable semiannually  beginning july   until january  after that date  we will not pay cash interest on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash interest becomes payable 
instead  after january   interest will be recognized at the effective rate of and will represent accrual of original issue discount  excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable 
we will pay contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period commencing after january  if the average trading price of a note for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals or more of the sum of the issue price  accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest  if any  for such note 
the contingent cash interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 
the notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations  rank junior to our existing and future senior secured indebtedness and rank equally with our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness 
as originally issued  each  principal amount of the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder into shares of our common stock subject to adjustment  if i the sale price of our common stock reaches  or the trading price of the notes falls below  specified thresholds  ii if the notes are called for redemption or iii if specified corporate transactions have occurred 
upon conversion  we will have the right to deliver  in lieu of common stock  cash or a combination of cash and common stock 
on november   the company began a consent solicitation to amend the notes such that the company would pay the same conversion value upon conversion of the notes  but would change how the conversion value is paid 
in lieu of receiving exclusively shares of common stock or cash upon conversion  noteholders would receive cash up to the value of the accreted principal amount of the notes converted and  at the company s option  any remainder of the conversion value would be paid in cash or shares of common stock 
the consent solicitation was successfully completed on december  and the amended conversion provisions were adopted 
holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on january   january   january   january   and january   at stated prices plus accrued cash interest  if any  including contingent cash interest  if any 
we may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in common stock 
we may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes for cash at any time on or after january  at redemption prices equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest  if any  including contingent cash interest  if any  on such notes to the applicable redemption date 
contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments and contingencies the following table quantifies our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at december  dollars in thousands 
payments due in fiscal contractual cash obligations total thereafter long term debt      operating leases      total      amounts expiring in fiscal other commercial commitments total amount committed thereafter standby letters of credit and bank guarantees   at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our various credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and further acquisition activities 
although we maintain an active acquisition program  any further acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities  financial condition and results of operations 
we may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources 
we anticipate that our recently acquired businesses as well as our other businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities  and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt at a high rate 
however  the rate at which we can reduce our debt during and reduce the associated interest expense will be affected by  among other things  the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies 
none of these factors can be predicted with certainty

these assumptions could prove inaccurate 
although we believe that the estimates and projections reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable  our expectations may prove to be incorrect 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or projections contained in the forward looking statements include our ability to integrate the transcore acquisition businesses into our operations  any unforeseen liabilities associated with the transcore businesses or future acquisitions  limitations on our business imposed by our indebtedness  reductions in our business with gazprom  the success of our restructuring activities in reducing costs  unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates  difficulties associated with exports  risks and costs associated with our international sales and operations  difficulty making acquisitions and successfully integrating acquired businesses  increased directors and officers liability and other insurance costs  risk of rising interest rates  product liability and insurance risks  increased warranty exposure  future competition  the cyclical nature of our markets  reduction of business with large customers  risks associated with government contracts  changes in the supply of  or price for  parts and components  environmental compliance costs and liabilities  risks and costs associated with asbestos related litigation  potential write offs of our substantial intangible assets  our ability to successfully develop new products  failure to protect our technology  trade tariffs that may be applied due to the us government s delay in complying with certain wto directives  terrorist attacks  future health crises  and the factors discussed in exhibit to this annual report under the heading risk factors 
we believe these forward looking statements are reasonable

further  forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made  and we undertake no obligation to update publicly any of them in light of new information or future events 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings  and we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock 
at december   we had a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings 
our billion senior credit facility contains million variable rate term notes and a million variable rate revolver 
to reduce the financial risk of future rate increases  the company entered into fixed rate swap agreements  including a million agreement expiring january   and  subsequent to year end  a million agreement expiring march  our million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate 
at december   there was no material difference between prevailing market rates and the fixed rate on our debt instruments 
at december   roper s outstanding variable rate borrowings under the billion credit facility were million 
an increase in interest rates of would increase our annualized interest costs by million before accounting for the million fixed rate swap agreement which we entered into subsequent to year end 
several roper companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros  british pounds  danish krone or japanese yen 
sales by companies whose functional currency was not the us dollar were of our total sales and of these sales were by companies with a european functional currency 
the us dollar weakened against these european currencies during and was relatively stable compared to other currencies 
the difference between operating results for these companies translated into us dollars during and these operating results translated into us dollars during was not material 
if these currency exchange rates had been different throughout compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced  the impact on our expected net earnings would have been approximately million 
the changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar during compared to currency exchange rates at december  resulted in an increase in net assets of million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings  million of which was attributed to goodwill 
goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows 
the trading price of roper s common stock influences the valuation of stock option grants and the effects these grants have on pro forma earnings disclosed in our financial statements 
the stock prices also influence the computation of the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options to determine diluted earnings per share 
the stock price also affects our employees perceptions of various programs that involve our common stock 
we believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable
