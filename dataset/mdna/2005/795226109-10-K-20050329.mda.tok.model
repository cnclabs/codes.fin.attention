competition the company and the bank encounter competition in all phases of their business 
there are numerous financial institutions that have offices in the areas in which the company and bank compete in northwestern connecticut  western massachusetts and proximate areas of new york state 
all of the offices of the bank are located in the northwest corner of litchfield county  connecticut and south berkshire county  massachusetts 
the bank maintains six banking offices within these two counties and also attracts customers from nearby columbia county and dutchess county  new york 
the bank s market area within the four counties is served by commercial banks and savings banks 
the bank has a market share of deposits in such market 
banks compete on the basis of price  including rates paid on deposits and charged on borrowings  convenience and quality of service 
savings and loan associations are able to compete aggressively with commercial banks in the important area of consumer lending 
credit unions and small loan companies are each significant factors in the consumer market 
insurance companies  investment firms  credit and mortgage companies  brokerage firms cash management accounts  money market funds and retailers are all significant competitors for various types of business 
insurance companies  investment counseling firms and other businesses and individuals actively compete with the bank for personal and corporate trust services and investment counseling services 
many non bank competitors are not subject to the extensive regulation described below under legislation  regulation and supervision and in certain respects may have a competitive advantage over banks in providing certain services 
in marketing its services  the bank emphasizes its position as a hometown bank with personal service  flexibility and prompt responsiveness to the needs of its customers 
moreover  the bank competes for both deposits and loans by offering competitive rates and convenient business hours 
in addition to providing banking services to customers in its primary service areas  the bank is a member of the automatic teller machine networks and offers internet banking services  which allow the bank to deliver certain financial services to customers regardless of their proximity to the primary service area of the bank 
connecticut has enacted legislation which liberalized banking powers for thrift institutions thereby improving their competitive position with other banks 
in addition  the connecticut interstate banking act permits acquisitions and mergers of connecticut banks and bank holding companies of or with banks and bank holding companies in other states 
accordingly  it is possible for large super regional organizations to enter many new markets including the market served by the bank 
certain of these competitors  by virtue of their size and resources  may enjoy certain efficiencies and competitive advantages over the bank in the pricing  delivery  and marketing of their products and services 
it is possible that such legislative authority will increase the number or the size of financial institutions competing with the bank for deposits and loans in its market place  although it is impossible to predict the effect upon competition of such legislation 
legislation  regulation and supervision general virtually every aspect of the business of banking is subject to regulation including such matters as the amount of reserves that must be established against various deposits  the establishment of branches  mergers  non banking activities and other operations 
numerous laws and regulations also set forth special restrictions and procedural requirements with respect to the extension of credit  credit practices  the disclosure of credit terms and discrimination in credit transactions 
the descriptions of the statutory provisions and regulations applicable to banks set forth below do not purport to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the bank 
proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry are frequently introduced in congress  in the state legislatures and before the various bank regulatory agencies 
the likelihood and timing of any changes and the impact such changes might have on the bank s future business and earnings are difficult to determine 
federal reserve board regulation the company is a registered bank holding company under the bank holding company act of  as amended the bhca 
it is subject to the supervision and examination of the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve board and files with the federal reserve board the reports as required under the bhca 
the bhca generally requires prior approval by the federal reserve board of the acquisition by the company of substantially all of the assets or more than five percent of the voting stock of any bank 
the bhca also allows the federal reserve board to determine by order or by regulation what activities are so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident of banking  and thus  whether the company can engage in such activities 
the bhca prohibits the company and the bank from engaging in certain tie in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit  sale of property or furnishing of services 
federal legislation permits adequately capitalized bank holding companies to venture across state lines to offer banking services through bank subsidiaries to a wide geographic market 
it is possible for large super regional organizations to enter many new markets including the market served by the bank  although it is impossible to assess what impact this will have on the company or the bank 
the federal reserve act imposes certain restrictions on loans by the bank to the company and certain other activities  on investments  in their stock or securities  and on the taking by the bank of such stock or securities as collateral security for loans to any borrower 
under the bhca and the regulations of the federal reserve system promulgated thereunder regulation y  no corporation may become a bank holding company as defined therein  without prior approval of the federal reserve board 
the company received the approval to become a bank holding company on june  the company will also have to secure prior approval of the federal reserve board if it wishes to acquire voting shares of any other bank  if after such acquisition it would own or control more than five percent of the voting share of such bank 
the bhca imposes limitations upon the company as to the types of business in which it may engage 
regulation y requires bank holding companies to provide the federal reserve board with written notice before purchasing or redeeming equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption  when aggregated with the net consideration paid by the company for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding twelve months  is equal to ten percent or more of the company s consolidated net worth 
for purposes of regulation y  net consideration is the gross consideration paid by a company for all of its equity securities purchased or redeemed during the period  minus the gross consideration received for all of its equity securities sold during the period other than as part of a new issue 
however  a bank holding company need not obtain federal reserve board approval of any equity security redemption when i the bank holding company s capital ratios exceed the threshold established for well capitalized state member banks before and immediately after the redemption  ii the bank holding company is well managed  and iii the bank holding company is not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues 
the gramm leach bliley financial services modernization act of s 
the glba  provides bank holding companies  banks  securities firms  insurance companies  and investment management firms the option of engaging in a broad range of financial and related activities by opting to become a financial holding company 
these holding companies will be subject to oversight by the federal reserve board  in addition to other regulatory agencies 
under the financial holding company structure  bank holding companies have greater ability to purchase or establish nonbank subsidiaries which are financial in nature or which engage in activities which are incidental or complementary to a financial activity 
additionally  for the first time  securities and insurance firms are permitted to purchase full service banks 
while the glba act facilitates the ability of financial institutions to offer a wide range of financial services  large financial institutions would appear to be the beneficiaries as a result of this act because many community banks are less able to devote the capital and management resources needed to facilitate broad expansion of financial services

in applying these policies  management must make estimates and assumptions 
the accounting policy that is most susceptible to critical estimates and assumptions is the allowance for loan losses 
the determination of an appropriate provision is based on a determination of the probable amount of credit losses in the loan portfolio 
many factors influence the amount of future loan losses  relating to both the specific characteristics of the loan portfolio and general economic conditions nationally and locally 
while management carefully considers these factors in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments may be necessary due to changed conditions  which could have an adverse impact on reported earnings in the future

net interest and dividend income the company earns income from two basic sources 
the primary source is through the management of its financial assets and liabilities and involves functioning as a financial intermediary 
the company accepts funds from depositors or borrows funds and either lends the funds to borrowers or invests those funds in various types of securities 
the second source is fee income  which is discussed in the noninterest income section of this analysis 
net interest income is the difference between the interest and fees earned on loans  interest and dividends earned on securities the company s earning assets and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds  primarily in the form of advances from the federal home loan bank 
the amount by which interest income will exceed interest expense depends on two factors the volume or balance of earning assets compared to the volume or balance of interest bearing deposits and borrowed funds and the interest rate earned on those interest earning assets compared with the interest rate paid on those interest bearing deposits and borrowed funds

the increase in occupancy expense is also directly related to the merger

at december  approximately of the bank s loan portfolio was related to real estate products and although the portfolio increased during the year  the concentration remained consistent as approximately of the portfolio was related to real estate at december  the increase in total gross loans was primarily the result of an increase in construction mortgages 
otherwise there were no material changes in the composition of the loan portfolio during this period 
credit risk is inherent in the business of extending loans 
the bank monitors the quality of the portfolio to ensure that loan quality will not be sacrificed for growth or otherwise compromise the company s objectives 
because of the risk associated with extending loans the company maintains an allowance or reserve for credit losses through charges to earnings 
the loan loss provision for the year was  as compared to  for the year ended december  the level of nonperfoming loans remains low as a percentage of total loans 
nonperforming loans totaled  or of total loans at december  as compared to  or 
of total loans at december  nonperforming loans are closely monitored by management 
the bank evaluates the adequacy of the allowance on a monthly basis 
no material changes have been made in the estimation methods or assumptions that the bank used in making this determination during the year ended december  such evaluations are based on assessments of credit quality and risk rating of loans by senior management  which is submitted to the board of directors for approval 
loans are initially risk rated when originated 
if there is deterioration in the credit  the risk rating is adjusted accordingly 
the allowance also includes a component resulting from the application of the measurement criteria of statements of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan sfas 
impaired loans receive individual evaluation of the allowance necessary on a monthly basis 
loans to be considered for impairment are defined in the bank s loan policy as residential real estate mortgages with balances of  or more and commercial loans of  or more 
such loans are considered impaired when it is probable that the bank will not be able to collect all principal and interest due according to the terms of the note 
any such commercial loans and residential mortgages will be considered impaired under any of the following circumstances non accrual status  loans over days delinquent  troubled debt restructures consummated after december   or loans classified as doubtful  meaning that they have weaknesses  which make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions  and values  highly questionable and improbable 
the individual allowance for any impaired loan is based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
specifically identifiable and quantifiable losses are immediately charged off against the allowance 
in addition  a risk of loss factor is applied in evaluating categories of loans generally as part of the periodic analysis of the allowance for loan losses 
this analysis reviews the allocations of the different categories of loans within the portfolio and considers historical loan losses and delinquency figures as well as any recent delinquency trends 
the credit card delinquency and loss history is separately evaluated and given a special loan loss factor because management recognizes the higher risk involved in such loans 
concentrations of credit and local economic factors are also evaluated on a periodic basis 
historical average net losses by loan type are examined as well as trends by type 
the bank s loan mix over the same period of time is also analyzed 
a loan loss allocation is made for each type of loan multiplied by the loan mix percentage for each loan type to produce a weighted average factor 
there have been no reallocations within the allowance during the years ended december  and at december  the allowance for loan losses totaled  representing of nonperforming loans  which totaled  and of total loans of  this compares to  representing of nonperforming loans  which totaled  and of total loans of  at december  a total of  in loans was charged off during the year  as compared to  during a total of  of previously charged off loans was recovered during the year ended december  recoveries for the year totaled  when comparing the two years  net charge offs were  for the year and during the year net charge offs totaled  management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
while management estimates loan losses using the best available information  no assurances can be given that future additions to the allowance will not be necessary based on changes in economic and real estate market conditions  further information obtained regarding problem loans  identification of additional problem loans or other factors 
additionally  despite the overall good quality of the loan portfolio generally  with expectations of the company to continue to grow its existing portfolio  future additions to the allowance may be necessary to maintain adequate reserve coverage 
deposits the company offers a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms 
deposits at year end totaled  compared to  at year end this increase of  or can be primarily attributed to the deposits acquired with the merger of the canaan national bancorp  inc merger

these advances are made pursuant to various credit programs  each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities 
at december   the company had  in outstanding advances from the federal home loan bank compared to  at december  management expects that it will continue this strategy of supplementing deposit growth with advances from federal home loan bank of boston 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the company 
interest rate risk is defined as an exposure to a movement in interest rates that could have an adverse effect on net interest income 
net interest income is sensitive to interest rate risk to the degree that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice on a different basis than earning assets 
the bank s assets and liabilities are managed in accordance with policies established and reviewed by the bank s board of directors 
the bank s asset liability management committee monitors asset and deposit levels  developments and trends in interest rates  liquidity and capital 
one of the primary financial objectives is to manage interest rate risk and control the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates in order to prudently improve net interest income and manage the maturities and interest rate sensitivities of assets and liabilities 
to quantify the extent of these risks both in its current position and in actions it might take in the future  interest rate risk is monitored using gap analysis which identifies the differences between assets and liabilities which mature or reprice during specific time frames and model simulation which is used to rate shock the company s asset and liability balances to measure how much of the company s net interest income is at risk from sudden rate changes 
an interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
at december   the company was slightly asset sensitive positive gap 
this would suggest that the during a period of rising interest rates the company would be in a better position to invest in higher yielding assets resulting in growth in interest income 
to the contrary  during a period of falling interest rates  a positive gap would result in a decrease in interest income 
the level of interest rate risk at december  is within the limits approved by the board of directors 
liquidity liquidity is the ability to raise funds on a timely basis at an acceptable cost in order to meet cash needs 
adequate liquidity is necessary to handle fluctuation in deposit levels  to provide for customers credit needs  and to take advantage of investment opportunities as they are presented 
the company manages liquidity primarily with readily marketable investment securities  deposits and loan repayments 
the company s subsidiary  salisbury bank and trust company is a member of the federal home loan bank of boston which provides a source of available borrowings for liquidity 
at december   the company had approximately  in loan commitments outstanding 
management believes that the current level of liquidity is ample to meet the company s needs for both the present and foreseeable future 
capital at december   the company had  in shareholder equity compared to  at december  this represents an increase of  or 
several components contributed to the change since december earnings for the year totaled  market conditions have reduced unrealized securities gains and resulted in a negative adjustment to comprehensive income of  the company declared dividends in resulting in a decrease in capital of  the company issued new shares of common stock under the terms of the director stock retainer plan during the second quarter of which resulted in an increase in capital of  under current regulatory definitions  the company and the bank are considered to be well capitalized for capital adequacy purposes 
as a result  the bank pays the lowest federal deposit insurance deposit premiums possible 
one primary measure of capital adequacy for regulatory purposes is based on the ratio of risk based capital to risk weighted assets 
this method of measuring capital adequacy helps to establish capital requirements that are sensitive to the differences in risk associated with various assets 
it takes in account off balance sheet exposure in assessing capital adequacy and it minimizes disincentives to holding liquid  low risk assets 
at year end  the company had a risk based capital ratio of compared to at december  the primary difference results from the negative effect of market movements on unrealized gains and therefore a decrease in comprehensive income 
maintaining strong capital is essential to bank safety and soundness 
however  the effective management of capital resources requires generating attractive returns on equity to build value for shareholders while maintaining appropriate levels of capital to fund growth  meet regulatory requirements and be consistent with prudent industry practices 
management believes that the capital ratios of the company and bank are adequate to continue to meet the foreseeable capital needs of the institution 
as a result of the merger  each shareholder of canaan national bancorp  inc received shares of the company  in addition to in cash for each share of canaan national bancorp inc stock

at december   a total of  shares of the company common stock were issued and outstanding 
impact of inflation and changing prices the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require the measurement of financial condition and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money  over time  due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary and as a result  interest rates tend to have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services  inflation could impact earnings in future periods
