industry general background the semiconductor fabrication process begins with a bare silicon wafer a round disk that is six  eight or twelve inches in diameter  about as thick as a credit card and gray in color 
the process of manufacturing wafers is itself highly sophisticated  involving the creation of large ingots of silicon by pulling them out of a vat of molten silicon 
the ingots are then sliced into wafers and polished to a mirror finish on the side where the circuits are made 
the manufacturing cycle of integrated circuits is grouped into three phases design  fabrication and testing 
ic design involves the architectural layout of the circuit  as well as design verification and photomask or reticle generation 
the fabrication of an ic  or chip  is accomplished by depositing a series of film layers that act as conductors  semiconductors or insulators 
the deposition of these film layers is interspersed with numerous other process steps that create circuit patterns  remove portions of the film layers  and perform other functions such as heat treatment  measurement and inspection 
most advanced chip designs require over individual steps  many of which are performed multiple times 
most chips consist of two main structures the lower structure  typically consisting of transistors or capacitors  which perform the smart functions of the chip  and the upper structure  typically consisting of interconnect circuitry  which connects the components in the lower structure 
when all of the layers on the wafer have been completed  each die on the wafer is then tested for functionality 
the wafer is placed on a prober that is used to attach the input output pins of the device to a tester 
when chips are tested on the wafer  it is called sort test 
sort test determines which chips are good 
the wafer is then cut up  and the good die are bonded to lead frames that contain pins used to attach the chip to the outside printed circuit board 
wires are bonded from the input output pads of the ic to the pins of the lead frame 
then the lead frame is encapsulated in packages typically made of plastic or ceramic materials 
the packaged parts are put through a final test and then shipped to customers 
this entire packaging and testing process is called the back end 
current trends companies that anticipate future market demands by developing and refining new technologies and manufacturing processes are better positioned to lead in the semiconductor market 
during past industry cycles  semiconductor manufacturers generally contended with one key new technology or market trend  such as a specific design rule shrink 
in today s market  the leading semiconductor manufacturers are investing in bringing a multitude of new technologies into production at the same time  including copper interconnects  new substrate and transistor materials  advanced lithography techniques and mm inch wafers 
while many of these technologies have been adopted at the development and pilot production stages  significant challenges and risks associated with each technology have impacted their adoption into full volume production 
for example  as design rules decrease  yields become more sensitive to the size and density of defects  while device performance characteristics namely speed or capacity become more sensitive to such parameters as linewidth and film thickness variation 
copper introduces new physical defects  which are harder to find within the interconnect structure  as well as electrical defects  which cannot be detected using conventional optical inspection systems 
new process materials like low k dielectrics  silicon on insulator soi and nm photoresists require extensive characterization before they can be made manufacturable 
larger mm wafers are more susceptible to damage than mm wafers  since they can bend or bow twice as much  creating stress on the wafer that can result in yield loss 
film uniformity is also more difficult to maintain on these larger wafers 
moving several of these advanced technologies into production at once only adds to the risks that chipmakers face  since technical challenges in bringing any one of these into production could also slow the adoption of the other technologies 
the focus of our activities has been the development of new process control and yield management tools that enable chipmakers to accelerate the adoption of these new technologies into full volume production  while minimizing their associated risks 
with our portfolio of application focused technologies and our dedicated yield technology expertise  we are in a position to be a key supplier for comprehensive yield management solutions that enable our customers to achieve success for their next generation products 
the continuing evolution of semiconductor devices to smaller linewidth geometries and more complex multi level circuitry has significantly increased the cost and performance requirements of the capital equipment used to manufacture these devices 
construction of an advanced wafer fabrication facility today can cost over billion  a substantial increase over the cost of previous generation facilities 
as a result  chipmakers are demanding increased productivity and higher returns from their manufacturing equipment 
our process control and yield management equipment enables our customers to better leverage these increasingly expensive facilities and significantly improve their return on investment roi helping them to become low cost producers 
our process control and yield acceleration solutions accelerating the yield ramp and maximizing the production yields of high performance devices are key goals of modern semiconductor manufacturing 
achieving higher yields faster  along with higher performance characteristics  increases the revenue a manufacturer can obtain from each semiconductor wafer 
our systems are used to analyze product and process quality at critical points in the wafer  photomask and ic manufacturing process  and provide feedback to our customers so that fabrication problems can be identified  addressed and eliminated 
this ability to locate the source of defects and other process issues  as well as contain them  enables our customers to improve control over their manufacturing processes  as well as increase their yields and device value thus maximizing their roi and lowering their manufacturing costs 
the following are some of the methods used to accelerate yields and optimize device performance  all of which require the capture and analysis of data gathered through many measurements the most significant opportunities for yield and device performance improvement generally occur either when production is started at new factories or technology shifts in existing factories 
equipment that helps a manufacturer quickly increase new product yields and optimize device performance enables the manufacturer to offer these new products in high volumes early in the product lifecycle the time when they are likely to generate the greatest profits 
products we operate in one segment for the design  manufacture and marketing of process control and yield management systems for the semiconductor and related microelectronics industry 
we market and sell our hardware consisting of patterned and unpatterned wafer inspection  optical overlay metrology  e beam review  reticle and photomask inspection  spectroscopic and e beam based cd metrology  and film and surface measurement tools as well as our advanced yield analysis and defect classification software to provide fab wide yield management solutions that are optimized for the manufacturing process cells used in ic production  including lithography  etch  deposition and chemical mechanical planarization cmp 
our offerings can be broadly categorized into four groups defect inspection  metrology  service  and software and other 
in addition  for our customers that are manufacturing with older technologies we provide refurbished kla tencor certified tools along with warranty and support 
defect inspection our defect inspection tools are used to detect  count  classify and characterize particles  pattern defects  surface anomalies and electrical failures both inline at various manufacturing process stages and offline during engineering analysis 
our portfolio includes the tools necessary for our customers to detect  correlate and analyze physical and electrical defects  as well as determine and correct their cause 
high resolution brightfield imaging inspection our xxx wafer inspection series  first introduced in  set the standard for high sensitivity patterned wafer inspection through a unique combination of high speed image processing  an ultra broadband brightfield illumination source and our segmented auto threshold technology 
in  we introduced our latest generation ultraviolet uv based high resolution imaging inspection system  the  which incorporates multiple bandwidth brightfield illumination and other enhancements to extend the performance of the xxx series to the nm node and below 
that year  we also introduced our duv brightfield platform  the  which provides the increased defect detection resolution and sensitivity for the nm node 
the illuminates short duv broadband wavelengths through state of the art high numerical aperture na optics to greatly improve defect detection versus other technologies 
with the adoption of new materials  device structures and lithography techniques at the nm node and beyond  ic manufacturers face a plethora of new defect types and noise sources  as well as a dramatic rise in systematic defects 
the magnitude of these defect challenges mandate extremely sensitive and highly flexible inspection solutions capable of detecting the broadest range of defect types in all layers 
since different defect types  materials and device layers require different inspection wavelengths for optimal defect detection  ultra broadband wavelength imaging inspection is now a necessity 
in response to this need  kla tencor unveiled its new series ultra broadband brightfield inspection platform earlier this year  which combines deep ultraviolet duv  uv and visible wavelength illumination in a single platform to enable the identification of critical defects across all layers 
the series delivers both high sensitivity and production worthy performance that chipmakers need to accelerate their yield learning and fab roi 
high throughput darkfield inspection our advanced inspection technology ait wafer inspection family is designed to provide fast and accurate feedback on process tool performance  as well as advanced line monitoring for films  cmp  and non critical etch and photo modules 
the ait series uses double darkfield technology  which is a low angle illumination technique particularly effective for detecting defects on planar surfaces such as post cmp wafers 
first introduced in  the ait platform has been continually enhanced over the years with increasing levels of sensitivity and throughput to address the inspection needs for sub nm design rules 
earlier this fiscal year  we unveiled the puma  our latest generation darkfield inspection platform  which represents a marked departure from traditional laser scanning based darkfield tools 
puma combines a modular and extendible architecture with kla tencor s streak imaging technology to enable the high capture of critical defects at production throughputs 
scalable for multiple technology generations  streak combines advanced uv illumination optics with high speed imaging to provide a range of inspection modes optimized for critical defect detection 
a solid state linear sensor is used to image the scattered light  which extends the dynamic range of the sensor to produce a more stable and repeatable measurement than can be achieved with traditional scanning laser and photo multiplier tube pmt based inspection systems 
the platform s enhanced sensitivity over existing inspection systems  without compromising throughput  allows customers to cost optimize their inspection strategies and achieve tighter production control 
electrical line monitoring for advanced ic manufacturing  e beam inspection is essential not only during ic development  where the highest levels of sensitivity are needed to root out electrical defects  but also in production  where dedicated high speed e beam inspection systems are required at key process steps 
during fiscal year  we introduced the latest addition to our esxx series of e beam inspection systems targeted at nm ic development and production the es the es combines our advanced electron beam system architecture with our xx brightfield inspection software platform and provides high inspection sensitivity for development  with high throughput for production monitoring 
as part of the es  we also introduced our loop microloop methodology onto the esx platform for the first time 
the faster time to result advantage of loop versus traditional short loop electrical test methodologies  has made loop a key enabler for yield learning in advanced development and production fabs 
our loop microloop methodology  introduced in  provides a fab wide framework of solutions that accelerates yield learning for new semiconductor processes in development and production 
edo  the first product in the loop family  combines non contact electrical test with inline physical defect inspection to produce a fast root cause analysis 
wafer surface inspection the wafer substrate is the foundation of an ic 
having a defect free wafer substrate is essential  since defects on the surface of the wafer can adversely affect subsequent semiconductor processes and ultimately impact ic performance 
in the ic fab  wafer surface inspection is often used to qualify new process tools quickly in order to begin making product wafers as soon as possible 
wafer surface inspection is also critical for monitoring the defect performance of fab equipment during production to ensure they remain within specification 
in  we introduced the surfscan sp series  which is today considered the de facto standard for bare wafer qualification  process monitoring and equipment monitoring applications 
at the nm node and beyond  transistor performance in high end devices can no longer be improved by scaling alone 
new materials  including inline process films and engineered substrates  are also being added to augment transistor performance 
however  these new materials introduce new control parameters and challenges 
with engineered substrates  for example  traditional visible wavelength wafer inspection systems are hampered by interference effects arising from multiple reflections from interfaces between silicon and buried oxide box layers 
these cause false and inconsistent defect readings  and reduce overall defect sensitivity 
in  we unveiled our next generation surfscan platform  the surfscan sp  which incorporates a new uv illumination technology to significantly enhance inspection sensitivity and speed on both traditional silicon as well as engineered substrates such as soi  strained silicon  and strained soi 
the system is capable of detecting defects as small as nm at higher throughputs than the previous benchmark surfscan sp dls tool 
wafer backside defects can have a significant impact on wafer and process uniformity  both of which are critical issues in advanced mm processing 
in  we unveiled a new backside inspection module bsim option for the surfscan sp and sp series that provides an automated  non destructive inspection solution for the backsides of patterned production wafers 
transparent film and substrate inspection understanding the optical surface properties of modern materials has become a critical part of manufacturing in industries ranging from microelectronics to biomedicine 
with the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes and products comes the need for extremely precise analysis and control of surface properties such as film thickness uniformity  contamination and defectivity  often in real time and online 
this trend is paving the way for nondestructive optical metrology techniques to move into volume production environments 
through our acquisition of candela instruments during fiscal year  we added the candela tm series of optical surface analyzers osa to our inspection portfolio 
the osa systems automatically detect and classify surface defects on optoelectronic and semiconductor wafers  including transparent wafers such as sapphire and glass 
combining four technologies to simultaneously measure reflectivity and topographic variations on the surface  these systems enable detection of particles  stains  scratches  pits and bumps 
epi layers and film coatings can also be inspected for uniformity  particles  and surface defects 
macro after develop inspection macro defects  which can ruin the entire wafer  are costly to chipmakers in mm production  since more than twice the number of die are at risk with these larger wafers compared to mm wafers 
with the introduction of the macro defect inspection system in we enabled our customers to automate after develop inspection adi for macro defects 
designed to replace inefficient manual macro adi  the is an automated inspection system able to detect and classify front end macro lithographic defects  which are microns and larger in size 
in  we introduced the macro adi series  which brought the benefits of the to mm production 
photo cell monitoring the introduction of thinner photoresists  new resist chemistries  tighter process windows and smaller design rules have all given rise to new and smaller defect types within the lithography cell a large area of investment within the fab 
defect management in the lithography cell is thus critical for qualifying new lithography processes and establishing a benchmark for controlling defects and minimizing yield losses during production 
in  we introduced our pcm micro photo cell monitor solution to provide fabs with a methodology for identifying and eliminating lithography related micro defects before product lots are placed at risk 
combining our most advanced defect management hardware and software tools  a new reticle design  optimized test wafers and industry leading expertise  pcm provides the high sensitivity and capture rate required for reducing lithography related micro defects 
it monitors the health of the lithography cell and enables chipmakers to make rapid and accurate go no go decisions about their product reticles  track systems and exposure tools 
reticle inspection error free reticles are the first step in ensuring high yields in the manufacturing process  since defects in reticles can be replicated on wafers 
reticles are high precision quartz plates that contain microscopic images of electronic circuits 
placed into steppers or scanners  these reticles are used to transfer circuit patterns onto wafers to fabricate ics 
the extension of optical lithography below the nm node has resulted in the mask error enhancement factor  where reticle defects once too small to print on the wafer become enhanced in the lithography process to create yield killing wafer defects 
in  we unveiled our terastar reticle inspection system for high resolution reticle inspection down to the nm node 
with its ability to inspect up to a terapixel one million by one million pixels per reticle  terastar provides significant improvements in throughput compared to previous generation systems 
tera algorithms enable the inspection of smaller linewidth geometries and complex resolution enhancement techniques rets  such as optical proximity correction opc  assist features and phase shift masks psms 
its high throughput and sensitivity make terastar ideal for pre and post pelliclization inspection in photomask manufacturing operations  as well as incoming quality control and reticle re qualification in wafer fabs 
reticle cd errors are a major cause of yield loss in ic manufacturing at the nm node and below 
in  we introduced a new option on terastar  called teraflux  which detects minute but relevant cd errors on contact and via layer reticles prior to their first use in the wafer fab 
teraflux measures the energy that passes through the contact hole and compares it to another reference either die or database to look for unexpected energy variations 
this enables the terastar system to capture reticle cd defects  such as incorrectly sized contacts or semi transparencies both of which will adversely affect the amount of light passing through the contact holes during the lithography process 
by capturing these critical defects during reticle inspection and qualification  teraflux enables chipmakers to ramp their deep sub wavelength lithography processes into production  while minimizing the costs associated with scrapped wafers 
in  we introduced terascan  the successor to terastar 
a duv reticle inspection tool developed for sub nm ic production  terascan offers high sensitivity to detect classical defects intrusions  extrusions and point defects as small as nm  and cd defects as small as nm 
terascan has the ability to inspect nearly any type of photomask used in ic production  regardless of reticle wavelength and resolution enhancement technology  for sub nm design rules 
process window qualification reticles that are used in the manufacture of today s advanced ics incorporate extremely complex rets that enable lithographers to extend existing lithographic processes to print design rules smaller than the wavelength of light used a process called sub wavelength lithography 
these enhancements include billions of opc features and psm topography  which minutely adjust the wavelength of duv light 
if left unchecked  marginal ret designs can print as out of focus features on the wafer during photolithgraphy or not print at all  creating opens that translate into electrical failures within the device 
however  since these errors are design marginalities rather than physical defects on the reticle  they cannot be caught using traditional reticle inspection tools 
our process window qualification pwq solution enables device manufacturers to identify reticle design errors  such as marginalities in scattering bars  rule and model based opc  and psm  which can cause process window failure and adversely affect overall device yield 
pwq utilizes an intelligent wafer layout  inspected on kla tencor s xx and series high resolution imaging inspection systems  which enables lithographers to compare dies with modified lithography parameters against dies at optimized conditions 
the resulting data is analyzed with algorithms to identify and prioritize repeating regions of process window marginality 
this method enables lithographers to recognize problems that cause failure within the nominal process window or just outside of it allowing for more informed decisions about whether to have the reticle redesigned  or fine tune inline defect and cd monitoring efforts to minimize the design error impact on device yield 
metrology our metrology or process window optimization products provide virtually all of the critical measurements fabs require to manage their advanced manufacturing processes 
with our unique combination of overlay  critical dimension  film thickness and reflectivity measurements  ic manufacturers have the capabilities to maintain tight control of their lithography  etch  deposition and cmp processes 
optical overlay metrology decreasing linewidths  larger die sizes and increasing numbers of layers in semiconductor devices all affect the tolerances for layer to layer matching  or overlay  and can result in overlay misregistration errors a crucial cause of yield loss 
metrology systems are needed to measure the alignment between different layers of the semiconductor device to ensure overlay parameters are kept within specification 
in  we unveiled archer  which enables overlay measurements to within nm for sub nm and mm production 
to augment the performance of the archer  we introduced a new software tool in called archer analyzer that conducts fully automated  real time  on tool overlay metrology analysis 
seamlessly integrated with the archer  archer analyzer provides information  such as wafer lot dispositioning and stepper correction data  which helps chipmakers eliminate unnecessary wafer rework and quickly address variations in the performance of their lithography tools to minimize yield loss 
in fiscal year  we introduced archer aim  which leverages a grating style target technology to capture design rule overlay errors and improve the accuracy of stepper corrections 
archer targets are denser than traditional box in box targets  resulting in the collection of more process information for improved correlation to in device overlay performance 
in fiscal year  we introduced archer aim  our latest overlay metrology solution  which is designed to address chipmakers lithography overlay control needs beyond the nm node 
archer aim incorporates a new optic system design and improved illumination system to reduce total measurement uncertainty tmu  a key metric of overlay metrology performance and exceed the nm node overlay control requirements outlined in the edition of the international technology roadmap for semiconductors 
focus exposure control in lithography is a key challenge for cd control at sub nm nodes 
unseen lithography focus exposure excursions can result in cd process variations that lead to lower yields  cause unnecessary and costly rework  and reduce scanner productivity 
monitoring focus and exposure variations inline is thus critical to maintaining tight cd control at these advanced design rules 
our mpx option on our archer overlay metrology platform enables lithographers to detect and control stepper defocus and exposure variations on product wafers non destructively 
leveraging dual tone design targets and analysis software  mpx can simultaneously provide separate exposure and focus measurements on product wafers with a high degree of sensitivity and precision 
this enables mpx to provide fast and accurate feedback on the key parameters needed to maintain tight cd control without requiring periodic offline monitoring of the exposure tool 
e beam cd metrology every nanometer in cd variation in the ic manufacturing process affects device performance  which consequently impacts yield and bottom line profitability 
the ecd  which we introduced in fiscal year  offers the precision and resolution needed to meet the cd metrology performance requirements for the nm node and beyond 
the ecd is based on a new platform  and all of its design aspects have been precision suited for nm node metrology requirements  with extendibility to the nm node 
ecd is well suited for applications involving nm lithography and very high aspect ratio structures 
among its key features  the ecd incorporates imageplus  an operating mode that provides control over resolution and depth of focus to enable lithographers to optimize tool performance on features with several topographies 
with imageplus  the ecd can measure contacts at the bottom of structures with high aspect ratios 
another key feature  the flexscan off axis tilt capability  enables the ecd to generate d profile information sidewall angle  height on certain features providing enhanced in line process control 
unlike cd sem tilt systems that require stage movement or use magnetic deflection  the ecd is totally hysteresis free relying exclusively on electrostatic deflection 
as a result  tilt measurements can be performed without compromising metrology performance  thereby providing highly reliable and repeatable measurements 
optical cd metrology traditional cd linewidth measurements are no longer sufficient by themselves for providing all the information that chipmakers need to accurately predict yield and transistor performance 
today  complete feature profile information is needed  including cd  sidewall angle  height and depth 
contact hole profile measurements are also critical  since contact hole sizes that are significantly reduced or closed at the bottom of the structure can result in significant yield loss 
in  we introduced the spectracd our latest generation inline optical cd metrology system for advanced patterning process control at the nm and nm nodes 
spectracd utilizes a new hardware platform and advanced d modeling capabilities to conduct complete profile measurements of yield critical structures with an improvement in precision and tool to tool matching over our previous generation spectracd system 
these capabilities  coupled with spectracd s production throughput and ability to non destructively measure features down to nm  provide chipmakers with an effective inline process control and product dispositioning tool for their most critical patterning steps 
film measurement our film measurement products measure a variety of optical and electrical properties of thin films 
these products are used to control a wide range of wafer fabrication steps  where both within wafer and wafer to wafer process uniformity are of paramount importance to semiconductor manufacturers enabling them to achieve high device performance characteristics at low cost 
in  we unveiled spectrafx  which delivers the precision  matching and stability required for advanced film measurement applications for nm device production  including nm lithography processes 
designed to fully support next generation and operator free mm fabs with automation and tool to tool matching capabilities  spectrafx enables foundries and other multi product high volume chip manufacturers to reduce the process development time for advanced materials and accelerate their adoption into volume production 
traditional scatterometry based metrology systems obtain information on process conditions by measuring blank metal test structures in the wafer scribe lines 
at the nm node  process tolerances are so small that these traditional proxy measurements are unable to detect process variations at the die level  which can have a major impact on device performance 
in  we introduced spectrafx  our most advanced  seventh generation thin film metrology system  to enable ic manufacturers to achieve cost effective production control over their advanced film processes at the nm node and below 
based on our spectroscopic ellipsometry se technology  spectrafx utilizes a unique dielectric pattern metrology dpm capability to provide accurate and robust measurements of in die process variation on product wafers non destructively 
the system also leverages a new se option to enable qualification and monitoring of such advanced films as ultra thin ono layers  nitrided films  high k and low k dielectrics  nm anti reflective coating arc layers  and engineered substrates  including soi  strained silicon  and silicon germanium sige 
accufilm  an advanced option on our spectrafx platform  eliminates the effects of airborne molecular contamination amc on ultra thin film measurements 
a key roadblock to achieving control of advanced gate processes below the nm node  amc grows rapidly on film surfaces and degrades the accuracy and repeatability of gate dielectric metrology 
accufilm enables spectrafx to remove these contaminants from product wafers in a matter of seconds before taking film measurements at each measurement site without placing product at risk 
in  we introduced metrix  an inline  non contact metal films metrology system to provide independent measurements of both film composition and thickness on product wafers 
metrix can be used for a wide range of applications ranging from process development and characterization of ultra thin atomic layer deposition ald barrier films  high k dielectrics and nitrided metal gates  to routine production monitoring of copper barrier seed and other yield limiting critical layers such as silicon oxynitride sion gate dielectrics 
contamination monitoring gate dielectric quality is critical to the speed and reliability of an ic 
below the nm node  dielectrics become so thin less than angstroms  or the equivalent of nm that electrical performance characteristics of the dielectric films become just as critical as physical characteristics in determining overall transistor performance 
our quantox product line provides non contact  inline electrical performance measurements of key parameters that determine the quality of advanced gate dielectric films  including contamination and oxide thickness  as well as electrical capacitance and leakage 
our latest addition to this product family  called quantox xp  provides information on both the physical and electrical properties of advanced gate dielectric materials 
these materials include sion and high k dielectrics  which are required for advanced ic production 
quantox xp data provides high correlation to device electrical test data  enabling chipmakers to predict transistor performance inline  rather than having to wait until end of line electrical test a process that normally can take days or weeks to complete 
surface metrology our stylus profilers measure the surface topography of films and etched surfaces  and are used in basic research and development as well as semiconductor production and quality control 
the latest generation of our hrp high resolution profilers  the hrp etch  combines the dishing and erosion measurement capabilities of our long scan profilers with high aspect ratio etched feature measurement capability  which has historically been limited to atomic force microscopes afm 
this allows customers to monitor their critical etch processes  such as shallow trench isolation sti and dual damascene via trench 
we also provide stress measurement systems and capabilities  such as our new wafer bow and wafer stress option for our aset fx and spectrafx thin film metrology tools  which detects reliability related problems such as film cracking  voiding and lifting

klarity defect is our automated inline defect analysis module and defect data management system designed to help fabs achieve faster yield learning cycles 
by identifying excursions in real time  klarity defect enables fabs to embed expert decision making processes within analysis recipes 
these processes are automatically triggered when user specified events occur 
in addition to freeing fab engineers from repetitive analysis tasks  this capability dramatically improves fab operating efficiency by providing relevant information in less time and with less effort for faster identification of yield problems 
our klarity ace yield analysis software enables fast integration  correlation and analysis of yield and process related data to accurately determine the source of defects and process excursions 
it can differentiate between random and systematic yield problems  providing users with the data they need in order to take appropriate corrective measures 
in fiscal year  we introduced klarity ssa spatial signature analysis  a new software capability that provides automated classification and root cause analysis of spatial signatures  which are defect clusters and patterns that can be indicative of an out of spec process or process tool problem 
klarity ssa can be utilized for a variety of applications where enhanced excursion detection is needed  including process line and tool monitoring  as well as engineering analysis  across key process modules 
with our acquisition of finle technologies in  we developed our klarity prodata lithography data analysis software  which  along with our prolith lithography and etch simulation software  helps manufacturers reduce their advanced lithography development time and cost  as well as optimize their design for manufacturing dfm efforts 
our impact xp automated defect classification adc software provides consistent and accurate classification of yield limiting defects to help our customers accelerate their ramp to higher process yields 
impact xp incorporates our smartgallery tool  which reduces the setup time associated with adc implementation in fabs 
this is a critical requirement  particularly for foundries and application specific integrated circuit asic manufacturers  who specialize in short runs of multiple products 
our real time classification rtc and iadc technologies  which provide classification and binning of defect types in real time during inspection  are critical features on all of our latest generation e beam and optical inspection tools
