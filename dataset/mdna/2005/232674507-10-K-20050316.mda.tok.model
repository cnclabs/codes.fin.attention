item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are committed to being the innovator and leader in providing products for the treatment of patients with functional somatic syndromes and other central nervous system disorders 
functional somatic syndromes refer to several related syndromes characterized more by symptoms  suffering and disability than by disease specific abnormalities that are found upon physical examination and include many overlapping pain and psychiatric conditions such as fibromyalgia syndrome  or fms  irritable bowel syndrome  non cardiac chest pain and interstitial cystitis  or chronic pelvic pain 
our goal is to be the first to commercialize a product approved in the united states for the treatment of fms  the focus of our initial efforts in the area of functional somatic syndromes 
in january  we entered into a collaboration agreement with forest laboratories  inc  a leading marketer of central nervous system drugs with a strong franchise in the primary care and psychiatric markets  for the development and marketing of milnacipran 
we are currently running the first phase iii trial for milnacipran  which was commenced in october enrollment in this trial was completed in december  with results expected to be available in the fall of in october  forest laboratories initiated the second phase iii trial evaluating milnacipran for the treatment of fms 
these two phase iii trials and any additional studies needed for regulatory approval could possibly be completed in and  if successful  a new drug application  or nda  for fms could possibly be submitted later in that year at the earliest 
we completed a phase ii trial evaluating milnacipran for the treatment of fms in the fall of the phase ii trial was a three month  randomized  placebo controlled study involving sites and fms patients who were randomized to either milnacipran treatment or placebo 
in this clinical trial  milnacipran was shown to provide statistically significant improvement in pain  the primary symptom of fms 
no unexpected safety concerns arose from this trial and there were no serious adverse events 
we obtained an exclusive license for milnacipran from pierre fabre medicament in milnacipran has been marketed outside of the united states since as an antidepressant and has been used by over  patients worldwide 
we have paid pierre fabre a total of million  including upfront payments of million in connection with the execution of the original license agreement in and a million milestone payment in september  and issued pierre fabre  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock in connection with an amendment to the agreement with pierre fabre 
additional payments to pierre fabre of up to a total of million will be due to pierre fabre based on meeting certain clinical and regulatory milestones 
under our agreement with forest laboratories  we sublicensed our rights to milnacipran to forest laboratories for the united states  with an option to extend the territory to include canada 
additionally  forest laboratories assumed responsibility for funding all continuing development of milnacipran  including the funding of clinical trials and regulatory approval  as well as a specified number of our employees 
however  in light of the increased expense and risk associated with running two parallel trials  we are discussing an alternative cost sharing arrangement with forest laboratories for the second phase iii trial only and are currently working towards formalizing an amendment to our agreement with forest laboratories 
in connection with these discussions  the amount of funding that we receive from forest laboratories for certain of our employees has been eliminated as of the fourth quarter in  and we will pay for a majority of the external costs of the second phase iii trial only  with forest reimbursing us under specific scenarios where the second phase iii trial is used as one of the two required pivotal trials in the nda submission to the fda and with a premium under certain additional circumstances 
forest laboratories will also be responsible for sales and marketing activities related to any product developed under the agreement  while we have the option to co promote using our own sales force up to of the total physician details and would be reimbursed by forest in an amount equal to forest s cost of providing the equivalent detailing calls 
in august  we entered into a reformulation and new product agreement with collegium pharmaceutical  inc pursuant to which collegium is attempting to develop new formulations of milnacipran and new products that are analogs of milnacipran 
in january  we exercised our option to acquire an exclusive license to technology developed under this agreement 
in the event we commercialize any of the reformulations or new products developed under our agreement with collegium  we will be obligated to pay collegium milestone payments of up to million in the aggregate upon achievement of defined clinical and regulatory objectives  as well as potential royalty payments based on the net sales of reformulated or new products 
in october  we also entered into a common stock issuance agreement with collegium  pursuant to which collegium may elect to be issued shares of our common stock  subject to certain conditions  in lieu of cash  for milestone payments 
we are continuing to evaluate other various potential strategic transactions  including the potential acquisitions of products  technologies and companies  and other alternatives that we believe may enhance stockholder value 
as of december   we had working capital of approximately million and an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our future success depends on our ability to develop and market new products for the treatment of functional somatic syndromes  such as fms  and other central nervous system disorders 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues we recognized revenues under our collaborative agreement of million for the year ended december  compared to no revenue for the year ended december  the revenues recorded during consist solely of amounts earned pursuant to our collaboration agreement with forest laboratories for the development and marketing of milnacipran  entered into in january such revenues include the recognition of the upfront payment of million from forest laboratories on a straight line basis over a period of years  funding received from forest laboratories for certain of our employees devoted to the development of milnacipran and sponsored development reimbursements 
we currently are not generating any revenues from product sales and we do not expect to generate revenues from product sales for at least the next several years  if at all 
until we generate revenues from product sales  we expect our revenues to consist of the continued recognition on a straight line basis of the upfront payment of million  sponsored development reimbursements and possible future milestone payments under our agreement with forest laboratories  which are contingent upon the achievement of agreed upon objectives 
in connection with discussions with forest laboratories regarding cost sharing arrangements for the second phase iii trial only  the amount of funding that we receive from forest laboratories for certain of our employees has been eliminated as of the fourth quarter in additionally  the amount of sponsored development reimbursements from forest laboratories may change periodically based on the level of development activity 
our collaboration agreement is subject to early termination by forest laboratories upon specified events  including breach of the agreement 
research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in research and development expenses is primarily attributable to increased costs in connection with our first phase iii clinical trial for milnacipran due to a full year of activity during and costs incurred during in connection with the extension trial and our second phase iii trial for milnacipran 
during  we incurred total costs of million in connection with our phase iii programs compared to a total of million during research and development expenses during included a non cash charge in the amount of million recognized during the second quarter of in connection with the issuance of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock to pierre fabre under the restated pierre fabre agreement and costs incurred during the first quarter of related to the phase ii clinical trial for milnacipran  which was in its final completion stage during the first quarter of the costs for the first phase iii clinical trial and extension trial incurred during are being reimbursed by forest laboratories as noted below 
effective january   pursuant to our collaboration agreement with forest laboratories  forest laboratories assumed responsibility for funding all continuing development of milnacipran  including the funding of clinical trials and regulatory approvals 
this funding received from forest laboratories for sponsored development reimbursements is included as a component of our revenue under collaborative agreement on the statement of operations 
however  in light of the increased expense and risk associated with running two parallel trials  we are discussing an alternative cost sharing arrangement with forest laboratories for the second phase iii trial only and are currently working towards formalizing an amendment to our agreement with forest laboratories 
in connection with these discussions  we will pay for a majority of the external costs of the second phase iii trial only  with forest reimbursing us under specific scenarios where the second phase iii trial is used as one of the two required pivotal trials in the nda submission to the fda and with a premium under certain additional circumstances 
in addition  as discussed below in non cash compensation charges  we recognized non cash compensation expense of  and  related to research and development expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively  and as discussed below in compensation expense benefit variable stock options  we recognized a compensation benefit for variable stock options of  and compensation expense for variable stock options of  related to research and development expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to a success based fee paid to our investment bankers in connection with the closing of our collaboration agreement with forest laboratories  a one time fee associated with our being listed during the first quarter of on the nasdaq national market  increased wages and benefits expense associated with an increase in headcount  increased consulting costs and travel expenses in connection with business development activities surrounding potential strategic transactions and increased business insurance costs 
in addition  as discussed below in non cash compensation charges  we recognized non cash compensation expense of million and  related to general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively  and as discussed below in compensation expense benefit variable stock options  we recognized a compensation benefit for variable stock options of  and compensation expense for variable stock options of million related to general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
non cash compensation charges non cash compensation charges for the year ended december  were million  consisting of approximately  related to research and development expenses and million related to general and administrative expenses  compared to  consisting of approximately  related to research and development expenses and  related to general and administrative expenses  for the year ended december  the increase in non cash compensation charges is primarily due to i non recurring  non cash compensation charges recognized during the first quarter of  consisting of million related to stock options previously granted to consultants and two former board members for services that vested upon the execution of the collaboration agreement with forest laboratories and million related to the accounting treatment for stock options in connection with the resignation of certain board members to roles as consultants during the first quarter of  ii a non recurring  non cash compensation charge in the amount of  recognized during the second quarter of related to the issuance of warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock to an outside consultant as compensation for services provided  and iii an increase in the black scholes valuation for stock options previously granted to consultants due to the overall average increase in our stock price 
these options are being expensed over their related vesting period 
compensation expense benefit variable stock options in june  we implemented an option cancel and re grant program  which resulted in variable accounting for the newly issued options under financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin  accounting for certain transaction involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb during the year ended december   as the intrinsic value of the common stock underlying the options declined due to a decrease in our stock price during the period  we recognized a compensation benefit of  consisting of  related to research and development expenses and  related to general and administrative expenses 
in contrast  due to an increase in our stock price during the year ended december   we recognized compensation expense of million  consisting of  related to research and development expenses and million related to general and administrative expenses 
in the event our stock price is above closing price on december  on march   we will record additional compensation charges however  we cannot predict what our stock price will be in the future and it may be substantially lower than 
interest income interest income for the year ended december  was million compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in interest income for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in is due to higher cash and investment balances during achieved primarily through the upfront payment received from forest laboratories in january and the proceeds from our secondary offering completed in april  and a general increase in interest rates and related yields experienced during comparison of years ended december  and revenues we had no revenue for the year ended december  compared to revenue of million for the year ended december  pursuant to the second restructured agreement with fresenius  the agreement was modified to clarify that the million upfront fee received under the first restructured agreement was not refundable under any circumstances and therefore  the entire million of remaining deferred revenue as of december  was recognized as revenue in the first quarter of as a result of the modification to our agreement with fresenius reflected in the second restructured agreement  the and revenues are not comparable 
in addition  as a result of this modification  we will not recognize additional revenue  if any  under our agreement with fresenius until at the earliest  january   when we may receive a one time payment of million  million or no payment at all 
research and development research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in research and development expenses is primarily attributable to the non cash charge in the amount of million recognized during the second quarter of in connection with the issuance of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock to pierre fabre under the restated pierre fabre agreement  costs incurred during of approximately million in connection with our phase iii clinical trials for milnacipran  including expenses for clinical research organization and trial consultants  and higher bonuses for research and development executives accrued in the fourth quarter of following commencement of the phase iii clinical trial of milnacipran 
during the year ended december   we incurred costs of approximately million related to the phase ii clinical trial for milnacipran compared to corresponding costs of million during  as all costs associated with the phase ii trial were substantially completed by the first quarter of in addition  as discussed below in non cash compensation charges  we recognized non cash compensation expense of  and  related to research and development expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively  and as discussed below in compensation expense benefit variable stock options  we recognized compensation expense for variable stock options of  and a compensation benefit for variable stock options of  related to research and development expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to executive bonuses accrued in the fourth quarter of and increased legal  consulting and travel costs related to business development activities in  including costs incurred in connection with our collaboration agreement with forest laboratories 
during  we incurred initial set up costs related to the implementation of a database for our physician and patient registries focused on patients with fms and physicians that treat patients with fms that were not incurred during in addition  as discussed below in non cash compensation charges  we recognized non cash compensation expense of  and  related to general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively  and as discussed below in compensation expense benefit variable stock options  we recognized compensation expense for variable stock options of million and a compensation benefit for variable stock options of  related to general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
non cash compensation charges non cash compensation charges for the year ended december  were  consisting of approximately  related to research and development expenses and  related to general and administrative expenses  compared to  consisting of approximately  related to research and development expenses and  related to general and administrative expenses  for the year ended december  the increase in non cash compensation charges is primarily due to an increase in the black scholes value for stock options granted to consultants due to the increase experienced in our stock price during and an increase in the number of consultant options that vested during these options are being expensed over their related vesting period 
compensation expense benefit variable stock options in connection with the option cancel and re grant program implemented in june  which resulted in variable accounting for the newly issued options under fin  we recognized compensation expense of million for the year ended december  compared to a compensation benefit of  for the year ended december  during the year ended december   as the intrinsic value of the common stock underlying the options increased due to an increase in our stock price during the period  we recognized compensation expense of million  consisting of  related to research and development expenses and million related to general and administrative expenses 
in contrast  as our stock price decreased during the year ended december   we recognized a compensation benefit of  consisting of  related to research and development expenses and  related to general and administrative expenses 
interest income interest income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income during is primarily due to a change in the composition of our cash and cash equivalents balance and lower rates offered for our cash investments 
during the year ended december   a majority of our cash balance was invested in short term investments classified as available for sale whereby unrealized gains or losses are recorded as a component of stockholders equity  compared to the corresponding period in  during which our cash balance was invested in money market accounts 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million compared to cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million at december  working capital at december  totaled million compared to million at december  we have invested a substantial portion of our available cash in high quality marketable debt instruments of governmental agencies and certificates of deposit  which are within federally insured limits 
we have established guidelines relating to our investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million for the year ended december  compared to net cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  the primary source of cash from operations during was the upfront payment of million received from forest laboratories  offset by cash used in operations of approximately million 
the primary use of cash during was to fund our operating activities during the period 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net cash used in investing activities during compared to was primarily a result of the increase in the level of activity related to the purchase of short term investments  net of the proceeds from the sale of short term investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net cash provided by financing activities during compared was primarily the result of proceeds of approximately million from the completion of our public offering of common stock during april and proceeds of approximately million from the exercise of stock options and warrants during  compared to net proceeds of approximately million from the private placement of our common stock and warrants to purchase our common stock completed in april and proceeds of approximately million from the exercise of stock options and warrants during the following table summarizes our long term contractual obligations at december  total less than year years after years capital leases  including interest payments operating leases purchase obligations total purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services  including consulting services  that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms 
this includes contracts that are cancelable with notice and the payment of an early termination penalty 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty and also exclude liabilities to the extent presented on the balance sheet as of december  other commercial commitments include certain potential milestone  sublicense and royalty payments to pierre fabre and collegium discussed in the overview section 
contractual obligations for which we will be reimbursed by forest laboratories are not included in the table above 
in light of the increased expense and risk associated with running two parallel trials  we are discussing an alternative cost sharing arrangement with forest laboratories for the second phase iii trial only and are currently working towards formalizing an amendment to our agreement with forest laboratories 
in connection with these discussions  we will pay for a majority of the external costs of the second phase iii trial only  with forest reimbursing us under specific scenarios where the second phase iii trial is used as one of the two required pivotal trials in the nda submission to the fda with a premium under certain additional circumstances 
until we can consistently generate significant cash from our operations  we expect to continue to fund our operations with existing cash resources that were primarily generated from the proceeds of offerings of our equity securities and from revenue from our collaboration agreement 
our current expected primary cash needs on both a short term and long term basis are for the identification  acquisition or license  and development of potential future products  development of current products  working capital and other general corporate purposes 
in addition to the amounts required to pay any amounts payable under our agreements with pierre fabre and collegium  costs of in licensing or acquiring additional compounds or companies  funding external research and funding clinical development for any product that we may in license or acquire  we estimate that based on our current business plan  we will require approximately million to fund our operations for the year one of our goals for is to identify and in license a new product 
in the event we acquire  license or develop any new products  the amount to fund our operations for would increase  possibly materially 
we expect the current trend of net losses to continue for at least the next several years as we seek to acquire  license or develop additional products for the treatment of functional somatic syndromes and other central nervous system disorders 
such losses may fluctuate  and the fluctuations may be substantial 
based on our current business plan  we believe our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at december  are sufficient to fund operations for the next several years 
we are actively continuing to evaluate various potential strategic transactions  including the potential acquisitions of products and companies  and other alternatives that we believe may enhance stockholder value 
in order to acquire or develop additional products  we will require additional capital 
the amount of capital we require is dependent upon many forward looking factors that could significantly increase our capital requirements  including the following the extent to which we acquire or invest in other products and businesses  the costs of in licensing drug candidates  the ability of forest laboratories and us to reach milestones  and other events or developments under our collaboration agreement  the costs and timing of development and regulatory approvals for milnacipran  and the costs of commercialization of any future products 
because we are unable to predict the outcome of the foregoing factors  some of which are beyond our control  we are unable to estimate with certainty our mid to long term capital needs 
until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue  if ever  we expect to finance future capital needs through public or private debt or equity offerings or collaboration and licensing arrangements  as well as interest income earned on cash balances 
we do not currently have any commitments for future external funding 
we may not be able to raise additional capital through such sources and the funds we raise  if any  may not allow us to maintain our current and planned operations 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development of future additional product candidates 
to date  we have not had any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  research and development expenses and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following are some of the more critical accounting policies that affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements see also the notes to our financial statements 
revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements as amended by sab  revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
amounts received for upfront license fees under multiple element arrangements are deferred and recognized over the period of such services or performance if such arrangements require on going services or performance 
accordingly  the upfront payment of million from forest laboratories is being recognized over a period of years  which represents the estimated period of significant on going services and performance  including the development period  under our agreement with forest laboratories 
amounts received for sponsored development activities  including funding received for certain of our employees  are recognized as research costs are incurred over the period specified in the related agreement or as the services are performed 
amounts received for milestones are recognized upon achievement of the milestone  which requires substantive effort and was not readily assured at the inception of the agreement 
any amounts received prior to satisfying revenue recognition criteria will be recorded as deferred revenue 
research and development expenses we expense research and development costs as they are incurred pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs  as the ultimate commercialization of the related products is uncertain and the technology has no alternative uses 
in connection with our agreement with pierre fabre  we have paid certain upfront and milestone payments and are also obligated to make additional payments based on meeting certain clinical and regulatory milestones 
such upfront and milestone payments are expensed as incurred pursuant to sfas we also issued pierre fabre  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock in the second quarter of in connection with the restated pierre fabre agreement 
pursuant to sfas  the additional license consideration in the form of these equity instruments has been expensed as the ultimate commercialization of the related product is uncertain and the technology has no alternative uses 
stock based compensation we grant stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
accordingly  we ordinarily recognize no compensation expense for stock option grants to employees provided that the option exercise price is not less than the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
the value of options or stock awards issued to non employees has been determined in accordance with sfas and emerging issues task force no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring or in conjunction with selling goods and services  and is periodically re measured as the options vest 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded compensation expense of million including million related to stock options that vested upon the execution of the collaboration agreement with forest laboratories and  respectively  related to options issued to consultants 
additionally  during the year ended december   we recorded compensation expense of million in connection with the accounting treatment for stock options related to the resignation of certain board members during the first quarter of and compensation expense of  in connection with the issuance of warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock to an outside consultant as compensation for services provided 
in june  we implemented an option cancel and re grant program  which resulted in variable accounting for the newly issued options under financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin  accounting for certain transaction involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb pursuant to fin  the intrinsic value of the options to purchase common stock will be re measured at the end of each period for the term of the option and amortized over the vesting period 
during the year ended december   as the intrinsic value of the common stock underlying the options declined due to a decrease in our stock price during the period  we recognized a compensation benefit of  during the year ended december   as the intrinsic value of the common stock underlying the options increased due to an increase in our stock price during the period  we recognized compensation expense of million 
in the event our stock price is above closing price on december  on march   we will record additional compensation charges however  we cannot predict what our stock price will be in the future and it may be substantially lower than 
pursuant to the option cancel and re grant program  options with certain exercise prices held by certain of our employees  including executive officers  and directors were exchanged for options with an exercise price of  the fair market value of our common stock on june   the date the program was effected 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement supercedes apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and amends sfas  statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas  however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective method or a modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after that date  and based on the requirements for sfas for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas r 
under the modified retrospective method  the requirements are the same as under the modified prospective method  but also permits companies to restate financial statements of previous periods based on proforma disclosures made in accordance with sfas we currently utilize the black scholes model to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
while sfas r permits companies to continue to use such model  it also permits the use of a lattice model 
we have not yet determined which model we will use to measure the fair value of employee stock options under the adoption for sfas r 
the new standard is effective for periods beginning after june  and we expect to adopt sfas r on july  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options granted with exercise prices equal to or greater than the fair value of our common stock on the date of the grant 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on the level of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss and net loss per share in the notes to the financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we have invested our excess cash in united states government securities  certificates of deposit and money market funds with strong credit ratings 
as a result  our interest income is most sensitive to changes in the general level of united states interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions in any material fashion 
accordingly  we believe that  while the investment grade securities we hold are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
a hypothetical adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our financial instruments that are exposed to changes in interest rates
