executive overview our business our goal is to enable a better way for trusted commerce by delivering risk management  payment and outsourcing solutions that strengthen our customers overall profitability through increased revenue  reduced costs and improved operating efficiency and technology performance 
our principal focus is on issuers of transaction accounts  such as financial institutions  financial services companies  electronic funds networks  retailers  government agencies  telecommunications companies and other businesses 
in evaluating our financial condition and operating results  our management focuses on revenues  operating income  return on invested capital roic and cash flows 
during the historical periods presented herein  our four principal business lines were electronic payments risk management global outsourcing automated teller machine atm management our most profitable business segments were electronic payments  risk management and global outsourcing 
on november   we sold the portfolio of atm machines and merchant contracts the atm portfolio associated with our former atm management segment and entered into a five year master services agreement msa with the buyer 
the atm portfolio represented a significant component of our atm management segment and we are not presenting our atm management business as a separate operating segment in periods subsequent to the consummation of this transaction 
pursuant to the msa  we are providing processing  help desk  cash management  and other services to the buyer 
the processing service revenues and related costs of the msa have been reported within our electronic payments segment and the atm management service revenues and related costs have been reported within our global outsourcing segment 
amounts received by us in connection with the sale of the atm portfolio and the msa exceeded the book value of the atm portfolio by approximately million 
these excess proceeds were recorded as a deferred gain and are being amortized as a reduction in the other operating costs of our global outsourcing segment on a straight line basis over the initial five year term of the msa beginning on the consummation date of that agreement 
as of december   the total deferred gain related to the excess proceeds was million of which million was recorded as current deferred revenues and gains and the remainder was included in long term deferred gains 
the amortization of the deferred gain will increase the operating income of our global outsourcing segment by approximately million per year during the five year term of that agreement 
we have  however  modified our prior approach to accounting for this agreement and we will not be recognizing any revenues as a result of this amortization in future periods 
the business model of each of our segments is summarized below 

table of contents electronic payments this segment derives its revenue based upon our customers needs to process electronic transactions 
the majority of this segment s revenue is derived from processing debit transactions that originate at an atm or point of sale device 
we also derive revenue from providing electronic benefit transfer ebt services to government agencies 
the remaining revenue from this segment is derived from the licensing  maintenance and support of our electronic funds transfer eft software 
the provision of eft processing services requires substantial capital investment for computers and related peripherals  maintenance  system modifications and upgrades  security and redundancy 
although these requirements add barriers to competitive entrance  they also create a relatively high ratio of fixed operating costs to total costs 
processors are also required to maintain significant cash reserves to cover temporary differences in the flow of funds associated with electronic funds transfers 
additionally  the software applications used for processing at our data centers and which we license to our software customers are primarily developed in house and require frequent compliance updates and competitive upgrades  creating a dependence upon experienced and qualified information technology it personnel 
the costs we incur for technology improvement are necessary for us to ensure our products are continuously enhanced to provide our customers with up to date processing capabilities 
we are also required to incur compliance costs in connection with national and regional network requirements 
other operating expenses include telecommunications costs to support the transmission of electronic debit transactions and settlement 
we focus on increasing the recurring revenue base of this business through  among other things  the retention of our current eft and ebt processing customers and the acquisition of new processing relationships 
expanding our software sales  enhancing our processing product suite and establishing a processing presence in foreign markets are also areas of management emphasis 
risk management this segment derives its revenue from database inquiries from financial institutions and retailers seeking to comply with regulations or mitigate the risk associated with accepting checks  providing credit or opening debit accounts for new consumers 
revenue from financial institutions represented the majority of this segment s revenue in and the balance of the segment s revenue was derived from retail customers using our check verification service 
operating costs generally include data acquisition and analytic development costs  the cost of technology  regulatory compliance infrastructure and customer support centers 
our primary efforts in managing this business are directed towards increasing its revenues by improving customer usage rates and expanding our product suite and customer set 
global outsourcing our global outsourcing business derives its revenues from the need of companies to remain competitive through reducing costs while maintaining or improving service levels 
revenues in this segment were derived from a variety of business process outsourcing bpo services to the financial services  retail  telecommunications and government sectors through our us and india based delivery centers 
our bpo services include account acquisition assistance  credit card and brokerage support  call centers  loan processing  data entry and systems maintenance 
operating costs in this segment are primarily related to employee expense  telecommunications and facilities costs 
our principal goal for this business is to expand its customer base in our core target markets of financial services  retail and telecommunications companies 
additionally  we continually pursue opportunities to expand our service offerings to existing customers 
atm management our atm management segment derived its revenues from the use  sale and maintenance of atms 
surcharge and interchange revenue represented the majority of our revenue from this segment in equipment sales were non recurring and  along with branding fees  represented a minority of the revenue in this segment 
operating costs in this segment primarily included processing and telecommunication costs  the cost of the equipment we sold and the residual payments we made to the merchants where the atms we managed were deployed 
we sold our atm portfolio during the fourth quarter of and we have not treated our atm management activities as a separate operating segment after this sale 
key events in we sold our atm portfolio and entered into a five year master services agreement under which we provide atm processing and management services to the buyer  we reached a final settlement with respect to the investigation by the securities and exchange commission sec regarding the restatement of our prior period financial statements in  the us district court dismissed a federal securities action that had been filed against us related to these restatements

lehmann and william j 
ryan joined our board of directors  we transferred the listing of our common stock to the new york stock exchange  we acquired penley inc  which provides identity verification services to financial institutions  loss control solutions  which offers fraud investigation case management software  and benton consulting partners  a provider of consulting services to the electronic payments industry  we executed an eft software license with the united states postal service  through our alliance with mastercard  we signed a contract with a tier i financial institution  and the open systems software provider we acquired during did not meet our expectations 
trends our strategic planning and forecasting processes include the consideration of economic  industry wide and company specific trends that may impact our customers  competitors and operations 
we would identify the more material positive and negative trends affecting our business as the following increased fraud and identity theft and regulatory requirements are driving a sustained need for risk management products  although the rate of growth in this business is slowing as many customers and potential customers have already implemented required screening procedures  revenues from our legacy check verification business have been declining 
we expect this trend to continue  there continues to be a migration from the use of traditional paper checks to electronic payments and we are seeing an improving pipeline for our electronic payment processing business  we expect our revenues from our government service ebt business to decline significantly in  our eft software sales have tended to relate to product enhancements  customization and maintenance as opposed to new installations  increased outsourcing as a means to control costs is driving demand for offshore outsourcing services as well as an increased level of interest in developing expanded offshore capabilities by industry participants  the use of offshore outsourcing services continues to be a point of political debate  our india operations continue to experience pressure on compensation costs as competition increases  our revenues from existing it outsourcing customers declined substantially in and will likely continue to decline  our earnings per share have increased proportionately more than our revenues because we have effectively managed our costs  and we expect this trend to continue  and consolidation in industries we serve is resulting in increasing competition and pricing pressures 
risks and challenges in addition to the trends affecting our industry and company as noted above  we consider risks and challenges that could impact the company s future financial results  including the following and those described in exhibit to this annual report on form k estimates of future financial results are inherently unreliable 
our ability to expand through acquisitions involves risks and may not be successful 
consolidation in the industries we serve may adversely affect our ability to sell our products and services 
we are unable to predict the results of the purported class action lawsuit filed in florida 
we face intense competition in all areas of our business  and if we do not compete effectively  our business will be harmed 
if we experience system failures  the products and services we provide to our customers could be delayed or interrupted  which could harm our business and reputation and result in the loss of customers 
legislation or regulation would harm our ability to collect and use data  increase our operating costs or otherwise harm our business 
if the security of our databases is compromised  our reputation could suffer and customers may not be willing to use our products and services 
we may experience software defects  development delays and installation difficulties  which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability 
there are a number of risks associated with our international sales and operations that could harm our business 

table of contents changes in india tax laws could adversely affect our results of operations 
we face termination and compliance risks with respect to our government contracts and we expect our revenues from this business to decline in upcoming periods 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights

product line amounts in prior periods have 
table of contents been reclassified to conform with this presentation 
customer reimbursed fees represent certain telecommunications costs  network fees and travel  maintenance and repair costs that are billed to and reimbursed by our customers 
electronic payments electronic payments segment revenues increased during as compared to because of higher eft transaction volumes and a corresponding increase in customer reimbursed fees  an increase in ebt processing revenues from contracts that commenced in  and an increase in software revenues and the fees for software related maintenance and support due to our acquisition of an eft software provider in late the following table provides further detail regarding the revenue we generated from our software business during the periods indicated year ended december  in millions license fees maintenance software services we expect our electronic payments segment revenues to improve in as compared to primarily due to higher revenues generated from our eft processing services and software sales 
these increases will be somewhat offset by a decrease in our government services revenues due to contract expirations 
the decline in our electronic payments segment revenues in as compared to was due to the expiration of certain eft processing and government service contracts in late competitive pricing pressures also contributed to the decline in eft processing revenues 
our software license sales also declined  although our acquisition of an eft software company in november of reduced the amount of this decline somewhat 
risk management the growth in the revenues from our risk management segment in as compared to is due to increased revenues from our chexsystems sm products 
this increase was driven by an increase in inquiries associated with new debit account openings and increased utilization rates by our financial institution customers in response to regulatory requirements 
this growth was somewhat offset by a decrease in revenues from our retail check verification products due to pricing concessions and customer attrition caused by declining check volumes 
revenues for this segment are expected to increase in as compared to due to increased revenues from our chexsystems sm suite of products and our retail products 
growth in our retail risk management business should be driven by incremental revenues generated from our acquisition of clearcommerce corporation 
the increase in revenues in this segment in as compared to was also the result of higher chexsystems sm revenues due to inquiry volume growth and an increase in customer screening by financial institutions in response to the requirements of the usa patriot act 
retail check verification revenues were lower in than due to price concessions and customer attrition 
global outsourcing revenues from our global outsourcing segment increased in as compared to due to increased service volumes and the receipt of a full year of revenue from new customer contracts that originated during the latter half of and in we also recorded a shortfall fee during the fourth quarter of from our largest it services customer because the customer failed to reach certain contractually required minimum spending target levels 
this fee somewhat offset a substantial reduction in the it services revenues we received from this customer in as compared to we expect revenues in the global outsourcing segment to improve in as compared to through the expansion of our customer base and the provision of additional services to existing customers 
these increases in revenues are expected to be partially offset by continued declines in our it services revenues 

table of contents lower it services revenues resulted in an overall decline in our global outsourcing business revenue in as compared to bpo revenues in were consistent with revenues in as increases in revenues related to business outsourcing services were offset by a decline in our collection service revenues 
atm management the decline in revenues from the atm management segment in is primarily due to the sale of our atm portfolio in november of and  to a lesser extent  a general decline in transaction volumes as compared to revenues from atm management services are presented in the global outsourcing segment subsequent to the consummation of the atm portfolio sale 
atm management revenues increased in as compared to due to our receipt of a full year of revenue from acquisitions we completed in this segment in as well as from an increase in equipment sales and branding revenues 
business segment margin contributions the following table presents our operating income loss by segment  unallocated corporate expenses and consolidated operating income for the three years ended december  year ended december  change dollars in millions operating income loss electronic payments risk management global outsourcing atm management corporate total operating income represents an increase or decrease in excess of 
amount does not sum due to rounding 
electronic payments the decline in the margins associated with our electronic payments business in as compared to is primarily attributable to an increase in software development and support costs that we experienced last year 
this increase relates to the operational costs associated with the open systems eft software business we acquired in late and our efforts to integrate this software with our legacy software products 
the decline in our electronic payments segment margins in as compared to the prior year is also due to the reversal in of an ebt contract loss reserve which resulted in a non recurring benefit to the segment of approximately million in no such benefit occurred in to the contrary  we recorded a million loss contract charge in the first half of that year 
these declines in margins were partially offset by margin improvements that resulted from processing more eft and ebt transactions using a relatively fixed cost infrastructure 
our operating margins in the electronic payments segment are expected to increase in as compared to because the effect of anticipated increases in our eft processing revenues and software sales should offset the impact of the expected decline in our ebt revenues due to contract expirations 
the decline in the margins of our electronic payments business in as compared to was largely due to pricing concessions associated with contract renewals 
an increase in performance based compensation expense as well as a decline in higher margin software revenues also contributed to the decline in margins 
risk management the improvement in risk management segment margins in as compared to the prior year is due to the increase in revenues from our chexsystems sm suite of products 
this improvement is also attributable to cost reductions realized through increased utilization of our india operations for contact center and development activities 
we expect margins in our risk management segment to improve slightly in as compared to 
table of contents the increase in margins in as compared to was achieved through the elimination of low margin product lines and reducing expenses related to employee and third party service provider costs through cost control initiatives  including the transition of contact center work to our india operations 
additionally  certain restructuring costs and asset impairment charges of approximately million incurred by the segment in were not incurred in global outsourcing an increase in bpo revenues and improved productivity and capacity utilization drove an increase in our global outsourcing segment margins in as compared to this increase in margins was partially offset the decline in it services revenues 
margins for our global outsourcing segment in are expected to increase from due the impact of the gain amortization associated with the master services agreement we signed with the buyer of our atm portfolio 
this impact will be somewhat offset by anticipated declines in the revenues we receive under our largest it services contract 
the decrease in margins in as compared to was attributable to a decline in revenues derived from the provision of it services to our largest customer  pricing concessions on existing contracts and an increase in employee compensation costs 
atm management consistent with our expectations  the margins derived from our atm management segment remained relatively consistent during as compared to the increase in margins in as compared to was primarily due to an improvement in equipment sales margins and the expansion of the atm branding services we provided to our customers 
the operating results of the atm management business are presented in with the global outsourcing segment subsequent to the sale of our atm portfolio in november corporate unallocated corporate overhead includes  among other things  executive leadership costs  investor relations  and certain shared legal  consulting  accounting  finance and technology expenses 
the increase in corporate overhead costs in as compared to is primarily due to an increase in legal and other expenses related to the sec investigation and indemnification obligations associated with its resolution as well as higher expenses associated with and complying with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
corporate overhead costs in are expected to decline from the levels seen in due to the resolution of the sec investigation and ongoing cost reduction efforts 
the decrease in corporate overhead expenses in as compared to is due to the million in severance benefits and lease impairment charges that were incurred in no such charges were incurred in additionally  corporate overhead costs were higher in as compared to due to the additional costs incurred in the latter part of for the transition of executive leadership and the relocation of certain administration functions from wisconsin to arizona 
operating expenses operating expenses for the three years ended december  were as follows year ended december  change dollars in millions operating expenses processing  communication and service costs employee costs depreciation and amortization other operating costs restructuring  asset impairment and other charges contract loss provision reversal total operating expenses represents an increase or decrease in excess of 

table of contents processing  communication and service costs this category includes the cost of transaction processing  telecommunications  computer equipment and promotional services 
this category also included the residual payments we made to the occupants of the properties where the atms that we owned or managed prior to the sale of our atm portfolio were located 
the decrease in processing  communication and service costs in is primarily due to lower residual payments and other atm operational costs due to the sale of our atm portfolio in late additional cost reductions were realized from greater utilization of our india based resources 
this decline in costs was partially offset by an increase in customer reimbursed fees 
processing  communications and service costs are expected to be lower in as compared to due to the sale of the atm portfolio as well as cost reduction initiatives 
during  processing  communication and service costs increased as compared to due to higher atm processing and service expenses associated with a full year of processing for the atm network acquisitions that we completed in these additional costs were partially offset by a decline in third party expenses due to the migration of support services for our risk management business to our india operations as well as a reduction in equipment rental  maintenance and telecommunications costs achieved through contract renegotiations 
employee costs expenses in this category represent employee compensation  payroll taxes  medical costs and other employee related costs 
the increases in these costs in as compared to are attributable to an increase in our performance based compensation costs  including commissions  as well as an increase in employee headcount in our bpo business 
company wide headcount increased to  employees at december  from  employees at december  excluding the impact of acquisitions  employee costs in are expected to decline as compared to due to headcount reductions associated with the atm portfolio sale 
employee costs decreased in as compared to primarily due to reductions in the us employee headcount 
the reduction in employee costs was offset somewhat by higher performance based compensation in as compared to depreciation and amortization these costs represent the depreciation of the buildings and equipment we own and the amortization of our intangible assets  such as capitalized software costs and acquired contracts 
the increase in these costs in as compared to is due to additional depreciation and amortization on assets associated with businesses we acquired during the fourth quarter of and during the first half of this increase was partially offset by a decline in depreciation and amortization expenses due to the cessation of depreciation on the assets included in the atm portfolio following the execution of the related sales agreement in september depreciation and amortization costs in are expected to be consistent with the levels seen in because the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense following the sale of our atm portfolio is expected to be offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense related to assets we acquired during the first half of and the acquisitions we expect will occur in the decrease in depreciation and amortization costs in as compared to is primarily due to a reduction in depreciation expense following the sale of buildings during other operating costs expenditures in this category include facility costs  professional  consulting and temporary services  bad debt expense and certain administrative costs 
other operating costs in remained relatively flat with the corresponding expenses incurred in because the increase in costs from legal and other expenses related to the sec investigation and its resolution and the costs incurred to comply with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act were offset by a reduction in certain facility and insurance costs due to cost reduction efforts 
other operating costs in are expected to decline as compared to due to  among other things  the impact of the gain amortization associated with the master services agreement we signed with the buyer of our atm portfolio  the resolution of the sec investigation in and a reduction in costs related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 

table of contents the increase in other operating costs during as compared to was due to an increase in external consulting costs related to strategic planning efforts and business performance improvement initiatives 
this increase was offset somewhat by reductions in legal and accounting expenses 
restructuring  asset impairment and other charges during  we initiated a significant effort to reduce our cost structure by eliminating unprofitable product lines  improving our internal business processes and increasing the utilization of our india based resources 
these measures resulted in restructuring and asset impairment charges of million in that year 
the charges were comprised of expected severance benefits totaling million for the elimination of approximately positions primarily in the united states  impairment of fixed assets totaling million including a million charge to write down a building in glendale  wisconsin that was held for sale  lease related costs of million related to the consolidation of facilities and a charge of million for software impairment related to products that were discontinued 
during  we reversed million of the lease related charges that we recorded in to reflect the successful subletting of a portion of the properties subject to those leases 
due to the business process improvement initiatives identified during  we recorded restructuring charges for severance benefits of million 
we also recorded a million charge for the write off of in process research and development in connection with our acquisition of a developer of transaction processing software in late we incurred severance charges of approximately million in related to the elimination of approximately positions 
these charges are expected to be paid through we continue to explore opportunities to reduce costs as part of our ongoing business improvement initiatives 
contract loss provision reversal we recorded a million loss contact charge for certain long term software contracts during the second quarter of these are fixed price contracts that require us to make significant modifications to the underlying software and increases in the scope of these projects resulted in unanticipated increases in the expense required to complete these modifications 
as a result  we now expect to incur losses in their performance 
in  we recorded a million benefit related to a reduction in our estimate of future losses on certain government ebt contracts 
a similar net benefit of million was taken in the third quarter of actual results on these government ebt contracts have been better than previously estimated due to higher than expected case counts and savings on costs such as telecommunications 
the government service contracts for which the loss reserve was established are approaching their expiration dates and  accordingly  our ability to accurately estimate the required balance of the loss contract reserve has been improving 
at december  the balance of the contract loss reserve for the software and government ebt contracts was approximately million 
other expense income net other expense income net primarily includes interest and investment income  interest and investment expense and foreign currency translation adjustments 
interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments was million in  million in and million in we incurred an expense in as compared to income in from unfavorable changes in foreign currency rates  primarily attributable to changes in the exchange rate between the india rupee and the us dollar 
we are considering whether to enter into a hedging arrangement to limit our exposure to unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations 
provision for income taxes the annualized effective tax rates for  and were  and  respectively 
the lower effective tax rate in relative to and reflects the benefit of certain permanent deductions taken by the company in  some of which related to prior tax years 
we expect our annualized effective tax rate to approximate in although the actual rate incurred may vary significantly 
our effective tax rate is largely determined by our india subsidiary s proportional share of our projected consolidated income 
our india software development and business process outsourcing operations qualify for tax incentives associated with businesses that operate within designated geographic locations within india 
these incentives generally provide us with exemptions from india income tax on certain business income generated from these operations and phase out through march the effect of these tax incentives was to reduce our income tax expense by approximately million in  million in and million in 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview information about our financial position as of december  and is presented below dollars in millions change cash and cash equivalents short term investments long term debt due within one year long term debt stockholders equity net working capital represents an increase or decrease in excess of 
cash resources in  our beginning cash balance and cash provided from operations are expected to be sufficient to meet our recurring operating commitments and to fund planned capital expenditures  share repurchases and acquisitions 
cash and cash equivalents at december  included cash in india of approximately million 
the funds in india are held in india bank accounts denominated in india rupees or us dollars 
these funds are available for use in our india operations and investments 
under the american jobs creation act of the act  we have the opportunity to receive a special one time tax deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings during although we are still assessing the repatriation provisions of the act  we do not currently anticipate repatriating funds from india during as part of our transaction processing business  we provide cash settlement services to financial institutions and state and local governments 
these services involve the movement of funds between the various parties associated with an atm  point of sale or ebt transaction and this activity results in a balance due to us at the end of each business day that we recoup over the next few business days 
the balances due us are included in cash on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   approximately million of settlement payments were due to us and we received these funds in early january we are required to maintain sufficient available cash to fund the daily settlement advances we make against the payments we receive through the settlement process 
the typical overnight settlement balance due to us ranges from million to million 
we also seek to maintain approximately million available to ensure that we can advance funds to our processing customers if unusual circumstances prevent us from timely processing their settlement files 
we plan to satisfy these liquidity requirements using the cash and cash equivalents we have on hand as well as through the credit agreement described below 
on february   we entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement with a syndicate of banks 
the credit agreement provides for an initial aggregate commitment under an unsecured revolving credit facility of million 
we have the option to increase this commitment to million if certain requirements of the credit agreement are satisfied 
we may use amounts borrowed under the credit agreement to finance permitted acquisitions and related expenses  working capital needs and other general corporate purposes 
the credit agreement provides for two optional interest rates on any borrowings thereunder 
the first rate is equal to the greater of the prime rate as defined or the federal funds effective rate plus depending on certain conditions set forth in the credit agreement 
the second rate is equal to the london interbank offering rate multiplied by the statutory reserve rate plus an additional percentage based on our leverage ratio 
the terms of the agreement include certain defined negative and affirmative covenants customary for facilities of this type 
the credit agreement will mature in and  upon the lenders approval  we may receive two one year extensions of the maturity date 
on february   we announced that our board of directors had approved a plan to buy back up to million of our common stock at prices not to exceed per share over an estimated six to month period beginning during the first quarter of the repurchases will be made using our available cash 
we will be making purchases in the open market  and through negotiated arrangements and block transactions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations 
we have no present intention of using our available funds to pay cash dividends 

table of contents the following table sets forth our contractual cash obligations as of december  in total and for the time periods specified 
our long term debt consists principally of capital lease obligations related to purchased software and equipment 
payments due by period in millions total thereafter capital lease obligations operating lease obligations vendor obligations total future minimum lease payments for non cancelable operating leases are presented net of minimum sublease rentals of million due in the future under non cancelable subleases 
purchase orders for goods and services are not included in this table 
our purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements and are based upon current service needs 
purchase orders are generally fulfilled by our vendors within one or two months 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchases of services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  such as fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction 
we are party to certain other contracts with third parties whereby the third party provides services to us 
these services are operational in nature and our obligations under these contracts vary from period to period based on our utilization of these services 
these commitments are not reflected in the table above as the associated amounts are not currently determinable 
sources and uses of cash the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flow activity for the three years ended december  and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated statements of cash flows summary of cash flows year ended december  in millions cash provided by operating activities cash provided by used in investing activities cash provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents our current priorities for use of our cash are investment in projects intended to increase our product delivery and operational effectiveness  enhance our product suite and the redundancy of our systems  funding our liquidity needs  complementary acquisitions  and executing our share repurchase plan 
operating activities our primary source of operating cash flow is the profits we generate from our business 
operating cash outflows include payments to vendors for telecommunications services  consulting services and supplies 
we also pay salaries and benefits to our employees and income taxes 
cash flows from operations decreased to million in as compared to million in although our business generated more gross profits in  this higher profitability was offset by the impact from the payment of approximately million of performance bonuses in we did not pay incentive bonuses in additionally  the cash flow from our operations was reduced by an increase in our accounts receivable balance due to an increase in our international operations  which have historically had a longer collection cycle 
we expect to pay approximately million in income taxes in primarily related to the sale of the atm portfolio 
this payment is expected to offset the cash flow increase generated from the improved operating results we anticipate in and so we believe operating cash flows in will be consistent with the levels achieved in 
table of contents the cash we earned from operating activities was approximately the same for and the benefit from the elimination of incentive payments in as compared to was offset somewhat by a decrease in our accounts payable  primarily as a result of the migration from the use of vendors for outside services to the utilization of our employee workforce in india and from a general reduction in expenses overall 
investing activities cash provided by or used in our investing activities generally includes cash effects from the sale or acquisition of assets 
in  we generated approximately million from the sale of our atm portfolio and the execution of the related master services agreement with the buyer 
we used approximately million for capital expenditures  approximately million to purchase short term investments and approximately million for the acquisition of penley  inc and loss control solutions 
we expect to acquire additional complementary businesses in and  although we cannot predict the amount we will spend on this activity with a great degree of certainty  we would generally expect to expend between million in this regard 
we also expect our capital expenditures to increase to approximately million in primarily as a result of the continued re architecture of our technical infrastructure and product development activities 
during we used approximately million to purchase short term investments  million to acquire an open systems software company and approximately million to purchase fixed assets and develop software 
these expenditures were offset by approximately million in proceeds we received from the sale of buildings that were classified as held for sale at december  acquisitions resulted in the cash outflows of approximately million in and capital expenditures accounted for million of cash used in investing activities in that year 
financing activities we receive funds from the exercise of stock options and the sale of our shares through our employee stock purchase plan 
financing outflows generally include the repayment of capital lease obligations 
in  we received approximately million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the sale of shares through our employee stock purchase plan and we used approximately million to pay down capital leases 
we expect to spend approximately million to repurchase shares of our common stock during  although the specific timing and amount of repurchases will vary based on market conditions  securities law limitations and other factors 
in  we received approximately million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the sale of shares through our employee stock purchase plan and we used approximately million to repay capital lease obligations 
proceeds from exercise of stock options and the sale of shares through our employee stock purchase plan was approximately million in offset by approximately million of cash outflows for the repayment of capital leases 
impact from atm portfolio sale the sale of our atm portfolio and the execution of the related master services agreement in november resulted in cash inflows of approximately million which has been classified as cash flows received from investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
the sale of the atm portfolio also eliminated our guarantees on certain equipment lease payments for canadian customers serviced in connection with this business and the termination of the vault cash agreements we had with the financial institutions that provided cash to certain of the atms that were previously owned or managed by us 
future cash flows from operations are not expected to be significantly impacted by the sale of the atm portfolio because the operating cash flow generated by the managed services agreement is expected to approximate the operating cash flows previously generated by our atm business 
cash flows from investing and financing activities are also not expected to be materially impacted in future periods from the sale of the atm portfolio 
future commercial commitments the following table sets forth our future commercial commitments as of december  commitment expiration by period in millions total thereafter letters of credit and other performance bonds total commitments 
table of contents we use cash collateral to secure letters of credit we issue in the ordinary course of business 
we had million in letters of credit outstanding at december   mostly related to leases 
these letters of credit were secured by million in cash collateral 
in addition  we have obtained million of bank guarantees in india related to our performance of a customer contract and certain obligations related to local government requirements 
these guarantees are collateralized by million of time deposits at the banks issuing the guarantees 
in connection with our government services business  collection and atm management activities  we post surety bonds with state agencies guaranteeing our performance of certain obligations related to the relevant contracts or state requirements 
the aggregate amount of such bonds outstanding at december  was million 
critical accounting policies and estimates the foregoing discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  intangible assets  reserves and allowances  income taxes and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our net revenues consist of fees for transaction processing and related services  risk management  software and data licensing  maintenance and support  government benefit distribution  business process outsourcing and information technology consulting services 
revenue arrangements entered into subsequent to june  with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting 
a delivered item is considered a separate unit of accounting if the item has value to the customer on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item and delivery of the item is considered probable and substantially in our control if a general right of return on the delivered unit exists 
the total consideration associated with the arrangement is allocated among each of the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values if determinable or using a residual method if only the fair value of the undelivered item exists 
the applicable revenue recognition criteria is considered separately for each unit of accounting 
our revenue recognition policies for the various types of fees our business receives are as follows transaction processing and service fees are recognized in the period that the service is rendered 
these services consist of processing our customers electronic debit transactions and settling the funds with the financial institutions involved in the transactions 
transaction processing and service fees are charged on a per transaction basis  depending on the contractual arrangement with the customer 
government services fees are recognized in the period services are rendered based on monthly fees per benefits recipient 
in connection with the provision of services in the atm management services segment  we earned surcharge and interchange fees as the primary service provider 
surcharge fees are the familiar fees the user of an atm pays at the time of a transaction 
interchange fees are paid by that user s financial institution 
we assumed the credit risk associated with collection of these fees 
generally  our arrangements called for us to pay a fee to the occupants of the property at which the atm was physically located 
the amount of this fee typically had some relationship to the surcharge and interchange fees that were collected by us on individual transactions 
based upon the underlying contractual provisions associated with our arrangements  we recorded the surcharge and interchange fees that we collected at their gross amounts as revenue and the residual payments to the occupant of the property at which the atm was physically located as a processing  communication and service cost 
effective as of the date of the sale of our atm portfolio  our atm management services business is longer reported as a separate operating segment 
following this sale  we no longer provide services that earn surcharge or interchange fees 

table of contents risk management fees are recognized as revenue in the period the services are rendered 
risk management services consist of new account applicant and check verification screenings to manage the risk associated with account openings and check acceptance 
risk management fees are based on the number of inquiries against the databases used for screening purposes or monthly fees based on the net monthly sales of the retailer using our check verification products or other similar measures  depending on the product and service 
we provide business process outsourcing and information technology consulting services 
revenue from providing these services is generally recognized under one of two methods  depending on the relevant contractual terms 
under the time and materials method  which is applied to a significant portion of our professional services contracts  revenue is based on a fee per hour basis and is recognized as hours are completed 
under the fixed contract method  which represents an insignificant portion of our revenues  a pre set fee is agreed upon for a project and revenue is recognized proportionately to the percentage of completion of the project 
if the information technology consulting services involve the significant modification  customization or production of the software that has been licensed from us  the license fee and related service fees are also recognized proportionately to the percentage of completion of the project 
service contracts in which the fees are recognized proportionately to the percentage of completion of the project typically use the expended method for measuring progress toward completion of the project 
this method typically measures progress toward completion using the number of labor hours or days incurred compared to the total estimated number of hours or days required to complete the project 
this method relies on estimates of the total effort necessary to complete the project and these estimates are subject to revision as the projects progress towards completion 
revisions to these estimates that result in a material impact to our results of operations or financial position are recorded in the periods in which we determine that a revision is probable and subject to reasonable estimation 
a material increase in efforts to complete the project will result in a reduction in that project s profit 
software and data license fees for standard products are recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists  the license fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility of the license fee is probable and delivery has occurred 
if a license contains customer acceptance criteria for which significant uncertainties exist  the revenue is recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the satisfaction of the customer acceptance criteria 
certain software products include multiple modules and the license fee charged to the customer is based on the modules licensed 
if a customer contract requires that we deliver multiple elements  then upfront fees related to the delivered element may be recognized as revenue if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for each of the undelivered elements 
in these instances  the total fair value of the undelivered elements  based on vendor specific objective evidence  is recorded as deferred revenue 
the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount recorded as deferred revenue is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements 
if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist  then the total fees of the arrangement are recognized ratably over the entire term of the underlying agreement 
software maintenance and support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract or as the services are rendered 
the process involved in evaluating the appropriateness of revenue recognition involves judgments about the sufficiency of the evidence regarding the fair value of each of the various elements required to be delivered in a sale that has multiple components  the collectibility of our fees and the costs required to complete projects for our customers 
disposition of atm portfolio on november   we consummated an agreement the agreement to sell the atm portfolio associated with our atm management segment 
concurrently with the consummation of the sale of the atm portfolio  we entered into a five year atm master services agreement msa with the buyer 
pursuant to the msa  we are providing the buyer with transaction processing  residual administration  cash and telecommunications management  help desk and other atm management services 
the atm portfolio represented a significant portion of the atm management segment and we ceased presenting this business as a separate operating segment following the atm portfolio sale 
the services provided in accordance with the msa are presented within our remaining segments with processing service revenues and related costs being recorded within the electronic payments segment and revenues from atm management services  and related costs reported within the global outsourcing segment 
the operating results of the atm portfolio have not been presented as discontinued operations because we have significant continuing involvement in the operations of the asset group through the msa 
the major asset categories and related carrying amounts sold and disposed of included net accounts receivable of million  net property and equipment of 
table of contents million  goodwill of approximately million  net other intangible assets of approximately million  other current assets of approximately million and accounts payable and other current liabilities of approximately million 
we incurred approximately million of costs in connection with the transaction that primarily consisted of professional service fees 
the amounts received by us in connection with the agreement exceeded the book value of the atm portfolio by approximately million 
in considering the appropriate method for accounting for the excess proceeds from this arrangement  we considered the analogous authoritative literature 
the most directly applicable pronouncement was considered to be emerging issues task force eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf indicates that in arrangements with multiple elements that are deemed to be in substance one arrangement  any income or gain associated with the arrangement should be deferred and recognized over the period of the remaining obligations unless there is sufficient  objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered contractual elements 
we consider the atm portfolio sale and the msa to be components of a single arrangement because these transactions were negotiated simultaneously without regard to their individual economic characteristics 
although both factual and anecdotal evidence was considered  we were unable to determine the fair value of the msa with a reasonable degree of certainty due to  among other things  the uniqueness of that contract  the lack of similar arrangements in the industry and because the contractual cash flows expected to be generated by the msa are not representative of the contract s intrinsic fair value absent the compensating benefits associated with the entirety of the arrangement represented by the atm portfolio sale and the msa 
due to the lack of sufficient  objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the msa  we determined that the only appropriate method of accounting for the arrangement was to defer the entirety of the implied gain from the transactions and amortize this amount as a reduction in the other operating costs of our global outsourcing segment over the period of the remaining undelivered elements of the obligations of the arrangement the initial five year term of the msa 
at december   approximately million of the implied gain was recorded as a deferred gain of which million was recorded as current liabilities and the remainder is included in long term liabilities 
the long term deferred gain will be amortized beginning in and continuing through the expiration of the msa 
however  in the event the msa is terminated early and our services thereunder are discontinued  the entire unamortized deferred gain would be recognized 
we have modified our prior approach to accounting for this agreement and we will not be recognizing any revenues as a result of this amortization in future periods 
intangible assets our intangible assets consist primarily of capitalized software costs  acquired contracts and goodwill 
software internal use we capitalize the cost of software developed or obtained for internal use once the preliminary project stage has been completed  management commits to funding the project  it is probable that the project will be completed and that the software will be used to perform the function intended 
capitalized costs include only external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use software  payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to the internal use software project and interest costs incurred  when material  while developing internal use software 
capitalization of costs ceases when the project is substantially complete and the software is ready for its intended use 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  we assess internal use software for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recovered 
for example  in we discontinued certain product lines which resulted in a charge of approximately million for the impairment of the related software 
there have been no subsequent impairment charges for internal use software 
software licensing and resale we capitalize the cost of software developed for licensing and resale once technological feasibility has been established 
costs incurred prior to establishing technological feasibility are expensed as incurred 
technological feasibility is established when we have completed all planning  designing  coding and testing activities that are necessary to determine that a product can be produced to meet its design specifications 
capitalization of costs ceases when the product is available for general release to customers 
such costs are amortized on a product by product basis normally over three years and no longer than five years 
software developed for resale is carried at the lesser of amortized cost or net realizable value 
although we have never recorded an impairment charge for software developed for resale  these capitalized costs could be impaired if the net realizable value of that software became less than its net book value 
such an impairment could occur if our sales of that software declined significantly 
acquired contracts and other contracts acquired through acquisitions are specifically identified in connection with that acquisition 
the amount recorded as intangible assets in respect of acquired contracts represents the estimated fair value of these relationships 
this estimate is 
table of contents based on the present value of the estimated future net cash flows from the contracts  including expected renewals 
the majority of these intangibles are amortized on an accelerated method that is intended to mirror the cash flow patterns used in estimating the value of the acquired contract 
where appropriate  we use third party valuation professionals to assist us in determining the fair value and amortizable life of contracts at the time of their acquisition 
this type of intangible asset could be impaired if the attrition rate associated with the acquired contracts materially exceeds the rate used to estimate the fair value of the acquired contract portfolio 
to date  we have not incurred any significant impairments with regard to our acquired contracts 
other intangibles also include other assets obtained in connection with the acquisition of other companies  typically non competition agreements 
non competition agreements are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition and amortized ratably over the period of the non competition agreement 
we assess acquired contracts and other intangible assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill when we acquire other companies  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america require that we make estimates regarding the fair value of the acquired company s tangible assets and liabilities and its identifiable intangible assets 
based upon these estimates  we then allocate the purchase price to the assets and liabilities of the acquired company for the purpose of recording these items in our financial records 
any unallocated portion of the purchase price is recorded as goodwill 
the distinction between the amount of the purchase price allocated either to tangible assets and liabilities or identifiable intangible assets and goodwill is significant because goodwill is not amortized to our income statements but is instead subject to an annual impairment test 
estimates inherent in the process of this purchase price allocation include assumptions regarding the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows  the salability of inventories  selection of discount rates  contract renewal rates and general market conditions 
where appropriate  we use third party valuation professionals to assist us in making these estimates 
we perform an annual review in the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment  to determine if the goodwill we have recorded in respect of our reporting segments is impaired 
if changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment of our recorded goodwill  we compare the fair value of the segment to its carrying value  including its associated goodwill 
the carrying value of the segment includes an allocation of those corporate assets and liabilities that have not been specifically identified with the segment  based upon its pro rata percentage of our total net revenue 
we primarily rely on the income method to determine a segment s fair value 
this valuation approach uses estimates of the segment s future revenue and costs and a discount rate based upon the estimated weighted average cost of capital for that segment 
our estimates of a segment s future cash flows are based upon historical data  various internal estimates and external sources 
we develop these estimates as part of our routine long term strategic planning 
we test the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying our discounted cash flow analysis by the available and comparable market data 
we have not recorded an impairment in the goodwill of our segments in the past 
reserves and allowances loss contract reserve we maintain a reserve for expected future losses on certain of our long term service contracts 
our estimates of these losses are based on our best estimate of the contract s revenue and costs 
our established contract loss reserves relate to certain of our government service contracts and software development agreements 
we use a variety of assumptions to estimate any future losses on our government services contracts  including assumptions about future welfare case levels  the number of transactions per case and the costs related to processing transactions and providing support services 
for our software service contracts  our assumptions include among other things estimated costs and hours or days to complete the development project 
these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties and actual results may differ from our estimates 
in the event such differences arise  a revision to the loss contract reserve would be required 
any such revision could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
actual losses on individual long term service contracts are compared with loss projections periodically  with any changes in the estimated total contract loss recognized as they become probable and reasonably estimable 
we could record additional losses or record a reversal of the loss provision in the event that actual and projected revenues and expenses do not track with our original estimates 
although the timing of any additional provisions for contract losses and reversals of provisions for contract losses is not related to the contract s life  our ability to more precisely estimate the future performance of any given contract improves as the remaining term of that contract shortens 
changes in estimates that could result in the need for additional losses could include lower than anticipated case levels and transactions per case for our government service long term contracts or higher than expected 
table of contents hours or days to complete our software service contracts 
during and  we recorded a reversal of our loss contracts provision of million and million  respectively  for our government service contracts as a result of higher than originally estimated case levels as well as lower than expected costs of supporting the contracts 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our estimates of how often our customers will fail to make their required payments 
we develop this allowance based on our experience with specific customers  our understanding of their current economic circumstances and our own judgment as to the likelihood of their ultimate payment 
we also consider our collection experience with the balance of our receivables portfolio and make estimates regarding collectibility based on trends in aging 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  thereby impairing their ability to make payments  an increase in this allowance could be required in a future period 
such an increase would reduce our income 
income taxes accounting for income taxes requires us to make significant judgments in estimating our future income taxes 
these judgments include  but are not limited to  the likelihood we will realize the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards  the adequacy of our valuation allowances  the rates to be used to measure transactions with foreign subsidiaries and the valuation models to be used for measuring the value of certain transactions 
further  our operations are governed by and subject to government regulations in the united states and in foreign countries in which we operate  including laws and regulations relating to taxation and the judgments and estimates we use are subject to challenge by domestic and foreign taxing authorities 
we recognize tax liabilities at the time that they are judged to be probable of being incurred and can be reasonably estimated 
it is possible that either foreign or domestic taxing authorities could challenge our judgments and estimates and draw conclusions that would cause us to incur tax liabilities in excess of those currently recorded 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
although we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such a determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such a determination was made 
we consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be permanently invested and  accordingly  we have not provided for us federal  state income or applicable foreign withholding taxes on those amounts 
undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately million at december  absent the effect of the american jobs creation act of  upon any distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise  we would be subject to both us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and applicable withholding taxes payable to the foreign countries 
the act provides us with the opportunity to receive a special one time tax deduction on the repatriation of certain of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries during although we are still assessing the repatriation provisions of the act  we do not currently anticipate repatriating funds from india during stock based compensation we issue stock options to our employees under the terms of the efunds corporation stock option plan 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap provide two alternative methods of accounting for stock options issued under the terms and conditions that we typically issue them 
one alternative is to estimate the fair value of the stock option at the date of grant and amortize that value as an expense to operations over the contractual vesting period 
the other option currently available to companies reporting under gaap is to estimate the fair value of the option at the grant date  but only reflect the impact of the amortization in a footnote to the financial statements and to forgo adjusting the statement of operations 
the method a company chooses to apply is a matter of policy 
consistent with our past practices  we currently utilize the second of these options and we reflect the impact of option amortization in the footnotes to our financial statements 
as illustrated in note to the financial statements  were we to change our accounting policy on this matter to reflect option expense in our statements of income  our results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
the financial accounting standards board fasb recently revised the current applicable accounting pronouncements related to accounting for stock options to require us to reflect our option expense in our statements of income no later than the third quarter of see the discussion below regarding sfas no 
r under recent accounting pronouncements 
the amount of stock based compensation expense we recognize would change if the underlying assumptions used to estimate this 
table of contents expense were to change 
for instance  we would expect the expense to decrease if the expected life of the option or the volatility of our stock price were to decrease 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb revised sfas no 
 share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r replaces sfas no 
and  although the two pronouncements are similar in most respects  a key difference among the pronouncements  is that sfas no 
r generally requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services rendered in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
sfas no 
r is effective as of the beginning of the first interim reporting period that begins after june  and may be adopted earlier 
we did not adopt sfas no 
r as of december  and as a result  sfas no 
r has not affected our consolidated financial position or results of operations to date 
the adoption of sfas no 
r will result in an increase in our employee costs 
we have not yet determined which option valuation approach we will use to estimate the fair value of our stock option grants and so we cannot precisely estimate the amount of this increase at this time 
in december  the fasb issued staff position no 
fas  application of fasb statement  accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of and staff position no 
fas  accounting and disclosure for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of collectively  the provisions 
the provisions were issued in response to certain issues surrounding the act 
the act provides certain domestic companies a temporary opportunity to repatriate previously undistributed earnings of controlled foreign subsidiaries at a reduced federal tax rate  approximating 
the reduced rate is achieved via an dividends received deduction on earnings repatriated during a one year period 
the provisions address the appropriate treatment of this tax deduction and related accounting and disclosure requirements 
although we are still assessing the repatriation provisions of the act  we do not currently anticipate repatriating funds from india during in september  the eitf reached a consensus regarding issue no 
 accounting for preexisting relationships between the parties to a business combination eitf 
eitf requires an acquirer in a business combination to evaluate any preexisting relationship with the acquiree to determine if the business combination in effect contains a settlement of the preexisting relationship 
a business combination between parties with a preexisting relationship should be viewed as a multiple element transaction 
eitf is effective for business combinations after october   but requires goodwill resulting from prior business combinations involving parties with a preexisting relationship to be tested for impairment by applying the guidance in the consensus 
we will apply eitf to acquisitions subsequent to the effective date and in our future goodwill impairment testing

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
we operate internationally and are subject to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
these exposures may change over time as our business evolves and could have an adverse or positive impact on our financial results 
we have not entered into any derivative instruments or hedging contracts to reduce our exposure to adverse foreign currency rate or interest rate changes  although we may do so in the future 
currently  we receive non us dollar denominated revenues and incur non us dollar denominated operating expenses primarily in the united kingdom  india and canada 
we also have assets located in these countries 
the principal currencies creating foreign exchange rate risk for us are the british pound  india rupee and canadian dollar 
for the year ended december   approximately of our net revenues and of our operating expenses were denominated in these three currencies 
we have prepared sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency rates on our income before tax for the year ended december  based upon these analyses  we estimate that a adverse change in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the british pound  india rupee and canadian dollar would have reduced our reported income before taxes during by approximately million 
a change in the exchange rate for the british pound  india rupee and canadian dollar would also have an impact on the foreign net assets reflected in our balance sheet  but we would not expect this change to be material to our total assets 
changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated interest income on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments
