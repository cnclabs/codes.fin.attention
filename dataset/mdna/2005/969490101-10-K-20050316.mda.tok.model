item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to provide information relevant to an understanding of our financial condition  changes in our financial condition and our results of operations and cash flows and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are an oil and gas exploration company 
our basic business model is to find oil and gas reserves through exploration activities  and sell the production from those reserves at a profit 
to be successful  we must  over time  be able to find oil and gas reserves and then sell our discovered production at a price that is sufficient to cover our finding costs  operating expenses  administrative costs and interest expense  plus offer us a return on our capital investment 
we believe that the economic climate in the domestic oil and gas industry continues to be suitable for our business model 
oil and gas prices have remained strong 
supply and demand fundamentals continue to suggest that energy prices will remain high for the near term  providing us with the economic incentives necessary for us to assume the risks we face in our search for oil and gas reserves 
finding quality domestic oil and gas reserves through exploration is a significant challenge and involves a high degree of risk 
although our exploration results improved significantly from  our drilling success over the past three years has been limited  and we have not found sufficient reserves to replace our production through exploration activities 
in order to grow our reserve base through our exploration program  we need to continue to improve our drilling success 
we will also continue to look for opportunities to complement our exploration program through the purchase of proved reserves as we did in with the acquisition of swr 
key factors to consider the following summarizes the key factors considered by management in the review of our financial condition and operating performance for and the outlook for in may  we completed the acquisition of swr 
exploration costs related to abandonments and impairments totaled million for  most of which was in louisiana and the black warrior basin of mississippi 
we recorded a loss of million for related to the change in fair value of derivatives 
cash settlements to counterparties accounted for million of this loss  and changes in mark to market valuations accounted for million 
since we do not presently designate our derivatives as cash flow hedges under applicable accounting standards  we recognize the full effect of changing prices on mark to market valuations as a current charge or credit to results of operations 
our proved oil and gas reserves at december  increased to bcfe 
the swr acquisition added bcfe  extensions and discoveries added bcfe  and net revisions added another bcfe 
we currently plan to spend million in on exploration and development activities  of which approximately relates to exploratory prospects 
although recent discoveries in louisiana accounted for bcfe of proved reserve additions in  this area also accounted for million of the million in abandonment and impairment charges for approximately of our planned expenditures in are projected to be spent on louisiana prospects 
our oil and gas production for totaled bcfe  lower than production 
excluding any production we may derive from our exploratory drilling activities  we currently estimate that production will be relatively flat compared to production levels 
acquisition of southwest royalties  inc on may   we acquired all the outstanding common stock of swr through a merger 
prior to the acquisition  swr was a privately held  midland based energy company engaged in oil and gas exploration  production  development and acquisition activities in the united states 
most of swr s properties are located in the permian basin 
using reserve guidelines established by the sec  the swr acquisition added approximately bcfe to our proved oil and gas reserves on the effective date of the acquisition 
in connection with the acquisition  we paid million to holders of swr common stock and common stock warrants and assumed and refinanced approximately million of swr bank debt at closing 
in addition  we incurred approximately million of merger related costs  including i the assumption of swr s obligations to its officers and employees pursuant to change of control arrangements and ii investment banking  legal  accounting and other direct transaction costs related to the acquisition 
recent exploration and developmental activities louisiana approximately half of the net wells commenced in louisiana in were completed as producers 
in addition  approximately of the extensions and discoveries of proved oil and gas reserves during were derived from south louisiana prospects 
despite these favorable results  our abandonment and impairment costs from south louisiana prospects totaled million due primarily to high costs on three wells 
the state lease fleur well was ultimately completed as a producer in a shallower zone after attempts to complete the well in a deeper zone were unsuccessful 
as a result  we recorded an abandonment charge of approximately million for costs incurred in the abandoned portion of the well 
the mervine jankower bosco and the mcilhenny tabasco were high cost exploratory wells that were determined to be dry  resulting in combined abandonment charges of million 
to date  we have drilled  or participated in drilling  gross net wells in south louisiana  of which gross net wells were productive 
although our success rate from inception of this program is lower than we had expected  our success rate of approximately is encouraging 
we have tried several strategies for improving our exploration results in south louisiana  where the geology is very complex  but the results have been mixed and often inconclusive 
similar to our approach in  our current strategy is a moderate approach through which we attempt to balance our exploration efforts between prospects with large  deep structures and those with shallower structures 
we carefully consider the geological characteristics of each prospect in making our final determination of its risk profile 
in some cases  we may elect to reduce our risks associated with drilling the deeper  more expensive prospects by selling a portion of these prospects to industry partners 
we currently plan to spend million in louisiana in to generate and lease new exploratory prospects and to drill existing exploratory prospects 
previous drilling results are not necessarily indicative of future results 
actual results may be better or worse than our track record in this area 
all of the planned expenditures in this area are considered to be high risk 
black warrior basin in we began an exploration program in the southern portion of the black warrior basin in mississippi targeting the stones river formation 
based on our evaluation of approximately  miles of d seismic data  we engaged in a significant lease play in which we acquired more than  net acres 
to date  we have drilled three wells in this area  all of which were unsuccessful 
the weyerhaeuser and the mississippi state university were both drilled to the stones river formation and also tested several pennsylvanian aged sands at a shallower depth 
the inez west well  which began drilling in january  was drilled exclusively to test the pennsylvanian sands 
we recorded abandonment and impairment charges totaling million in and will expense approximately million in additional abandonment costs in the first quarter of we continue to carry approximately million of unimpaired acreage costs attributable to one prospect in the black warrior basin that we believe is prospective for production from the pennsylvanian sands 
permian basin the acquisition of swr in has provided us with several developmental drilling opportunities in the permian basin of west texas and southeast new mexico 
we currently plan to spend million in the permian basin in to acquire acreage and drill wells 
most of the wells we plan to drill in this area will be developmental wells  which generally involve a lower success risk than exploratory wells 
we believe that the longer life reserves typically associated with permian basin production  plus the lower risk profile  will complement our more aggressive exploration program 
other we are currently attempting to complete the catherine destefano  a  foot exploratory well in robertson county  texas targeting the knowles formation 
this structure was identified by d seismic in connection with our exploration program in the cotton valley reef complex area 
we began drilling this well in august  and to date  we have incurred drilling and completion costs totaling million  of which million was incurred in we cannot presently determine if this well will be commercially productive 
if this well is ultimately determined to be nonproductive  we will charge to expense all cumulative drilling and completion costs during the period such determination is made 
in addition  we currently plan to spend million in to explore for oil and gas in other areas  including south and east texas  utah  montana  and colorado 
proved oil and gas reserves our proved oil and gas reserves increased to bcfe at december  from bcfe at december  the pre tax present value of estimated future net revenues from these reserves  discounted at and computed in accordance with sec guidelines  totaled million at december   as compared to million at december  the estimates were based on weighted average oil and ngl prices of per bbl in  as compared to in  and gas prices of per mcf in  as compared to per mcf in the following table summarizes changes in our proved reserves during on a bcfe basis 
bcfe total proved reserves  december  purchases of reserves in place extensions and discoveries revisions of previous estimates sales of reserves in place production total proved reserves  december  during  we replaced of the bcfe that we produced in  computed by dividing the sum of all reserve additions purchases of reserves in place  extensions and discoveries  and revisions in previous estimates by production 
we use this reserve replacement ratio as a benchmark for determining the sources through which we have expanded or contracted our base of proved reserves 
following is a discussion of the important factors related to each source of reserve additions during purchases of reserves in place 
all of the purchased reserves in were derived from the acquisition of swr 
of the bcfe acquired  bcfe were classified as proved developed reserves 
the remaining bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves will require the expenditure of approximately million over the next years before the reserves can ultimately be converted to cash flow 
although we are continually looking for acquisitions  we cannot predict the likelihood of adding any reserves in through purchases of reserves in place 
extensions and discoveries 
our extensions and discoveries during consist primarily of bcfe of proved reserves attributable directly to the drilling of discovery wells during the year and bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves added during the year  primarily in the austin chalk trend and permian basin  that are associated with drilling locations which we believe are now feasible to drill under current economic conditions 
proved undeveloped reserves added through this source will require the expenditure of approximately million over the next years before the reserves can ultimately be converted to cash flow 
due to the nature of exploratory drilling  we cannot predict the extent to which we will add any reserves in through extensions and discoveries 
revisions of previous estimates 
of the bcfe of proved reserves added through revisions of previous estimates  approximately was attributable to improved well performance  primarily from properties acquired in the swr merger 
the remainder was attributable to the effects of higher product prices on the estimated quantities of proved reserves 
most of this increase was applicable to properties that are currently contributing to our cash flow 
this source is subject to volatility due to well performance and product prices and can generate both upward revisions and downward revisions 
as we discuss under known trends and uncertainties elsewhere in this item  reserve estimates are inherently imprecise 
proved undeveloped reserves are generally the least accurate due to limitations on available information 
this increases the risk that the reserve additions in that are classified as proved undeveloped reserves could be subject to downward revisions in the future as economic conditions change and as more information is obtained through drilling 
the sales of reserves in place were attributable to the jo mill unit in borden county  texas and the romere pass unit in plaquemines parish  louisiana 
supplemental information the following unaudited information is intended to supplement the consolidated financial statements included in this form k with data that is not readily available from those statements

average daily production for swr on an annualized basis for was  mcf of gas and  barrels of oil based on days of production 
includes a million impairment of unproved acreage in the black warrior basin in and million in excludes wells being drilled or completed at the end of each period 
operating results the following discussion compares our results for the year ended december  to the two previous years 
all references to  and within this section refer to the respective annual periods 
oil and gas operating results our oil and gas sales reached a record high again in  exceeding the previous record in oil prices continued to climb to record levels  and gas prices remained favorable 
comparing to  oil and gas sales increased million  of which price variances accounted for a million increase and production variances accounted for a million decrease 
comparing to  oil and gas sales increased million  of which price variances accounted for a million increase and production variances accounted for a million increase 
production in on an mcfe basis was lower than and higher than we increased our oil production in due primarily to the acquisition of swr in may and production from two new wells in louisiana 
our gas production was lower in than due primarily to normal production declines in the cotton valley reef complex area and in louisiana  offset in part by additional gas production from the swr acquisition 
in  our realized gas price was higher than and higher than  while our realized oil price was higher than and higher than historically  the markets for oil and gas have been volatile  and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
we have very little control over the prices we receive for our production at the wellhead since most of our physical marketing arrangements are market sensitive 
looking forward  excluding any new production from our exploration program or from acquisitions of proved reserves  oil and gas production for should remain relatively constant with levels 
we plan to spend million in to explore for new oil and gas production 
through these exploration efforts  we believe we can add sufficient volumes of new production to replace our production 
if we do not replace our production  oil and gas sales after may decline 
we cannot predict with accuracy future prices for oil and gas although currently we believe the fundamentals are in place for a continued strong oil and gas commodities market 
however  we have not designated our current commodity derivatives  and do not currently intend to designate future commodity derivatives  as cash flow hedges under sfas this means that  in future periods as oil and gas prices fluctuate  our derivatives will be marked to market through our statement of operations as other income loss instead of through accumulated other comprehensive income on our balance sheet 
additionally  all realized gains or losses on these derivatives in future periods will be reported in other income loss instead of oil and gas sales 
this accounting treatment affects the timing and classification of income loss from derivatives  but it has no effect on cash flow from operating activities 
since we cannot predict future oil and gas prices  we cannot predict the effect that this accounting treatment will have on oil and gas sales or other income loss in future periods 
oil and gas production costs on an mcfe basis increased from 
per mcfe in to per mcfe in the rates remained relatively constant with the rates 
the increase in operating costs in was primarily due to the added expense related to higher cost oil properties acquired in connection with the swr merger  as well as increased production tax costs related to higher product prices 
it is likely that these factors will continue to contribute to higher production costs in future periods 
depletion on an mcfe basis increased from and from comparing to  depletion expense increased million  of which rate variances accounted for a million increase and production variances accounted for a million decrease 
comparing to  depletion expense increased million  of which rate variances accounted for a million increase and production variances accounted for a million increase 
depletion rates for each depletable group are a function of net capitalized costs and estimated reserve quantities 
the rates for are expected to be similar to the rates 
general and administrative g a expenses  excluding non cash stock based employee compensation  were higher than and higher than due primarily to higher personnel costs  professional fees and insurance costs 
professional fees include approximately  related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of regarding internal control over financial reporting 
g a expenses for include a non cash credit reduction of expense of  for stock based employee compensation required by financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
a non cash charge of  was required for the period and a credit of  was needed for because the amount of this non cash provision or credit is based on the quoted market value of our common stock  the future results of our operations may be subject to significant volatility based on changes in the market price of our common stock 
exploration costs since we follow the successful efforts method of accounting  our results of operations are adversely affected during any accounting period in which significant seismic costs  exploratory dry hole costs  and unproved acreage impairments are expensed 
in  we charged to expense million of exploration costs  as compared to million in and million in most of these costs were incurred in south louisiana and mississippi 
we plan to spend approximately million on exploration and development activities in primarily in the same core exploration areas as in since exploratory drilling involves a high degree of risk  it is likely that a significant portion of this will be charged to exploration costs in however  we cannot predict our success rates and  accordingly  cannot predict our exploration costs related to abandonment and impairment costs 
gains and losses on property sales gain on sales of property and equipment for was million  as compared to  in and million in the gain included the sale of the jo mill unit in borden county  texas 
loss on sale of property and equipment for was million  as compared to  in and million in the loss included the sale of the romere pass unit in plaquemines parish  louisiana 
interest expense interest expense was million in as compared to million in and million in in may  our indebtedness increased as a result of our assuming and refinancing approximately million of bank debt in the swr acquisition 
the average daily principal balance outstanding under the credit facilities in was million  as compared to million in and million in the effective annual interest rate on bank debt  including bank fees and designated interest rate derivatives  in was  as compared to in and in we anticipate our interest expense to be approximately higher than because of the increased indebtedness 
change in fair value of derivatives we recorded a loss of million for the change in fair value of derivatives compared to a loss of million for each of the previous two periods 
the increase is partly attributable to certain derivative contracts being designated as cash flow hedges prior to  and as a result  changes in the fair value of such instruments were not recorded in this account 
beginning in  because we have not designated any derivative contracts as cash flow hedges  all cash settlements and changes resulting from mark to market valuations are recorded as changes in fair value of derivatives 
future gains or losses on changes in derivatives will be impacted by the volatility of commodity and interest rates  as well as the terms of any new derivative contracts 
other at december   our cumulative tax loss carryforwards were approximately million 
based upon current commodity prices and production volumes  as well as the availability of tax planning strategies such as elective capitalization of intangible drilling costs  we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize these tax loss carryforwards before they expire beginning in 
accordingly  no valuation allowance exists at december  a valuation allowance at december  was reversed during liquidity and capital resources overview our primary financial resource is our base of oil and gas reserves 
we pledge our producing oil and gas properties to secure a line of credit  called a revolving credit facility  with a group of banks 
the banks establish a borrowing base by making an estimate of the collateral value of our oil and gas properties 
we borrow funds on the revolving credit facility as needed to supplement our operating cash flow as a financing source for our capital expenditure program 
our ability to fund our capital expenditure program is dependent upon the level of product prices and the success of our exploration program in replacing our existing oil and gas reserves 
if product prices decrease  our operating cash flow may decrease and the banks may require additional collateral or reduce our borrowing base  thus reducing funds available to fund our capital expenditure program 
the effects of product prices on cash flow can be mitigated through the use of commodity derivatives 
if we are unable to replace our oil and gas reserves through our exploration program  we may also suffer a reduction in our operating cash flow and access to funds under the revolving credit facility 
under extreme circumstances  product price reductions or exploration drilling failures could allow the banks to seek to foreclose on our oil and gas properties  thereby threatening our financial viability 
in this section  we will describe our current plans for capital spending  identify the capital resources available to finance our capital spending  and discuss the principal factors that can affect our liquidity and capital resources 
capital expenditures our planned expenditures for exploration and development activities during total million  as summarized by area in the following table 
total planned expenditures year ended december  percentage of total louisiana permian basin south and east texas utah montana mississippi other our actual expenditures during may be substantially higher or lower than these estimates since our plans for exploration and development activities may change during the year 
other factors  such as prevailing product prices and the availability of capital resources  could also increase or decrease the ultimate level of expenditures during approximately of the planned expenditures relate to exploratory prospects 
exploratory prospects involve a higher degree of risk than developmental prospects 
to offset the higher risk  we generally strive to achieve a higher reserve potential and rate of return on investments in exploratory prospects 
we do not attempt to forecast our success rate on exploratory drilling 
accordingly  these current estimates do not include costs we may incur to complete any future successful exploratory wells and construct the required production facilities for these wells 
also  we are actively searching for other opportunities to increase our oil and gas reserves  including the evaluation of new prospects for exploratory and developmental drilling activities and potential acquisitions of proved oil and gas properties 
we project that substantially all of the cash needed to finance our planned expenditures for exploration and development activities in will be provided by operating activities 
to the extent that actual costs exceed our cash provided by operating activities  we plan to utilize some or all of our existing availability under the revolving credit facility to finance such excess 
cash flow provided by operating activities substantially all of our cash flow from operating activities is derived from the production of our oil and gas reserves 
we use this cash flow to fund our on going exploration and development activities in search of new oil and gas reserves 
variations in cash flow from operating activities may impact our level of exploration and development expenditures 
cash flow provided by operating activities for was higher than due to the combined effects of several drivers 
the positive benefits of an increase in oil and gas sales  driven primarily by higher oil and gas prices  were offset in part by increases in production costs  costs of settling commodity hedges and interest expense 
our primary source of cash from operating activities is our oil and gas sales  net of production costs 
our cash flow provided by operating activities is subject to material variation from changes in oil and gas production levels and product prices 
higher oil and gas prices also resulted in an increase in cash required to settle derivative contracts  excluding those contracts that contain a financing element as in the case of the contracts assumed in swr acquisition 
interest expense increased in due primarily to higher levels of indebtedness resulting from the swr acquisition 
credit facilities a group of banks have provided us with a revolving credit facility on which we rely heavily for both our short term liquidity working capital and our long term financing needs 
the funds available to us at any time under this revolving credit facility are limited to the amount of the borrowing base established by the banks 
as long as we have sufficient availability under this credit facility to meet our obligations as they come due  we will have sufficient liquidity and will be able to fund any short term working capital deficit 
in connection with the acquisition of swr  we entered into new credit facilities with the banks that provided for an million increase in borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility and established a new million senior term credit facility 
immediately prior to the swr acquisition  we had million of availability under the revolving credit facility  taking into account million of outstanding letters of credit 
of the million of funds needed to finance the purchase of swr net of cash acquired of million  million was provided through a private placement of common stock  million net of repayments was borrowed under the senior term credit facility  and million was obtained from the revolving credit facility 
giving effect to the million increase in the borrowing base  this purchase transaction initially used million of availability on the revolving credit facility 
all other changes in our availability under the revolving credit facilities combined to provide a million increase 
as a result  our availability under the revolving credit facility at december   taking into account outstanding letters of credit  increased to million 
using the credit facility for both our short term liquidity and long term financing needs can cause unusual fluctuations in our reported working capital  depending on the timing of cash receipts and expenditures 
on a daily basis  we use most of our available cash to pay down our outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility  which is classified as a non current liability since we currently have no required principal reductions 
as we use cash to pay a non current liability  our reported working capital decreases 
conversely  as we draw on the revolving credit facility for funds to pay current liabilities such as payables for drilling and operating costs  our reported working capital increases 
also  volatility in oil and gas prices can cause significant fluctuations in reported working capital as we record changes in the fair value of derivatives from period to period 
for these reasons  the working capital covenant related to the revolving credit facility requires us to i include the amount of funds available under this facility as a current asset  ii exclude current assets and liabilities related to the fair value of derivatives  and iii exclude current maturities of vendor finance obligations  when computing the working capital ratio at any balance sheet date 
working capital computed for loan compliance purposes differs from our working capital computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
since compliance with financial covenants is a material requirement under the credit facilities  we consider the loan compliance working capital computation to be useful as a measure of our liquidity because it includes the funds available to us under the revolving credit facility and is not affected by the volatility in working capital caused by changes in fair value of derivatives 
our reported working capital deficit increased from million at december  to million at december  due primarily to an increase in current liabilities related to the fair value of derivatives 
after giving effect to the adjustments  our working capital computed for loan compliance purposes was a positive million at december   as compared to a positive million at december  the following table reconciles our gaap working capital to the working capital computed for loan compliance purposes at december  and december  december  december  in thousands working capital deficit per gaap add funds available under the revolving credit facility exclude fair value of derivatives classified as current assets or current liabilities exclude current maturities of vendor finance obligations working capital per loan covenant the acquisition of swr significantly increased our indebtedness and decreased our liquidity 
our long term debt including current maturities increased from million at december  to million at december  as a result  our long term debt as a percentage of total capitalization debt plus stockholders equity increased from to 
this additional leverage increased our cost of capital initially by approximately basis points due primarily to a higher rate of interest on the senior term credit facility and the amortization of debt issue costs incurred in connection with the new credit facilities 
since we rely on the credit facilities for both short term liquidity and long term financing needs  it is important that we comply in all material respects with the applicable loan agreements  including financial covenants that are computed quarterly 
the working capital covenant requires us to maintain positive working capital using the computations described above 
other financial covenants under the credit facilities require us to maintain a ratio of indebtedness to cash flow  as each is determined in accordance with the applicable credit facility  of no more than to  and a ratio of reserve value to indebtedness  as each is determined in accordance with the applicable credit facility  of at least to while we were in compliance with all financial and non financial covenants at december   our increased leverage may result in our failing to comply with one or more of these covenants in the future 
if we fail to meet any of these loan covenants  we would ask the banks to allow us sufficient time to obtain additional capital resources through alternative means 
if a suitable arrangement could not be reached with the banks  the banks could accelerate the indebtedness and seek to foreclose on the pledged assets 
the banks redetermine the borrowing base at least twice a year  in may and november 
if at any time  the borrowing base is less than the amount of outstanding indebtedness  we will be required to i pledge additional collateral  ii prepay the excess in not more than five equal monthly installments  or iii elect to convert the entire amount of outstanding indebtedness to a term obligation based on amortization formulas set forth in the applicable loan agreement 
alternative capital resources although our base of oil and gas reserves  as collateral for the revolving credit facility  has historically been our primary capital resource  we have in the past  and we believe we could in the future  use alternative capital resources  such as asset sales  vendor financing arrangements  and or public or private issuances of common stock 
we could also issue subordinated debt or preferred stock in a public or a private placement if we choose to raise capital through either of these markets 
while we believe we would be able to obtain funds through one or more of these alternatives  if needed  there can be no assurance that these capital resources would be available on terms acceptable to us 
contractual obligations and contingent commitments in connection with the acquisition of swr  we entered into new credit facilities with the banks 
at december   based on the new terms  we are contractually obligated to repay indebtedness of million on the revolving loan in and million on the senior term loan in in addition  we assumed approximately million of asset retirement obligations in connection with the swr acquisition  substantially all of which are expected to mature after the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  by payment due date 
payments due by period total thereafter in thousands contractual obligations secured bank credit facilities revolving loan senior term loan abandonment obligations lease obligations other total contractual obligations excluded from the table above is our mark to market liability related to commodity and interest rate derivatives 
our derivative obligations  based on mark to market valuations at december   would mature as follows    and  known trends and uncertainties we have identified several known trends and uncertainties that are likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or operating performance if these trends continue or develop and or if these uncertainties occur 
the following is a description of these known trends and uncertainties and  in the case of known trends  their affect on our financial condition or operating performance  and in the case of known uncertainties  the affect they would have if they were to occur 
focus on exploration activities we are primarily an exploration company 
for  approximately of our planned capital expenditures relate to exploratory prospects 
exploration activities involve the drilling of wells in areas where there is little or no known production 
exploration is a higher risk activity than development 
development activities relate to increasing oil or natural gas production from an area that is know to be productive by drilling additional wells  working over and recompleting existing wells and other production enhancement techniques 
exploration projects are identified through subjective analysis of geological and geophysical data  including the use of d seismic and other available technology 
by comparison  the identification of development prospects is significantly based upon existing production surrounding or adjacent to the proposed drilling site 
because our focus is on exploration activities  we have a greater risk of drilling dry holes or not finding oil and natural gas that can be produced economically 
the seismic data and other technology we use does not allow us to know with certainty prior to drilling a well whether oil or natural gas is present or can be produced economically 
we cannot assure you that any of our future exploration efforts will be successful  and if such activities are unsuccessful  it will have a significant adverse affect on our results of operations  cash flow and capital resources 
replacement of production with new reserves in general  the volume of production from an oil and gas property declines as reserves related to that property are depleted 
the decline rates depend upon reservoir characteristics 
historically  our oil and gas properties have had steep rates of decline and short estimated productive lives 
the average productive life of our reserves at december  is approximately years  based on production levels 
our oil and gas reserves will decline as they are produced unless we are able to conduct successful exploration and development activities or acquire properties with proved reserves 
because we are currently focused on exploration activities  our ability to replace produced reserves is subject to a higher level of risk than it was when we were drilling development wells in the austin chalk trend 
volatility of oil and gas prices historically  the markets for oil and gas have been volatile  and we believe that they are likely to continue to be volatile 
significant changes in oil and gas prices may result from relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty and other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot predict  with any degree of certainty  future oil and natural gas prices 
changes in oil and natural gas prices significantly affect our revenues  operating results  profitability and the value of our oil and gas reserves 
those prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures  our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital and the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically 
the amount we can borrow under our revolving credit facility is subject to periodic redeterminations based in part on current prices for oil and natural gas at the time of the redetermination 
changes in oil and gas prices impact both our estimated future net revenue and the estimated quantity of proved reserves 
price increases may permit additional quantities of reserves to be produced economically  and price decreases may render uneconomic the production of reserves previously classified as proved 
thus  we may experience material increases and decreases in reserve quantities solely as a result of price changes and not as a result of drilling or well performance 
we attempt to optimize the price we receive for our oil and gas production while maintaining a prudent hedging program to mitigate our exposure to declining product prices 
our management may elect to enter into and terminate hedges based on expectations of future market conditions 
if prices continue to rise while our hedges are in place  we will forego revenue we would have otherwise received 
if we terminate a hedge because we anticipate an increase in product prices that we would not realize with the hedge in place  and product prices do not increase as anticipated  we may be exposed to downside risk that would not have existed otherwise 
reserve estimates the accuracy of proved reserves estimates and estimated future net revenues from such reserves is a function of the quality of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data and is subject to various assumptions including assumptions required by the sec relating to oil and gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  and other matters 
although we believe that our estimated proved reserves represent reserves that we are reasonably certain to recover  actual future production  oil and gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves will most likely vary from the assumptions and estimates used to determine proved reserves 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and value of our oil and gas reserves  which in turn could adversely affect our cash flow  results of operations and the availability of capital resources 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing oil and gas prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the present value of proved reserves will not necessarily equal the current fair market value of our estimated oil and gas reserves 
in accordance with the reserve reporting requirements of the sec  the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than those as of the date of the estimate 
the timing of both the production and the expenses with respect to the development and production of oil and gas properties will affect the timing of future net cash flows from proved reserves and their present value 
the estimated proved reserve information is based upon a reserve report prepared by independent engineers 
from time to time  estimates of our reserves are also made by our banks in establishing the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility and by our engineers for use in developing business plans and making various decisions 
such estimates may vary significantly and have a material effect upon our business decisions and available capital resources 
credit risks we sell our oil and natural gas production to various customers  serve as operator in the drilling  completion and operation of oil and gas wells  and enter into derivatives with various counterparties 
as appropriate  we obtain letters of credit to secure amounts due from our principal oil and gas purchasers and follow other procedures to monitor credit risk from joint owners and derivatives counterparties 
we cannot assure you that we will not suffer any economic loss related to credit risks in the future 
uncertainties regarding liquidity and capital resources our cash flow forecasts indicate that the amount of funds available to us under revolving credit facility  when combined with our anticipated operating cash flow  will be sufficient to finance our capital expenditures and will provide us with adequate liquidity at least through the although we believe the assumptions and estimates made in our forecasts are reasonable  uncertainties exist which could cause the borrowing base to be less than expected  cash flow to be less than expected  or capital expenditures to be more than expected 
below is a discussion of uncertainties that are likely to have a material effect on our liquidity and capital resources if such uncertainties occur 
adverse changes in reserve estimates or commodity prices could reduce the borrowing base 
the banks establish the borrowing base at least twice annually by preparing a reserve report using price risk assumptions they believe are proper under the circumstances 
any adverse changes in estimated quantities of reserves  the pricing parameters being used  or the risk factors being applied  since the date of the last borrowing base determination  could lower the borrowing base under the revolving credit facility 
adverse changes in reserve estimates or commodity prices could reduce our cash flow from operating activities 
we rely on estimates of reserves to forecast our cash flow from operating activities 
if the production from those reserves is delayed or is lower than expected  our cash flow from operating activities may be lower than we anticipated 
commodity prices also impact our cash flow from operating activities 
based on december  reserve estimates  we project that a drop in oil price and a 
drop in gas price would reduce our gross revenues in by approximately million and million  respectively 
adverse changes in the borrowing base may cause outstanding debt to equal or exceed the borrowing base 
in this event  we will not be able to borrow any additional funds  and we will be required to repay the excess or convert the debt to a term note 
without availability under the revolving credit facility  we may be unable to meet our obligations as they mature 
delays in bringing successful wells on production may reduce our liquidity 
as a general rule  we experience a significant lag time between the initial cash outlay on a prospect and the inclusion of any value for such prospect in the borrowing base under the revolving credit facility 
until a well is on production  the banks may assign only a minimal borrowing base value to the well  and cash flows from the well are not available to fund our operating expense 
delays in bringing wells on production may reduce the borrowing base significantly  depending on the amounts borrowed and the length of the delays 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates summary in this section  we will identify the critical accounting policies we follow in preparing our financial statements and disclosures 
many of these policies require us to make difficult  subjective and complex judgments in the course of making estimates of matters that are inherently imprecise 
we will explain the nature of these estimates  assumptions and judgments  and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported in our financial statements under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the following table lists our critical accounting policies  the estimates and assumptions that can have a significant impact on the application of these accounting policies  and the financial statement accounts affected by these estimates and assumptions

significant estimates and assumptions oil and gas reserves reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate depends on the quality of available geological and engineering data  the precision of the interpretation of that data  and judgment based on experience and training 
annually  we engage an independent petroleum engineering firm to evaluate our oil and gas reserves 
as a part of this process  our internal reservoir engineer and the independent engineers exchange information and attempt to reconcile any material differences in estimates and assumptions 
while we believe this reconciliation process improves the accuracy of the reserve estimates by reducing the likelihood of a material error in judgment  it is possible that in exchanging information  our internal reservoir engineer could influence the independent engineer s estimates and assumptions 
the techniques used in estimating reserves usually depend on the nature and extent of available data  and the accuracy of the estimates vary accordingly 
as a general rule  the degree of accuracy of reserve estimates varies with the reserve classification and the related accumulation of available data  as shown in the following table 
type of reserves nature of available data degree of accuracy proved undeveloped data from offsetting wells  seismic data least accurate proved developed nonproducing logs  core samples  well tests  pressure data more accurate proved developed producing production history  pressure data over time most accurate assumptions as to future commodity prices and operating and capital costs also play a significant role in estimating oil and gas reserves and the estimated present value of the cash flows to be received from the future production of those reserves 
volumes of recoverable reserves are affected by the assumed prices and costs due to what is known as the economic limit that point in the future when the projected costs and expenses of producing recoverable reserves exceed the projected revenues from the reserves 
but more significantly  the estimated present value of future cash flows from the reserves is extremely sensitive to prices and costs  and may vary materially based on different assumptions 
sec financial accounting and reporting standards require that pricing parameters be tied to the price received for oil and natural gas on the effective date of the reserve report 
this requirement can result in significant changes from period to period given the volatile nature of oil and gas product prices  as illustrated in the following table 
proved reserves average price present value oil a mmbbls gas bcf oil a bbl gas mcf of proved reserves in millions as of december a includes natural gas liquids valuation of unproved properties placing a fair market value on unproved properties also known as prospects is very subjective since there is no quoted market for undeveloped exploratory prospects 
the negotiated price of any prospect between a willing seller and willing buyer depends on the specific facts regarding the prospect  including the location of the prospect in relation to known fields and reservoirs  available markets and transportation systems for oil and gas production in the vicinity  and other critical services  the nature and extent of geological and geophysical data on the prospect  the terms of the leases holding the acreage in the prospect  such as ownership interests  expiration terms  delay rental obligations  depth limitations  drilling and marketing restrictions  and similar terms  the prospect s risk adjusted potential for return on investment  giving effect to such factors as potential reserves to be discovered  drilling and completion costs  prevailing commodity prices  and other economic factors  and the results of drilling activity in close proximity to the prospect that could either enhance or condemn the prospect s chances of success 
valuation allowance for nol carryforwards in computing our provision for income taxes  we must assess the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  which consist primarily of net operating loss nol carryforwards 
for federal income tax purposes  these nol carryforwards  if unused  expire to years from the year of origination 
generally  we assess our ability to fully utilize these carryforwards by comparing expected future book income to expected future taxable income based on the assumption that we will produce our existing reserves  as scheduled for production in our reserve report  under current economic conditions 
if future book income does not exceed future taxable income by amounts sufficient to utilize nols before they expire  we must impair the resulting deferred tax asset 
these computations are inherently imprecise due to the extensive use of estimates and assumptions 
as a result  we may make additional impairments to allow for such uncertainties 
effects of estimates and assumptions on financial statements generally accepted accounting principles do not require  or even permit  the restatement of previously issued financial statements due to changes in estimates unless such estimates were unreasonable or did not comply with applicable sec accounting rules 
we are required to use our best judgment in making estimates and assumptions  taking into consideration the best and most current data available to us at the time of the estimate 
at each accounting period  we make a new estimate using new data  and continue the cycle 
you should be aware that estimates prepared at various times may be substantially different due to new or additional information 
while an estimate made at one point in time may differ from an estimate made at a later date  both may be proper due to the differences in available information or assumptions 
in this section  we will discuss the effects of different estimates on our financial statements 
provision for dd a we compute our provision for dd a on a unit of production method 
each quarter  we use the following formulas to compute the provision for dd a for each of our producing properties or appropriate groups of properties based on geographical and geological similarities dd a rate unamortized cost beginning of period reserves provision for dd a dd a rate current period production reserve estimates have a significant impact on the dd a rate 
if reserve estimates for a property or group of properties are revised downward in future periods  the dd a rate for that property or group of properties will increase as a result of the revision 
alternatively  if reserve estimates are revised upward  the dd a rate will decrease 
impairment of unproved properties each quarter  we review our unproved oil and gas properties to determine if there has been  in our judgment  an impairment in value of each prospect that we consider individually significant 
to the extent that the carrying cost of a prospect exceeds its estimated value  we make a provision for impairment of unproved properties  and record the provision as abandonments and impairments within exploration costs on our statement of operations 
if the value is revised upward in a future period  we do not reverse the prior provision  and we continue to carry the prospect at a net cost that is lower than its estimated value 
if the value is revised downward in a future period  an additional provision for impairment is made in that period 
impairment of proved properties each quarter  we assess our producing properties for impairment 
if we determine there has been an impairment in any of our producing properties or appropriate groups of properties based on geographical and geological similarities  we will estimate the value of each affected property 
in accordance with applicable accounting standards  the value for this purpose is a fair value instead of a standardized reserve value as prescribed by the sec 
we attempt to value each property using reserve classifications and pricing parameters similar to what a willing seller and willing buyer might use 
these parameters may include escalations of prices instead of constant pricing  and they may also include the risk adjusted value of reserves that do not qualify as proved reserves 
to the extent that the carrying cost for the affected property exceeds its estimated value  we make a provision for impairment of proved properties 
if the value is revised upward in a future period  we do not reverse the prior provision  and we continue to carry the property at a net cost that is lower than its estimated value 
if the value is revised downward in a future period  an additional provision for impairment is made in that period 
accordingly  the carrying costs of producing properties on our balance sheet will vary from and often will be less than the present value of proved reserves for these properties 
judgment regarding status of in progress wells on a quarterly basis  we review the status of each in progress well to determine the proper accounting treatment under the successful efforts method of accounting 
cumulative costs on in progress wells remain capitalized until their productive status becomes known 
if an in progress exploratory well is found to be unsuccessful often referred to as a dry hole prior to the issuance of our financial statements  we write off all costs incurred through the balance sheet date to abandonments and impairments expense  a component of exploration costs 
costs incurred on that dry hole after the balance sheet date are charged to exploration costs in the period incurred 
occasionally  we are unable to make a final determination about the productive status of a well prior to issuance of our financial statements 
in these cases  we leave the well classified as in progress until we have had sufficient time to conduct additional completion or testing operations and to evaluate the pertinent g g and engineering data obtained 
at the time when we are able to make a final determination of a well s productive status  the well is removed from the in progress status and the proper accounting treatment is recorded 
valuation allowance for nol carryforwards each quarter  we assess our ability to utilize nol carryforwards 
an increase in the valuation allowance from one period to the next will result in a decrease in our net deferred tax assets and a decrease in earnings 
similarly  a decrease in the valuation allowance will result in an increase in our net deferred tax assets and an increase in earnings 
this process requires estimates and assumptions which are complex and may vary materially from our actual ability to utilize nol carryforwards in the future 
also  the current tax laws in this area are complicated due to the impact of alternative minimum tax on the utilization of nol carryforwards 
as a mitigating factor  as long as we are actively drilling for new production  we have some tax planning strategies available to us  such as elective capitalization of intangible drilling costs  to help us utilize these nol carryforwards before they expire 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas 
sfas specifies the criteria required to record a nonmonetary asset exchange using carryover basis 
sfas is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring after july  the company will adopt this statement in the third quarter of  and it is not expected to have a material effect on the financial statements when adopted 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised share based payments sfas r 
sfas r requires that the cost from all share based payment transactions  including stock options  be recognized in the financial statements at fair value 
the company currently uses the intrinsic value method to account for these share based payments 
sfas r is effective for public companies in the first interim period after june  the company will adopt the provisions of this statement in the third quarter of and is currently assessing the effect of sfas r on the financial statements 
the financial accounting standards board has proposed fasb staff position no 
a fsp a  which has a comment deadline of march  fsp a would amend the present guidance in sfas  paragraphs and  regarding when exploratory drilling costs pending determination of proved reserves can be carried as an asset of an oil and gas company that uses the successful efforts accounting method 
based on our present understanding of this proposed statement  the adoption of fsp a will not have a significant impact on our results of operations 
at december  and  we had capitalized million and  respectively  of exploratory drilling costs applicable to wells that were pending determination of proved reserves 
all of the december  capitalized costs were classified as productive wells in all of the december  capitalized costs relate to wells for which drilling and completion activities are continuing 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s our business is impacted by fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates 
the following discussion is intended to identify the nature of these market risks  describe our strategy for managing such risks  and to quantify the potential affect of market volatility on our financial condition and results of operations 
oil and gas prices our financial condition  results of operations  and capital resources are highly dependent upon the prevailing market prices of  and demand for  oil and natural gas 
these commodity prices are subject to wide fluctuations and market uncertainties due to a variety of factors that are beyond our control 
these factors include the level of global demand for petroleum products  foreign supply of oil and gas  the establishment of and compliance with production quotas by oil exporting countries  weather conditions  the price and availability of alternative fuels  and overall economic conditions  both foreign and domestic 
we cannot predict future oil and gas prices with any degree of certainty 
sustained weakness in oil and gas prices may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  and may also reduce the amount of net oil and gas reserves that we can produce economically 
any reduction in reserves  including reductions due to price fluctuations  can reduce the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to obtain capital for our exploration and development activities 
similarly  any improvements in oil and gas prices can have a favorable impact on our financial condition  results of operations and capital resources 
based on december  reserve estimates  we project that a drop in the price per bbl of oil and a 
drop in the price per mcf of gas would reduce our gross revenues for the year ending december  by million 
from time to time  we utilize commodity derivatives  consisting primarily of swaps  floors and collars to attempt to optimize the price received for our oil and natural gas production 
when using swaps to hedge our oil and natural gas production  we receive a fixed price for the respective commodity and pay a floating market price as defined in each contract generally nymex futures prices  resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty 
when purchasing floors  we receive a fixed price put strike price if the market price falls below the put strike price for the respective commodity 
if the market price is greater than the put strike price  no payments are due from either party 
costless collars are a combination of puts and calls  and contain a fixed floor price put strike price and ceiling price call strike price 
if the market price for the respective commodity exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price  then we receive the fixed price and pay the market price 
if the market price is between the call and the put strike prices  no payments are due from either party 
the commodity derivatives we use differ from futures contracts in that there is not a contractual obligation that requires or permits the future physical delivery of the hedged products 
we do not enter into commodity derivatives for trading purposes 
in addition to commodity derivatives  we may  from time to time  sell a portion of our gas production under short term contracts at fixed prices 
the decision to initiate or terminate commodity hedges is made by management based on its expectation of future market price movements 
we have no set goals for the percentage of our production we hedge and we do not use any formulas or triggers in deciding when to initiate or terminate a hedge 
if we enter into swaps or collars and the floating market price at the settlement date is higher than the fixed price or the fixed ceiling price  we will forego revenue we would have otherwise received 
if we terminate a swap  collar or floor because we anticipate future increases in market prices  we may be exposed to downside risk that would not have existed otherwise 
the following summarizes information concerning our net positions in open commodity derivatives applicable to periods subsequent to december  floors gas oil mmbtu floor bbls floor production period st quarter st quarter nd quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter collars gas oil mmbtu a floor ceiling bbls floor ceiling production period st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter a one mmbtu equals one mcf at a btu factor of  in december  we terminated gas swaps covering  mmbtu at a fixed gain of million which will be realized in the first quarter of we use a sensitivity analysis technique to evaluate the hypothetical effect that changes in the market value of oil and gas may have on the fair value of our commodity derivatives 
a per barrel change in the price of oil and a 
per mmbtu change in the price of gas would change the fair value of our commodity derivatives by approximately million 
interest rates all of our outstanding bank indebtedness at december  is subject to market rates of interest as determined from time to time by the banks pursuant to our credit facilities 
we may designate borrowings under our credit facilities as either base rate loans or eurodollar loans 
base rate loans bear interest at a fluctuating rate that is linked to the discount rates established by the federal reserve board 
eurodollar loans bear interest at a fluctuating rate that is linked to libor 
any increases in these interest rates can have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow 
we assumed our interest rate swaps in connection with the acquisition of swr
