item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and the financial statements and notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods 
overview exelixis  inc is a biotechnology company whose primary mission is to leverage its biological expertise and integrated drug discovery capabilities to develop high quality  differentiated pharmaceutical products for the treatment of cancer  metabolic disorders  cardiovascular disease and other serious diseases 
our research is designed to identify novel genes and proteins that  when expressed at altered levels  either decrease or increase the activity of a specific disease pathway in a therapeutically relevant manner 
these genes and proteins represent either potential product targets or drugs that may treat disease or prevent disease initiation or progression 
we believe that our proprietary technologies also are valuable to other industries whose products can be enhanced by an understanding of dna or proteins  including the agrochemical  agricultural and diagnostic industries 
our clinical development pipeline currently includes the following compounds in cancer and renal disease xl becatecarin  for which a phase clinical trial has been initiated in patients with bile duct tumors  xl  initially an anticancer compound  currently being developed as a treatment for renal disease for which we anticipate initiating additional clinical studies in  xl and xl  anticancer compounds currently in phase clinical trials  xl  an anticancer compound for which we anticipate initiating a phase clinical trial during the first half of  and xl  xl and xl  anticancer compounds for which we anticipate filing investigational new drug applications inds in the first half of our preclinical pipeline is comprised of six programs in advanced lead optimization 
this includes several small molecule compounds designed to target the liver x receptor lxr  farnesoid x receptor fxr and mineralocorticoid receptor mr 
these targets are nuclear hormone receptors nhrs that are implicated in various metabolic and cardiovascular disorders 
we also have oncology programs focused on the inhibition of the raf  akt sk and igfr kinases  which are implicated in various cancers 
we anticipate advancing at least some of these preclinical programs to drug candidate status in  with the potential of filing inds beginning in we have incurred net losses since inception and expect to incur substantial losses for at least the next several years as we continue our research and development activities  including manufacturing and development expenses for compounds in preclinical and clinical studies 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash and investments 
we anticipate that our current cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and funding that we expect to receive from collaborators will enable us to maintain our currently planned operations for at least the next months 
it is possible that we will seek additional financing within this timeframe through public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
changes to our current operating plan may require us to consume available capital resources significantly sooner than we expect 
we have established collaborations with major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies based on the strength of our technologies and biological expertise to support additional development of our proprietary products 
through these collaborations we obtain license fees  research funding  and the opportunity to receive milestone payments and royalties from research results and subsequent product development activities 
in addition  many of our collaborations have been structured strategically to provide us with access to technology that may help to advance our internal programs more rapidly while at the same time enabling us to retain rights to use these technologies in different industries 
we have also established collaborations with leading companies in the agrochemical industries that allow us to continue expanding our internal development capabilities and 
table of contents diversifying our revenue stream while providing our partners with novel targets and assays 
we have ongoing commercial collaborations with several leading pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agrochemical companies  including glaxosmithkline  bristol myers squibb company two collaborations  dow agrosciences llc  two collaborations  renessen llc  bayer cropscience lp formerly aventis usa lp and bayer corporation 
we expect to continue to use corporate partnering as a strategic tool to cultivate our assets  fund our operations and expand the therapeutic and commercial potential of our pipeline 
as our company has matured and our development efforts have intensified  we have restructured the organization as needed to reallocate resources and enhance the efficiency of our operations 
we believe that these efforts have strengthened us by enabling us to achieve an appropriate functional balance within the organization 
acquisitions as part of our business strategy  we consider merger and acquisition opportunities that may provide us with products on the market  later stage compounds  technologies to accelerate our downstream drug discovery efforts or access to capital 
x ceptor therapeutics in october  we completed our acquisition of x ceptor therapeutics  inc x ceptor  a privately held company located in san diego  california  was focused on the discovery and development of small molecules that modulate nhrs 
nhrs represent a promising class of clinically and commercially validated gene targets that are implicated in a wide range of metabolic and cardiovascular disorders 
x ceptor had developed biology assets and advanced lead optimization programs focused on lxr  fxr and mr 
the combination of exelixis small molecule discovery engine and oncology pipeline with x ceptor s proprietary reverse endocrinology platform and pipeline of nhr targeted compounds advances our strategy to diversify into new therapeutic areas 
a significant part of this strategy is to advance our metabolism program  which was greatly enhanced through the acquisition of x ceptor 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase of assets 
the total consideration for the acquisition was approximately million  which consisted of approximately million shares of our common stock  million in cash and million in transaction costs 
the transaction costs included financial advisory  legal  accounting and other fees 
as a result  we recorded tangible assets of million  liabilities of million  assembled workforce of million and expense associated with the purchase of in process research and development of million  representing the fair value of three primary research projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and that have no alternative future use 
agrinomics in july  exelixis plant sciences formerly agritope  inc and bayer cropscience formerly aventis cropscience usa lp formed a joint venture  agrinomics llc  to conduct a research  development and commercialization program in the field of agricultural functional genomics 
as a result of our acquisition of exelixis plant sciences  we owned a interest in agrinomics  while bayer cropscience owned the remaining interest 
in may  exelixis purchased from bayer cropscience its interest in agrinomics in exchange for releasing bayer cropscience from all future obligations under the joint venture agreement 
genomica on december   we acquired approximately of the outstanding common stock of genomica corporation  a bio informatics software company 
the acquisition of genomica was completed in january 
table of contents artemis in may  we acquired of the outstanding capital stock of artemis pharmaceuticals gmbh  a privately held genetics and functional genomics company organized under the laws of germany 
in december and january  we exercised call options for the remaining of the outstanding capital stock of artemis 
agritope in december  we completed our acquisition of agritope  inc as a result of the acquisition  agritope became our wholly owned subsidiary  and we subsequently changed its name to exelixis plant sciences  inc critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition most of our revenues are generated from complex research and licensing arrangements 
these research and licensing arrangements may include up front non refundable payments 
although these up front payments are generally non refundable  under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap we defer the revenues under these arrangements and recognize the revenues on a straight line basis over the relevant periods specified in the agreements  generally the research term 
our research and license arrangements may also include milestone payments 
although these milestone payments are generally non refundable once the milestone is achieved  we recognize the milestone revenues on a straight line basis over the research term of the arrangement 
this typically results in a portion of the milestone being recognized at the date the milestone is achieved  and the balance being recognized over the remaining research term of the agreement 
it is our understanding that there is diversity in practice on the recognition of milestone revenue 
other companies have adopted an alternative acceptable milestone revenue recognition policy whereby the full milestone fee is recognized upon completion of the milestone 
if we had adopted such a policy  our revenues recorded to date would have increased and our deferred revenues would have decreased by a material amount compared to total revenue recognized 
revenues from chemistry collaborations are generally recognized upon the delivery of accepted compounds 
goodwill and intangible impairment as of december   our consolidated balance sheet included approximately million of goodwill and other intangible assets 
under us gaap  we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and on 
table of contents an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual impairment tests indicate that the asset might be impaired 
we will also evaluate other intangible assets for impairment when impairment indicators are identified 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
these estimates include forecasted revenues  which are inherently difficult to predict 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
furthermore  our impairment evaluation of goodwill requires management to exercise judgment in the identification of our reporting units 
the impairment tests for goodwill are performed at the reporting unit level  which currently management has identified to be one unit  the single operating segment disclosed in our current financial statements 
in the future  management may determine that the impairment tests should be performed at a level below the single operating segment disclosed in our current financial statements  depending upon whether certain criteria are met 
clinical trial accruals substantial portions of our pre clinical studies and all of our clinical trials have been performed by third party contract research organizations cros and other vendors 
we accrue expenses for pre clinical studies performed by our vendors as we are required to make certain estimates over the term of the service period and adjust our estimates as required 
we accrue costs for clinical trial activities performed by contract research organizations based upon the estimated amount of work completed on each study 
for clinical trial expenses  the significant factors used in estimating accruals include the number of patients enrolled and for how long they have been enrolled in the study 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  correspondence with contract research organizations and review of contractual terms 
however  if we have incomplete or inaccurate information  we may underestimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time 
in this event  we could record significant research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity level becomes known 
all such costs are charged to research and development expenses as incurred 
no material adjustments to preclinical study and clinical trial expenses have been recognized 
purchased in process research and development we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
to assist in determining the value of the in process research and development and certain other intangibles  a third party valuation is typically obtained as of the acquisition date 
we use the income approach to value in process research and development 
the income approach is based on the premise that the value of a security or asset is the present value of the future earning capacity that is available for distribution to the subject investors in the security or asset 
we perform a discounted cash flow analysis  using anticipated revenues  expenses and net cash flow forecasts related to the technology 
given the high risk associated with the development of new drugs  we adjust the revenue and expense forecasts to reflect the risk of advancement through the regulatory approval process based on the stage of development in the regulatory process 
such a valuation requires significant estimates and assumptions 
we believe the fair value assigned to the in process research and development is based on reasonable assumptions 
however  these assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
additionally  estimates for the purchase price allocation may change as subsequent information becomes available 
no material adjustments to purchased in process research and development have been recognized 
stock option valuation the preparation of the financial statement footnotes requires us to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
while fair value may be readily determinable for awards of stock  market quotes are not available for long term  nontransferable stock options because these instruments are not traded 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options 
however  black 
table of contents scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options  which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the stock price volatility 
because our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and changes to the subjectivity input assumptions can materially affect the fair value of our employee stock options 
we are currently evaluating our option valuation methodologies and assumptions in lights of evolving accounting standards related to employee stock options 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and revenues total revenues and dollar and percentage changes as compared to the prior year are as follows dollar amounts are presented in millions year ended december  total revenues dollar increase percentage increase the increase in revenues from to was driven primarily by two million milestone payments earned under our bristol myers squibb collaboration  million in research and development funding from our collaboration with sankyo co  ltd  which we acquired as part of the x ceptor acquisition  million increase in research and development funding from our glaxosmithkline collaboration  and an increase in revenues of million from compound deliveries under our combinatorial chemistry collaborations 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in revenue of million related to the scheduled conclusion of our collaboration with protein design labs in may and million related to the upfront payments from bristol myers squibb being fully recognized on a straight line basis  which ended in july the increase in revenues from to was driven primarily by an increase of million from our corporate collaboration with glaxosmithkline and an increase of million from compound deliveries under our combinatorial chemistry collaborations 
this increase was partially offset by the reduction in revenue from the scheduled conclusion of our collaborations with pharmacia corporation in february and protein design labs in may total revenues by category for the years ended december   and in millions year ended december  research and development funding amortization of upfront payments delivery of compounds under chemistry collaborations milestones other total revenues revenues for the years ended december  and from research and development funding and the amortization of upfront payments were primarily related to our collaborations with glaxosmithkline  bristol myers squibb  and genoptera 
we recognized revenue under our combinatorial chemistry collaborations during the years ended december  and  which include agreements with cytokintetics  elan  schering plough  scios and merck 
we terminated most of these collaborations effective december  based on our 
table of contents assessment that they were no longer strategically or economically attractive 
milestone revenue was primarily comprised of milestones related to our bristol myers squibb and genoptera collaborations for the years ended december  and we classify our revenue from research and development funding  combinatorial chemistry collaborations  milestones  and other as contract revenue  while the amortization of upfront payments is classified as license revenue 
total revenues for the year ended december  from three of our collaborators represented approximately  and of total revenue  respectively 
for the year ended december   revenue from three of our collaborators represented approximately   and of total revenue  respectively 
for the year ended december   revenue from two of our collaborators represented approximately and of total revenue  respectively 
research and development expenses total research and development expenses and dollar and percentage changes as compared to the prior year are as follows dollar amounts are presented in millions year ended december  total research and development expense dollar increase percentage increase research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  laboratory supplies  consulting and facilities costs 
the change in compared to resulted primarily from the following costs consulting consulting expense  which includes services performed by cros and other vendors  increased to million  primarily due to activities related to advancing our clinical and preclinical development programs 
these activities include phase clinical trial activity for xl  phase trial activity for xl and xl  filing inds for xl and xl  and moving xl  xl  xl and xl through pre clinical testing in anticipation of filing inds in facilities facilities expense increased to million primarily due to our expansion into an additional building in south san francisco  california as a result of our expanding development operations and activities associated with advancing our preclinical and clinical development programs 
personnel staffing costs decreased to million primarily due to our june restructuring that consolidated our research and discovery organizations and included a reduction in force of employees 
salaries  bonuses  related fringe benefits  recruiting and relocation costs are included in personnel costs 
lab supplies lab supplies expense decreased to million also as a result of our june restructuring 
the increase in over resulted primarily from the following costs personnel staffing costs increased to million primarily due to expansion of our drug discovery and development operations  merit pay increases for employees and increasing employee benefit costs 
lab supplies lab supplies expense increased to million due primarily to an increase in drug discovery activities such as lead optimization  high throughput screening and compound synthesis 

table of contents consulting consulting expense increased to million  primarily due to activities related to advancing our clinical and preclinical development programs 
these activities included filing an ind for xl at the end of the first quarter of and commencing the phase clinical trial of xl in june  advancing a series of development candidates and back up compounds into preclinical testing in anticipation of filing additional ind  manufacturing drug substance for those compounds to support preclinical studies  and manufacturing xl to support initiation of registration trials 
facilities facilities expense increased to million primarily due to our expansion into an additional building in south san francisco  california as a result of our expanding drug discovery and development operations 
the table below summarizes the status of our current drug candidates program clinical status xl initiated phase clinical trial in june  trial is ongoing xl completed a phase clinical trial as an anticancer compound and we anticipate initiating additional clinical trials in for renal disease xl initiated phase clinical trial in june  trial is ongoing xl initiated phase clinical trial in october  trial is ongoing xl filed ind in december and we anticipate initiating a phase clinical trial in the first half of xl expect to file an ind in the first half of xl expect to file an ind in the first half of xl expect to file an ind in the first half of we currently estimate that typical phase clinical trials last approximately one year  phase clinical trials last approximately one to two years and phase clinical trials last approximately two to four years 
however  the length of time generally varies substantially according to factors relating to the trial  such as the type and intended use of the product candidate  the trial design and ability to enroll suitable patients 
we expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase in the future as we advance our compounds through development 
we currently do not have estimates of total costs to reach the market by a particular drug candidate or in total 
our potential therapeutic products are subject to a lengthy and uncertain regulatory process that may not result in the necessary regulatory approvals  which could adversely affect our ability to commercialize products 
in addition  clinical trials of our potential products may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy  which could prevent or significantly delay regulatory approval 
general and administrative expenses total general and administrative expenses and dollar and percentage changes as compared to the prior year are as follows dollar amounts are presented in millions year ended december  total g a expense dollar increase decrease percentage increase decrease general and administrative expenses consist primarily of staffing costs to support our research activities  facilities costs and professional expenses  such as legal and accounting fees 
the increase in from was primarily due to increases in staffing costs of million  facility expenses of million and legal and accounting expenses of million 
the decrease in from was primarily due to a decrease in non cash stock compensation expense of million  partially offset by increased insurance and patent costs 

table of contents acquired in process research and development in october  we completed the acquisition of x ceptor 
x ceptor was focused on the discovery and development of small molecules that modulate nuclear hormone receptors nhrs 
nhrs represent a promising class of clinically and commercially validated gene targets that are implicated in a wide range of metabolic and cardiovascular disorders 
the combination of exelixis small molecule discovery engine and oncology pipeline with x ceptor s proprietary reverse endocrinology platform and pipeline of nhr targeted compounds advances our strategy to diversify into new therapeutic areas 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase of assets 
the total consideration for the acquisition was approximately million  which consisted of approximately million shares of our common stock  million in cash and million in transaction costs 
the transaction costs included financial advisory  legal  accounting and other fees 
as a result  we recorded tangible assets of million  liabilities of million  assembled workforce of million and expense associated with the purchase of in process research and development of million  representing the fair value of three primary research projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and that have no alternative future use due to the early stage of the programs and the significant regulatory requirements remaining 
independent valuation experts assisted us during the valuation of the intangible assets acquired 
the valuation of the acquired in process research and development of million was determined using the income approach for each of the three projects in process 
the in process projects relate to the development of programs that are focused on lxr  valued at million  fxr  valued at million  and mr  valued at million  which are expected to be completed over approximately the next seven to ten years 
at the time of the acquisition  these programs did not have a development candidate and we anticipate that some of these programs may produce a development candidate during the income approach estimates the value of each acquired project in process based on its expected future cash flows 
the valuation analysis considered the percent complete of each in process research and development project 
the expected present value of the cash flows associated with the in process research and development projects was computed using a risk adjusted rate of return of which is considered commensurate with the inherent risk and percentage of completion of the in process projects 
the purchased technology was not considered to have reached technological feasibility and since it has no alternative future use due to the early stage of the programs  the considerable complexity and uniqueness of the programs and the significant regulatory requirements remaining  it was recorded as a component to operating expense 
the revenues  expenses  cash flows and other assumptions underlying the estimated fair value of the acquired in process research and development involve significant risks and uncertainties 
the risks and uncertainties associated with completing the acquired in process projects include obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals in a timely manner and being able to successfully and profitably produce  distribute and sell products 
in may  we purchased from bayer cropscience its interest in agrinomics llc  our joint venture with bayer cropscience  in exchange for releasing bayer cropscience from all future obligations under the joint venture agreement 
we recorded the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition  as determined by management based on valuation techniques in accordance with gaap 
as a result  we recorded net tangible liabilities of million  intangible assets of million and expense associated with the purchase of in process research and development of million  representing the fair value of two primary research projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and that have no alternative future use 
this transaction is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents amortization of intangible assets total amortization of intangible assets and dollar and percentage changes as compared to the prior year are as follows dollar amounts are presented in millions year ended december  amortization of intangible assets dollar increase decrease percentage increase decrease intangible assets result from our acquisitions of x ceptor  genomica  artemis and agritope renamed exelixis plant sciences 
the increase in as compared to was due to approximately two months of amortization related to the million in assembled workforce related to the x ceptor acquisition 
the amortization expense for and was consistent because the intangible assets were comprised of the same items for both periods 
restructuring charges during the second quarter of  we implemented a restructuring and consolidation of our research and discovery organizations designed to optimize our ability to generate multiple new  high quality investigational new drug applications per year and rapidly advance these new drug candidates through clinical development 
the restructuring included a reduction in force of employees  the majority of which were research personnel located in south san francisco  california 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million during the year ended december   comprised of involuntary termination benefits 
we do not expect to record any material expenses related to this restructuring in future periods 
during the third quarter of  we implemented a restructuring of our research and development organization designed to reallocate resources and enhance the efficiency of our operations 
the restructuring included a reduction in force of research personnel located in south san francisco  california and t bingen  germany  closure of our t bingen facility and relocation of certain research activities and employees from t bingen to south san francisco 
the restructuring plan was substantially complete as of march  in connection with this restructuring plan  we recorded a cumulative charge of approximately million to date in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  of which approximately million was recorded during this charge consists primarily of severance  retention bonuses  relocation  lease buyout costs and legal and outplacement services fees 
the restructuring charge also includes non cash activity  including an impairment of assets of approximately million and a gain on closure of our t bingen facility of approximately million related to the removal from equity of the cumulative currency translation adjustment attributable to the t bingen location 
we do not expect to record any additional expenses associated with this restructuring  as the restructuring plan is substantially complete 
during the fourth quarter of  we implemented a restructuring plan  which resulted in a reduction in workforce of employees primarily from our us research operations 
accordingly  we recorded a restructuring charge of million comprised primarily of involuntary termination benefits 
the restructuring plan was implemented in order to facilitate our evolution into a fully integrated drug discovery company and the reallocation of resources to permit greater focus on building our expanding portfolio of development programs 

table of contents other income expense  net total other income expense  net and dollar and percentage changes as compared to the prior year are as follows dollar amounts are presented in millions year ended december  other income expense  net dollar increase decrease percentage increase decrease other income expense  net consists primarily of interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  offset by interest expense incurred on our notes payable  bank obligations  capital lease obligations and convertible notes and loans 
the decrease in compared to was the result of increases in our notes payable  bank obligations and convertible loans 
our convertible loans increased by million during december and december in addition  our interest income has decreased due to an overall decline in our investment balances during the decrease in compared to was the result of a decrease in interest income due to an overall decline in interest rates coupled with an increase in interest expense related to an increase in notes payable and bank obligations 
discontinued operations in april  we transferred the genomica software business to visualize for contingent license fees and royalty payments 
pursuant to the terms of the transaction  visualize obtained a license with all rights and obligations to third parties currently licensing the genomica software  including the sole right to further develop and license the software to other third parties 
royalties that we receive  if any  will be recorded in the period they are earned as a gain in discontinued operations 
in addition  visualize assumed the lease obligation for genomica s abandoned facility in sacramento  california 
we retained an internal use license for the software 
as a result of this transaction  we reported the operating results of genomica and the estimated loss on the sale of genomica as discontinued operations 
income taxes we have incurred net losses since inception and  consequently  have not recorded any us federal or state income taxes 
as of december   we had federal and california net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had federal and california research and development credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
if not utilized  the net operating loss and credit carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in we recorded a tax provision of approximately million during the year ended december  related to income earned in our foreign operations 
due to a favorable outcome on a position we took with the german tax authorities  we reversed the tax provision in we do not expect to pay income taxes on our foreign operations for the years ended december  or under the internal revenue code and similar state provisions  certain substantial changes in our ownership could result in an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss and credit carryforwards that can be utilized in future years to offset future taxable income 
annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating loss and credit carryforwards before they are used 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash requirements to date  we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity  payments and loans from collaborators  equipment financing facilities and interest income 
in addition  we acquired genomica in december  including its million in cash and investments 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash and investments 
we have incurred net losses since inception  including a net loss of approximately million for the year ended december   and expect to incur substantial losses for at least the next several years as we continue our research and development activities  which include manufacturing and development expenses for our compounds in pre clinical and clinical studies 
we anticipate that our current cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and funding that we expect to receive from collaborators will enable us to maintain our currently planned operations for at least the next months 
it is possible that we will seek additional financing within this timeframe through public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
changes to our current operating plan may require us to consume available capital resources significantly sooner than we expect 
our future capital requirements will be substantial and will depend on many factors  including payments received under collaborative agreements  licensing agreements and other arrangements  the progress and scope of our collaborative and independent clinical trials and other research and development projects  future clinical trial results  our need to expand our product and clinical development efforts  our ability to share the costs of clinical development efforts with third parties  including clinical development costs we intend to offload through financing vehicles or by partnering with other companies  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost of establishing clinical and research supplies of our product candidates  our ability to remain in compliance with  or amend or cause to be waived  financial covenants contained in loan and lease agreements with third parties  the effect of competing technological and market developments  the filing  maintenance  prosecution  defense and enforcement of patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the cost of any acquisitions of or investments in businesses  products and technologies  although we currently have no commitments relating to any such transactions  and the cost and timing of establishing or contracting for sales  marketing and distribution capabilities 
if our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds 
we currently have a shelf registration statement on file with the sec that allows us to sell common stock from time to time 
in addition  we have a universal shelf registration on file with the sec that allows us to sell from time to time common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and warrants  either individually or in units 
however  we may be unable to raise sufficient additional capital when we need it  on favorable terms or at all 
the sale of equity or convertible debt securities in the future may be dilutive to our stockholders  and debt 
table of contents financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets and enter into covenants that would restrict certain business activities or our ability to incur further indebtedness and may contain other terms that are not favorable to our stockholders or us 
if we are unable to obtain adequate funds on reasonable terms  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or obtain funds by entering into financing  supply or collaboration agreements on unattractive terms 
we have contractual obligations in the form of operating and capital leases  notes payable and licensing agreements 
these are described in further detail in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following chart details our contractual obligations in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years minimum purchase obligations notes payable and bank obligations licensing agreements capital lease obligations convertible promissory note and loan operating leases total contractual cash obligations sources and uses of cash our operating activities used cash of million for the year ended december   compared to million for and million for cash used in operating activities during relates primarily to funding net losses and changes in deferred revenue from collaborators and accrued merger and acquisition costs  partially offset by non cash charges related to acquired in process research and development  depreciation and amortization of intangibles 
cash used in operating activities during relates primarily to funding net losses and changes in deferred revenue from collaborators  partially offset by non cash charges related to depreciation and amortization of deferred stock compensation and intangibles 
the increase of million in cash used by our operating activities for as compared to was primarily driven by our increase in net loss  less acquired in process research and development expenses 
the increase of million in cash used by our operating activities for as compared to was primarily driven by the increase in deferred revenue during due to payments received under our collaboration agreements 
we expect to use cash for operating activities for at least the next several years as we continue to incur net losses associated with our research and development activities  including manufacturing and development expenses for compounds in preclinical and clinical studies 
our investing activities provided cash of million for the year ended december  compared to cash used by investing activities of million for and cash provided by investing activities of million for changes in cash from investing activities for  and are primarily due to purchases  sales and maturities of short term investments  changes in restricted cash and purchases of property and equipment 
the increase in cash provided by investing activities for as compared to and the decrease in as compared to is primarily driven the change in the purchases of short terms investments as compared to the proceeds from maturities and the sale of short term investments 
we expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development and our administrative infrastructure  including the purchase of property and equipment to support our expanding drug discovery and development operations 
our financing activities provided cash of million for the year ended december   compared to million for and million for changes in cash from financing activities for  and are attributable to loans from collaborators  issuance of common stock and payments and proceeds 
table of contents associated with equipment financing facilities 
the decrease of million in cash provided by our financing activities for as compared to was primarily driven by the follow on public offering of approximately million shares of registered common stock  resulting in net proceeds of million that was completed in the increase of million in cash provided by our financing activities for as compared to was also primarily driven by the net proceeds of million from the follow on completed in in december  we exercised our option to draw the remaining million available to us under the glaxosmithkline loan facility  bringing the total amount drawn to million 
we finance property and equipment purchases through equipment financing facilities  such as capital leases  notes and bank obligations 
proceeds from collaboration loans and common stock issuances are used for general working capital purposes  such as research and development activities  merger and acquisition expenses and other general corporate purposes 
over the next several years  we are required to make certain payments on capital leases  notes  bank obligations and loans from collaborators 
these contractual obligations are described in further detail in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements and are included in the contractual obligation chart located above in the cash requirements section of management s discussion and analysis 
in january  glaxosmithkline acquired million shares of our common stock  resulting in proceeds of million 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or annual period after june   with early adoption encouraged 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we will be required to adopt sfas r in the third quarter of fiscal  beginning july  under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive option  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
we are evaluating the requirements of sfas r and expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
we have not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas r  and we have not determined whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined by applicable sec regulations that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources other than those described below 
these are described in further detail in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
genoptera in december  we formed genoptera llc with bayer corporation to focus on developing insecticides and nematicides for crop protection 
under the terms of the genoptera operating agreement  bayer provides of the capital necessary to fund the operations of genoptera and has the ability to control the entity with a 
table of contents ownership interest 
we own the other interest in genoptera without making any capital contribution and report the investment in genoptera using the equity method of accounting 
bayer s initial capital contributions to genoptera were million in january and another million in january bayer is also required to contribute cash to genoptera in amounts necessary to fund its ongoing operating expenses 
genoptera has incurred losses since inception 
since our carrying value of this investment is zero and there is no obligation to fund future losses  we have not recorded equity method losses for genoptera to date 
revenues recognized under this joint venture approximated  and of our total consolidated revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long term debt 
at december   and  we had investments of approximately million and million  respectively 
our investments are subject to interest rate risk  and our interest income may fluctuate due to changes in us interest rates 
by policy  we limit our investments to money market instruments  debt securities of us government agencies and debt obligations of us corporations 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of estimated tax 
we manage market risk by our diversification requirements  which limit the amount of our portfolio that can be invested in a single issuer 
we manage credit risk by limiting our purchases to high quality issuers 
through our money managers  we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate risk 
the risk management control systems use analytical techniques  including sensitivity analysis 
at december   and  we had long term debt and capital leases outstanding of approximately million and million  respectively 
our payment commitments associated with these debt instruments are fixed during the corresponding terms and are comprised of interest payments  principal payments or a combination thereof 
the fair value of our long term debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates  increasing in periods of declining rates of interest  and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest 
we have estimated the effects on our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities based on a one percentage point hypothetical adverse change in interest rates as of december  and as of december  and  a decrease in the interest rates of one percentage point would have had a net adverse change in the fair value of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities of approximately million and million  respectively 
it is assumed the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risks 
significant variations in market interest rates could produce changes in the timing of repayments due to available prepayment options 
the fair value of such instruments could be affected and  therefore  actual results might differ from our estimate 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to the operations of our german subsidiary artemis 
the revenues and expenses of our german subsidiary are denominated in euro 
at the end of each reporting period  the revenues and expenses of these subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using the average currency rate in effect for the period  and assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period 
fluctuations in exchange rates  therefore  impact our financial condition and results of operations as reported in us dollars
