item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition and liquidity 
products are transported in liquid form from the upper texas gulf coast through two parallel underground pipelines that extend to seymour  indiana 
from seymour  segments of the products pipeline system extend to the chicago  illinois  lima  ohio  selkirk  new york  and philadelphia  pennsylvania  areas 
the products pipeline system east of todhunter  ohio  is dedicated solely to lpgs transportation and storage services  primarily for propane 
excluding the storage facilities of centennial and mb storage  the products pipeline system includes storage facilities with an aggregate storage capacity of million barrels of refined petroleum products and million barrels of lpgs  including storage capacity leased to outside parties 
the products pipeline system makes deliveries to customers at locations including truck racks  rail car facilities and marine facilities that we own 
deliveries to other pipelines occur at various facilities owned by te products or by third parties 
the products pipeline system is comprised of a inch diameter line extending in a generally northeasterly direction from baytown  texas located approximately miles east of houston  to a point in southwest ohio near lebanon and todhunter 
a second line  which also originates at baytown  is inches in diameter until it reaches beaumont  at which point it reduces to a inch diameter line 
this second line extends along the same path as the inch diameter line to the products pipeline system s terminal in el dorado  arkansas  before continuing as a inch diameter line to seymour 
the products pipeline system also has smaller diameter lines that extend laterally from el dorado to helena  arkansas  from shreveport  louisiana  to el dorado and from mcrae  arkansas  to west memphis  arkansas 
the line from el dorado to helena has a inch diameter 
the line from shreveport to el dorado varies in diameter from inches to inches 
the line from mcrae to west memphis has a inch diameter 
the products pipeline system also includes a inch diameter line from seymour to chicago  illinois  and a inch diameter line running from lebanon to lima  ohio 
this inch diameter pipeline connects to the buckeye pipe line company system that serves  among others  markets in michigan and eastern ohio 
the products pipeline system also has a inch diameter pipeline connection to the greater cincinnati northern kentucky international airport and an inch diameter pipeline connection to the george bush intercontinental airport terminal in houston 
in addition  the products pipeline system contains numerous lines  ranging in size from inches to inches in diameter  associated with the gathering and distribution system  extending from baytown to beaumont  texas city to baytown  pasadena  texas  to baytown and baytown to mont belvieu 
the products pipeline system continues eastward from todhunter  ohio  to greensburg  pennsylvania  at which point it branches into two segments  one ending in selkirk  new york near albany  and the other ending at marcus hook  pennsylvania near philadelphia 
the products pipeline system east of todhunter and ending in selkirk is an inch diameter line  and the line starting at greensburg and ending at marcus hook varies in diameter from inches to inches 
in  we increased the delivery capability between todhunter  ohio  and coshocton  ohio  by  to  barrels per day and increased storage and improved loading capability at oneonta  new york 
in  we also completed a phase ii project to further extend beyond coshocton our delivery capacity of lpgs to the northeast by  to  barrels per day 
the phase ii expansion included the construction of three pump stations between coshocton and greensburg  pennsylvania  and two stations from greensburg to watkins glen  new york 
additional work on the pipeline segment between greensburg and philadelphia  pennsylvania  to increase delivery rates to the philadelphia area has been completed 
improvements were also completed during the fourth quarter of at our dubois  pennsylvania  terminal  and additional improvements are expected to be completed during the first quarter of at our eagle  pennsylvania  terminal 
te products also owns three inch diameter common carrier petrochemical pipelines between mont belvieu and port arthur 
each of these pipelines is approximately miles in length 
the pipelines transport ethylene  propylene and natural gasoline 
we entered into a year agreement in with a major petrochemical producer for guaranteed throughput commitments 
during the years ended december    and  we recognized million  million and million  respectively  of revenue under the throughput and deficiency contract 
our downstream segment also includes the operations of the northern portion of the dean pipeline 
beginning in january  the northern portion of the dean pipeline was converted to transport rgp from mont belvieu to point comfort 
the northern portion of the dean pipeline consists of miles of pipeline from mont belvieu to point comfort 
we believe that our products pipeline system is in compliance with applicable federal  state and local laws and regulations and accepted industry standards and practices 
we perform regular maintenance on all of the facilities of the products pipeline system and have an ongoing process of inspecting the products pipeline system and making repairs and replacements when necessary or appropriate 
in addition  we conduct periodic air patrols of the products pipeline system to monitor pipeline integrity and third party right of way encroachments 
major business sector markets our major operations in the downstream segment consist of the transportation  storage and terminaling of refined petroleum products and lpgs along our mainline system 
product deliveries  in millions of barrels mmbbls on a regional basis  for the years ended december   and  were as follows years ended december  refined products mainline transportation central midwest ohio and kentucky subtotal lpgs mainline transportation central  midwest and kentucky ohio and northeast subtotal total mainline transportation petrochemical transportation total product deliveries arkansas  louisiana  missouri and texas 
illinois and indiana 
new york and pennsylvania 
includes dean north rgp volumes 
petrochemical transportation between mont belvieu and port arthur  texas  has not been included as those volumes are with one customer 
the mix of products delivered varies seasonally 
gasoline demand is generally stronger in the spring and summer months and lpgs demand is generally stronger in the fall and winter months 
weather and economic conditions in the geographic areas served by our products pipeline system also affect the demand for  and the mix of  the products delivered 
refined products and lpgs deliveries in mmbbls for the years ended december   and  were as follows years ended december  refined products mainline transportation gasoline jet fuels distillates subtotal lpgs mainline transportation propane butanes subtotal total mainline transportation petrochemical transportation total product deliveries primarily diesel fuel  heating oil and other middle distillates 
refined products mainline transportation our products pipeline system transports refined petroleum products from the upper texas gulf coast  eastern texas and southern arkansas to the central and midwest regions of the united states with deliveries in texas  louisiana  arkansas  missouri  illinois  kentucky  indiana and ohio 
at these points  refined petroleum products are delivered to terminals owned by te products  connecting pipelines and customer owned terminals 
the volume of refined petroleum products transported by our products pipeline system is directly affected by the demand for refined products in the geographic regions that our system serves 
this market demand varies based upon the different end uses to which the refined products deliveries are applied 
demand for gasoline  which accounted for approximately of the volume of refined products transported through the products pipeline system during  depends upon price  prevailing economic conditions and demographic changes in the markets that we serve 
demand for distillates is affected by truck and railroad freight  the price of natural gas used by utilities  which use distillates as a substitute for natural gas when the price of natural gas is high  and usage for agricultural operations  which is affected by weather conditions  government policy and crop prices 
demand for jet fuel depends upon prevailing economic conditions and military usage 
market prices for refined petroleum products affect the demand in the markets served by our downstream segment 
therefore  quantities and mix of products transported may vary 
transportation tariffs of refined petroleum products vary among specific product types 
as a result  market price volatility may affect transportation volumes and revenues from period to period 
lpgs mainline transportation our products pipeline system transports lpgs from the upper texas gulf coast to the central  midwest and northeast regions of the united states 
the products pipeline system east of todhunter  ohio  is devoted solely to the transportation of lpgs 
because propane demand is generally sensitive to weather in the winter months  year to year variations of propane deliveries have occurred and will likely continue to occur 
our products pipeline system also transports normal butane and isobutane in the midwest and northeast for use in the production of motor gasoline 
our ability in the downstream segment to serve propane markets in the northeast is enhanced by our marine import terminal at providence 
this facility includes a  barrel refrigerated storage tank along with ship unloading and truck loading facilities 
effective may  we entered into an agreement with an affiliate of defs to commit to it sole utilization of our providence terminal 
we operate the terminal and provide propane loading services to an affiliate of defs 
the agreement was renegotiated in may during the years ended december    and  revenues of million  million and million  respectively  from an affiliate of defs were recognized pursuant to this agreement 
other operating revenues our downstream segment also earns revenue from terminaling activities and other ancillary services associated with the transportation and storage of refined petroleum products and lpgs 
from time to time  we sell excess product inventory 
other operating revenues include revenues related to the intrastate transportation of petrochemicals under a throughput and deficiency contract 
customers our customers for the transportation of refined petroleum products include major integrated oil companies  independent oil companies  the airline industry and wholesalers 
end markets for these deliveries are primarily retail service stations  truck stops  railroads  agricultural enterprises  refineries and military and commercial jet fuel users 
propane customers include wholesalers and retailers who  in turn  sell to commercial  industrial  agricultural and residential heating customers  as well as utilities who use propane as a back up fuel source 
refineries constitute our major customers for butane and isobutane  which are used as a blend stock for gasolines and as a feed stock for alkylation units  respectively 
at december   our downstream segment had approximately customers 
during the year ended december   total revenues and percentage of total revenues attributable to the top customers were million  of which marathon ashland petroleum llc accounted for approximately of total downstream segment revenues 
during the year ended december   total revenues and percentage of total revenues attributable to the top customers were million  of which marathon ashland petroleum llc accounted for approximately of total downstream segment revenues 
during the year ended december   total revenues and percentage of total revenues attributable to the top customers were million 
during the year ended december   no single customer accounted for or more of total downstream segment s revenues 
during each of the three years ended december   and  no single customer of the downstream segment accounted for or more of total consolidated revenues 
credit policies and procedures we manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis  credit approvals  credit limits and monitoring procedures 
we utilize letters of credit and guarantees for certain of our receivables 
however  these procedures and policies do not fully eliminate customer credit risk 
during the year ended december   we expensed a minimal amount of uncollectible receivables of the downstream segment 
during the years ended december  and  a few small to medium sized customers of the downstream segment filed for bankruptcy protection  and as a result  we expensed approximately million and million  respectively  of uncollectible receivables of the downstream segment related to customer bankruptcies or other non payments 
competition the products pipeline system conducts operations without the benefit of exclusive franchises from government entities 
interstate common carrier transportation services are provided through the system pursuant to tariffs filed with the ferc 
because pipelines are generally the lowest cost method for intermediate and long haul overland movement of refined petroleum products and lpgs  the products pipeline system s most significant competitors other than indigenous production in its markets are pipelines in the areas where the products pipeline system delivers products 
competition among common carrier pipelines is based primarily on transportation charges  quality of customer service and proximity to end users 
we believe our downstream segment is competitive with other pipelines serving the same markets  however  comparison of different pipelines is difficult due to varying product mix and operations 
trucks  barges and railroads competitively deliver products in some of the areas served by the products pipeline system 
trucking costs  however  render that mode of transportation less competitive for longer hauls or larger volumes 
barge fees for the transportation of refined products are generally lower than te products tariffs 
we face competition from rail movements of lpgs from sarnia  ontario  canada  and waterborne imports into new hampshire

upstream segment gathering  transportation  marketing and storage of crude oil operations we conduct business in our upstream segment through the following tctm  teppco crude pipeline  lp tcpl  teppco crude oil  lp tco and lubrication services  lp lsi  wholly owned subsidiaries of tctm  and our owned equity investment in seaway crude pipeline company seaway 
our upstream segment gathers  transports  markets and stores crude oil  and distributes lubrication oils and specialty chemicals  principally in oklahoma  texas  new mexico and the rocky mountain region 
we commenced our upstream segment business in connection with the acquisition of assets from an affiliate of defs in november our upstream segment uses its asset base to aggregate crude oil and provide transportation and specialized services to its regional customers 
our upstream segment purchases crude oil from various producers and operators at the wellhead and makes bulk purchases of crude oil at pipeline and terminal facilities 
the crude oil is then sold to refiners and other customers 
the upstream segment transports crude oil through equity owned pipelines  its trucking operations and third party pipelines 
margins in the upstream segment  as used throughout this report  are calculated as revenues generated from the sale of crude oil and lubrication oil  and transportation of crude oil  less the costs of purchases of crude oil and lubrication oil 
margins are a more meaningful measure of financial performance than sales and purchases of crude oil and lubrication oil due to the significant fluctuations in sales and purchases caused by variations in the level of volumes marketed and prices for products marketed see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations upstream segment for margin and volume information 
additionally  we use margin internally to evaluate the financial performance of the upstream segment as we believe margin is a better indicator of performance than operating income as operating  general and administrative expenses  operating fuel and power and depreciation expense are not directly related to the margin activities 
tco purchases crude oil and simultaneously establishes a margin by selling crude oil for physical delivery to third party users 
we seek to maintain a balanced marketing position until we make physical delivery of the crude oil  thereby minimizing or eliminating our exposure to price fluctuations occurring after the initial purchase 
however  certain basis risks  which are the risks that price relationships between delivery points  classes of products or delivery periods will change  cannot be completely hedged or eliminated 
risk management policies have been established by the risk management committee to monitor and control market risks 
the risk management committee is comprised  in part  of certain senior executives of the company

line transfers  pumpovers and other our upstream segment provides trade documentation services to its customers  primarily at cushing and midland 
tcpl documents the transfer of crude oil in its terminal facilities between contracting buyers and sellers 
this line transfer documentation service is related to the trading activity by tcpl s customers of nymex open interest crude oil contracts and other physical trading activity 
this service provides a documented record of receipts  deliveries and transactions to each customer  including confirmation of trade matches  inventory management and scheduled movements 
line transfer revenues are included as part of other operating revenues in our consolidated statements of income 
the line transfer services also attract physical barrels to tcpl s facilities for final delivery to the ultimate owner 
a pumpover occurs when the last title transfer is executed and the physical barrels are delivered out of tcpl s custody 
tcpl owns and operates storage facilities primarily in midland and cushing with an operational capacity of approximately million barrels to facilitate the pumpover business 
revenues from pumpover services are included as part of crude oil transportation revenues in our consolidated statements of income and represent the crude oil terminaling component

valero accounted for  and  respectively  of the upstream gross sales revenue 
for each of the years ended december   and  valero accounted for of our total consolidated revenues 
competition the most significant competitors in pipeline operations in our upstream segment are primarily common carrier and proprietary pipelines owned and operated by major oil companies  large independent pipeline companies and other companies in the areas where our pipeline systems deliver crude oil 
competition among common carrier pipelines is based primarily on posted tariffs  quality of customer service  knowledge of products and markets  and proximity to refineries and connecting pipelines 
the crude oil gathering and marketing business is characterized by thin margins and intense competition for supplies of crude oil at the wellhead 
declines in domestic crude oil production have intensified competition among gatherers and marketers 
a significant portion of the growth in our upstream segment has occurred through acquisitions of pipeline gathering systems 
our acquisitions in this segment have provided increased efficiencies for the gathering and transportation of crude oil with our existing pipeline systems as well as expansion into new market areas 
we experience competition from other gatherers and marketers in bidding for potential acquisitions 
within the past few years  the number of companies involved in the gathering of crude oil in the united states has decreased as a result of business consolidations and bankruptcies  which may decrease the number of potential acquisitions of crude gathering systems available to us 
credit policies and procedures as crude oil or lubrication oils are marketed or transported  we must determine the amount  if any  of credit to be extended to any given customer 
due to the nature of individual sales transactions  risk of non payment and non performance by customers is a major consideration in our business 
we manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis  credit approvals  credit limits and monitoring procedures 
we utilize letters of credit and guarantees for certain of our receivables 
however  these procedures and policies do not fully eliminate customer credit risk 
during the years ended december  and  we expensed approximately million and million  respectively  of uncollectible receivables of the upstream segment 
during the year ended december   no additional reserves were necessary for uncollectible receivables of the upstream segment

at december   the midstream segment had approximately customers 
revenue attributable to the top customers was million for the year ended december   of which defs and its affiliates  encana corporation and burlington resources inc accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of revenues of the midstream segment 
during each of the three years ended december   and  no single customer of the midstream segment accounted for or more of total consolidated revenues 
credit policies and procedures we manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis  credit approvals  credit limits and monitoring procedures 
we utilize letters of credit and guarantees for certain of our receivables 
however  these procedures and policies do not fully eliminate customer credit risk 
during the years ended december   and  no additional reserves were necessary for uncollectible receivables of the midstream segment 
in december  we expensed approximately million of uncollected transportation deficiency revenues due to the bankruptcy of enron corp 
and certain of its subsidiaries  which occurred in december during the second quarter of  we sold our enron corp 
receivable and received million 
competition the most significant competition for the ngl pipeline operations of our midstream segment comes from proprietary pipelines owned and operated by major oil and gas companies and other large independent pipeline companies with contiguous operations 
the ability to compete in the ngl pipeline area is based primarily on the quality of customer service and knowledge of products and markets 
the majority of the recent growth in the midstream segment is due to the acquisition and expansions of jonah in the green river basin in southwestern wyoming and the acquisition of val verde in the san juan basin in new mexico and colorado 
typically  new supplies of natural gas are necessary to offset the natural declines in production from wells connected to any gathering system 
the jonah and pinedale fields that are the focus of the jonah system in wyoming are both relatively young producing areas  characterized by long lived production profiles with many years of significant growth potential ahead 
competition in the natural gas gathering operations of our midstream segment is based largely on reputation  efficiency  system reliability and system capacity 
key competitors in the gathering and treating segment include independent gas gatherers as well as other major integrated energy companies 
alternate gathering facilities may be available to producers served by our midstream segment  and those producers could also elect to construct proprietary gas gathering systems 
success in the gas gathering and treating business segment is based primarily on a thorough understanding of the needs of the producers served  as well as a strong commitment to providing responsive  high quality customer service 
if the production ultimately delivered to one of our gathering systems declines  revenues from such operations would also be adversely affected 
if these declines are sustained or substantial  we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
financial information about the midstream segment see note segment information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for financial information about the midstream segment 
title to properties we believe we have satisfactory title to all of our assets 
the properties are subject to liabilities in certain cases  such as customary interests generally contracted in connection with acquisition of the properties  liens for taxes not yet due  easements  restrictions and other minor encumbrances 
we believe none of these liabilities materially affect the value of our properties or our interest in the properties or will materially interfere with their use in the operation of our business 
capital expenditures capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  totaled million for the year ended december  revenue generating projects include those projects which expand service into new markets or expand capacity into current markets 
capital expenditures to sustain existing operations include projects required by regulatory agencies or required life cycle replacements 
system upgrade projects improve operational efficiencies or reduce cost 
we capitalize interest costs incurred during the period that construction is in progress 
the following table identifies capital expenditures by segment for the year ended december  in millions revenue generating sustaining existing operations system upgrades capitalized interest total downstream segment midstream segment upstream segment other total revenue generating capital spending by the downstream segment totaled million and was used primarily for the expansion of our pipelines extending from seymour to indianapolis  indiana  further expansions of our northeast pipeline system and construction of a new truck loading terminal in bossier city  louisiana 
revenue generating capital spending by the midstream segment totaled million and was used primarily for the expansion of the jonah system  new connections to the red cedar and black hills gathering systems on the val verde system and additional well connections on both the jonah and val verde systems 
revenue generating capital spending by the upstream segment totaled million and was used primarily for the expansion of our south texas system and connections to various other production facilities and pipelines 
in order to sustain existing operations  we spent million for various downstream segment pipeline projects  million for the midstream segment and million for upstream segment facilities 
an additional million was spent on system upgrade projects among all of our business segments 
we estimate that capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  for will be approximately million which includes million of capitalized interest 
we expect to spend approximately million for revenue generating projects and facility improvements 
capital spending on revenue generating projects and facility improvements will include approximately million for the expansion of our downstream segment facilities 
we expect to spend million to expand our upstream segment pipelines and facilities in west texas and oklahoma and approximately million to expand our midstream segment assets  with further expansions on our jonah system 
we expect to spend approximately million to sustain existing operations  including life cycle replacements for equipment at various facilities and pipeline and tank replacements among all of our business segments 
we expect to spend approximately million to improve operational efficiencies and reduce costs among all of our business segments 
we continually review and evaluate potential capital improvements and expansions that would be complementary to our present business operations 
these expenditures can vary greatly depending on the magnitude of our transactions 
we may finance capital expenditures through internally generated funds  debt or the issuance of additional equity 
regulation our interstate common carrier pipeline operations are subject to rate regulation by the ferc under the provisions of the interstate commerce act  the energy policy act of and rules and orders promulgated thereunder 
ferc regulation requires that interstate petroleum products and crude oil pipeline rates be posted publicly and that these rates be just and reasonable and nondiscriminatory 
rates of interstate petroleum products and crude oil pipeline companies  like us  are currently regulated by the ferc primarily through an index methodology  which allows a pipeline to change its rates based on the change from year to year in the producer price index for finished goods ppi index 
effective as of february   ferc order on remand modified the ppi index from ppi to ppi 
on april   several shippers filed a petition in the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit the court  flying j 
inc  lion oil company  sinclair oil corporation and tesoro refining and marketing company vs 
federal energy regulatory commission  docket no 
 seeking a review of whether the ferc s adoption of the ppi index was reasonable and supported by the evidence 
on april   the court handed down a decision denying the shippers petition for review  stating the shippers failed to establish that any of ferc s methodological choices or combination of choices were both erroneous and harmful 
as an alternative to using the ppi index  interstate petroleum products and crude oil pipeline companies may elect to support rate filings by using a cost of service methodology  competitive market showings market based rates or agreements between shippers and petroleum products and crude oil pipeline companies that the rate is acceptable 
te products has been granted permission by the ferc to utilize market based rates for all of its refined products movements other than the little rock  arkansas  arcadia and shreveport arcadia  louisiana destination markets  which are currently subject to the ppi index 
with respect to lpg movements  te products uses the ppi index 
all interstate transportation movements of crude oil by tcpl are subject to the ppi index as are the ngl interstate transportation movements on the chaparral ngl system 
on march   an initial decision in arco products co  et al 
v 
sfpp  docket or  et al 
was issued by the ferc  which made several significant determinations with respect to finding changed circumstances under the energy policy act of ep act 
the decision largely clarifies  but does not fully quantify  the standard required for a complainant to demonstrate that an oil pipeline s rates are no longer subject to the rate protection of the ep act by demonstrating that a substantial change in circumstances has occurred since with respect to the basis of the rates being challenged 
in the decision  the ferc found that a limited number of rate elements will significantly affect the economic basis for a pipeline company s rates 
the elements identified in the decision are volume changes  allowed total return and total cost of service including major cost elements of rate base such as tax rates and tax allowances  among others 
the ferc did reject  however  the use of changes in tax rate and income tax allowances as standalone factors 
it appears likely that the decision will be appealed 
we have not yet determined the impact  if any  that the decision  if it is ultimately upheld  would have on our rates if they were reviewed under the criteria of this decision 
on july   the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit issued an opinion in bp west coast producers llc v 
ferc 
in reviewing a series of orders involving sfpp  lp the court held among other things that the ferc had not adequately justified its policy of providing an oil pipeline limited partnership with an income tax allowance equal to the proportion of its limited partnership interests owned by corporate partners 
under the ferc s initial ruling  sfpp  lp was permitted an income tax allowance on its cost of service filing for of the net operating pre tax income expected from operations and was denied an income tax allowance equal to of its limited partnership interests that were held by non corporate partners 
the court remanded the case back to the ferc for further review 
as a result of the court s remand  the ferc on december   issued a request for comments seeking comments on whether the court s ruling applies only to the specific facts of the sfpp  lp proceeding or also extends to other capital structures involving partnerships and other forms of ownership 
the ultimate outcome of the ferc s inquiry on income tax allowance should not affect our current rates and rate structure because our rates are not based on cost of service methodology 
however  the outcome of the income tax allowance would become relevant to us should we i elect in the future to use cost of service to support our rates  or ii be required to use such methodology to defend our indexed rates 
the natural gas gathering operations of the jonah and val verde systems are exempt from ferc regulation under the natural gas act of since they are intrastate gas gathering systems rather than interstate transmission pipelines 
however  the ferc regulation still significantly affects the midstream segment  directly or indirectly  by its influences on the parties that produce the natural gas gathered on the jonah and val verde systems 
in addition  in recent years  the ferc has pursued pro competition policies in its regulation of interstate natural gas pipelines 
if the ferc does not continue the pro competition policies as it considers pipeline rate case proposals  revisions to rules and policies that affect shipper rights of access to interstate natural gas transportation capacity or proposals by natural gas pipelines to allow natural gas pipelines to charge negotiated rates without rate ceiling limits  such policy changes could have an adverse effect on the gathering rates the midstream segment is able to charge in the future 
environmental matters our operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  imposition of injunctions delaying or prohibiting certain activities and the need to perform investigatory and remedial activities 
although we believe our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations  risks of significant costs and liabilities are inherent in pipeline operations  and we cannot assure you that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred 
moreover  it is possible that other developments  such as increasingly strict environmental laws and regulations and enforcement policies thereunder  and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from our operations  could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us 
we believe that changes in environmental laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows in the near term 
water the federal water pollution control act of  as renamed and amended as the clean water act cwa  and analogous state laws impose strict controls against the discharge of oil and its derivatives into navigable waters 
the cwa provides penalties for any discharges of petroleum products in reportable quantities and imposes substantial potential liability for the costs of removing petroleum or other hazardous substances 
state laws for the control of water pollution also provide varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities in the case of a release of petroleum or its derivatives in navigable waters or into groundwater 
spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent a petroleum tank release from impacting navigable waters 
contamination resulting from spills or releases of petroleum products is an inherent risk within the petroleum pipeline industry 
to the extent that groundwater contamination requiring remediation exists along our pipeline systems as a result of past operations  we believe any such contamination could be controlled or remedied without having a material adverse effect on our financial position  but such costs are site specific  and we cannot assure you that the effect will not be material in the aggregate 
the primary federal law for oil spill liability is the oil pollution act of opa  which addresses three principal areas of oil pollution prevention  containment and cleanup  and liability 
opa applies to vessels  offshore platforms and onshore facilities  including terminals  pipelines and transfer facilities 
in order to handle  store or transport oil  shore facilities are required to file oil spill response plans with the appropriate federal agency being either the united states coast guard  the united states department of transportation office of pipeline safety ops or the environmental protection agency epa 
numerous states have enacted laws similar to opa 
under opa and similar state laws  responsible parties for a regulated facility from which oil is discharged may be liable for removal costs and natural resource damages 
the epa has adopted regulations that require us to have permits in order to discharge certain storm water run off 
storm water discharge permits may also be required by certain states in which we operate 
these permits may require us to monitor and sample the storm water run off 
air emissions our operations are subject to the federal clean air act the clean air act and comparable state laws 
amendments to the clean air act  as well as recent or soon to be adopted changes to state implementation plans for controlling air emissions in regional  non attainment areas  may require our operations to incur future capital expenditures in connection with the addition or modification of existing air emission control equipment and strategies 
in addition  some of our facilities are included within the categories of hazardous air pollutant sources  which are subject to increasing regulation under the clean air act 
the clean air act requires federal operating permits for major sources of air emissions 
under this program  a federal operating permit a title v permit may be issued 
the permit acts as an umbrella that includes other federal  state and local preconstruction and or operating permit provisions  emission standards  grandfathered rates and record keeping  reporting and monitoring requirements in a single document 
the federal operating permit is the tool that the public and regulatory agencies use to review and enforce a site s compliance with all aspects of clean air regulation at the federal  state and local level 
we have completed applications for the facilities for which these regulations apply 
risk management plans we are subject to the epa s risk management plan rmp regulations at certain locations 
this regulation is intended to work with the occupational safety and health act osha process safety management regulation see safety matters below to minimize the offsite consequences of catastrophic releases 
the regulation requires a regulated source  in excess of threshold quantities  to develop and implement a risk management program that includes a five year accident history  an offsite consequence analysis  a prevention program and an emergency response program 
we believe the operating expenses of the rmp regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
solid waste we generate hazardous and non hazardous solid wastes that are subject to requirements of the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes 
we also utilize waste minimization and recycling processes to reduce the volumes of our waste 
amendments to rcra required the epa to promulgate regulations banning the land disposal of all hazardous wastes unless the wastes meet certain treatment standards or the land disposal method meets certain waste containment criteria 
from time to time  the epa considers the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non hazardous wastes  including crude oil and gas wastes 
the adoption of such stricter standards for non hazardous wastes  or any future re designation of non hazardous wastes as hazardous wastes will likely increase our operating expenses as well as for the industry in general 
superfund the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  also known as superfund  imposes liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original act  on certain classes of persons who contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the owner or operator of a facility where a release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at a facility 
under cercla  these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment  for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies 
cercla also authorizes the epa and  in some instances  third parties to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover the costs they incur from the responsible classes of persons 
it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment 
in the course of our ordinary operations  our pipeline systems generate wastes that may fall within cercla s definition of a hazardous substance 
in the event a disposal facility previously used by us requires clean up in the future  we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which such wastes have been disposed 
other environmental proceedings in  the louisiana department of environmental quality ldeq issued a compliance order for environmental contamination at our arcadia  louisiana  facility 
in  our arcadia facility and adjacent terminals were directed by the remediation services division of the ldeq to pursue remediation of this contamination 
at december   we have an accrued liability of million for remediation costs at our arcadia facility 
effective in march  we executed an access agreement with an adjacent industrial landowner who is located upgradient of the arcadia facility 
this agreement enables the landowner to proceed with remediation activities at our arcadia facility for which it has accepted shared responsibility 
we do not expect that the completion of the remediation program proposed to the ldeq will have a future material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
on march   we experienced a release of barrels of jet fuel from a storage tank at our blue island terminal located in cook county  illinois 
as a result of the release  we have entered into an agreed order with the state of illinois  which required us to conduct an environmental investigation 
at this time  we have complied with the terms of the agreed order  and the results of the environmental investigation indicated there were no soil or groundwater impacts from the release 
we are in the process of negotiating a final settlement with the state of illinois  and we do not expect that compliance with the settlement will have a future material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
on july   we experienced a release of approximately barrels of jet fuel from a sump at our lebanon  ohio  terminal 
the released jet fuel was contained within a storm water retention pond located on the terminal property 
six migratory waterfowl were affected by the jet fuel and were subsequently euthanized by or at the request of the united states fish and wildlife service usfws 
on october   the usfws served us with a notice of violation  alleging that we violated usc of the migratory bird treaty act for the take 
ing 
of migratory birds by illegal methods 
on february   we entered into a memorandum of understanding with the usfws  settling all aspects of this matter 
the terms of this settlement did not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
on july   we received notice from the united states department of justice doj of its intent to seek a civil penalty against us related to our november   release of approximately  barrels of jet fuel from our inch diameter pipeline located in orange county  texas 
the doj  at the request of the epa  is seeking a civil penalty against us for alleged violations of the cwa arising out of this release 
the maximum statutory penalty calculated for this alleged violation of the cwa is million 
we are in discussions with the doj regarding this matter and have responded to its request for additional information 
we do not expect a civil penalty  if any  to have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
at december   we have an accrued liability of million  related to various tctm and te products sites requiring environmental remediation activities 
at december   we had an accrued liability of million related to various tctm sites requiring environmental remediation activities 
under the terms of a agreement through which we acquired various crude oil assets from dettco  we received a five year contractual indemnity obligation for certain environmental liabilities attributable to the operations of the assets prior to our acquisition 
concurrent with the expiration of this indemnity in  we entered into a settlement agreement and release with dettco releasing dettco from future obligations pertaining to certain environmental liabilities  requiring us to share in certain costs for the remediation of a crude oil site in oklahoma  and the assumption of responsibility by dettco for environmental liabilities associated with three sites located in texas and oklahoma 
we do not expect that the completion of remediation programs associated with tctm and te products activities will have a future material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
dot pipeline compliance matters we are subject to regulation by the united states department of transportation dot under the accountable pipeline and safety partnership act of  sometimes referred to as the hazardous liquid pipeline safety act hlpsa  and comparable state statutes relating to the design  installation  testing  construction  operation  replacement and management of our pipeline facilities 
the hlpsa covers petroleum and petroleum products and requires any entity that owns or operates pipeline facilities to comply with such regulations  to permit access to and copying of records and to file certain reports and provide information as required by the secretary of transportation 
the hlpsa was reauthorized in we believe that we are in material compliance with these hlpsa regulations 
we are subject to the dot regulation requiring qualification of pipeline personnel 
the regulation requires pipeline operators to develop and maintain a written qualification program for individuals performing covered tasks on pipeline facilities 
the intent of this regulation is to ensure a qualified work force and to reduce the probability and consequence of incidents caused by human error 
the regulation establishes qualification requirements for individuals performing covered tasks 
a written qualification program was completed in april  and our employees performing a covered task were qualified by the october deadline 
we believe that we are in material compliance with these dot regulations 
we are also subject to the dot integrity management regulations  which specify how companies with greater than miles of pipeline should assess  evaluate  validate and maintain the integrity of pipeline segments that  in the event of a release  could impact high consequence areas hca 
hca are defined as populated areas  unusually sensitive environmental areas and commercially navigable waterways 
the regulation requires the development and implementation of an integrity management program imp that utilizes internal pipeline inspection  pressure testing  or other equally effective means to assess the integrity of hca pipeline segments 
the regulation also requires periodic review of hca pipeline segments to ensure adequate preventative and mitigative measures exist and that companies take prompt action to address integrity issues raised by the assessment and analysis 
in compliance with these dot regulations  we identified our hca pipeline segments and developed an imp by the march  deadline 
the regulations require that initial hca baseline integrity assessments must be conducted within seven years  with all subsequent assessments conducted on a five year cycle 
additionally  of all hca pipeline miles must have been assessed by september  we exceeded this requirement by the imposed deadline 
in and  we continued with the baseline evaluation efforts initiated in and completed the assessment of approximately  and  miles  respectively  of our pipeline system 
in accordance with our imp program  we perform the appropriate repairs following each assessment 
safety matters we are also subject to the requirements of the federal osha and comparable state statutes 
we believe we are in material compliance with osha and state requirements  including general industry standards  record keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposures 
the osha hazard communication standard  the epa community right to know regulations under title iii of the federal superfund amendment and reauthorization act and comparable state statutes require us to organize and disclose information about the hazardous materials used in our operations 
certain parts of this information must be reported to employees  state and local governmental authorities and local citizens upon request 
we are subject to osha process safety management psm regulations  which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic  reactive  flammable or explosive chemicals 
these regulations apply to any process which involves a chemical at or above the specified thresholds or any process which involves a flammable liquid or gas  as defined in the regulations  stored on site in one location  in a quantity of  pounds or more 
we utilize certain covered processes and maintain storage of lpgs in pressurized tanks  caverns and wells  in excess of  pounds at various locations 
flammable liquids stored in atmospheric tanks below their normal boiling point without benefit of chilling or refrigeration are exempt 
we believe we are in material compliance with the osha regulations 
in general  we expect to increase our expenditures during the next decade to comply with stricter industry and regulatory safety standards such as those described above 
while such expenditures cannot be accurately estimated at this time  we do not believe that they will have a future material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

v 
texas eastern corporation  et al 
including the general partner and partnership and gilbert richards and jean richards v 
texas eastern corporation  et al 
including the general partner and partnership 
in both cases  the plaintiffs contend  among other things  that we and other defendants stored and disposed of toxic and hazardous substances and hazardous wastes in a manner that caused the materials to be released into the air  soil and water 
they further contend that the release caused damages to the plaintiffs 
in their complaints  the plaintiffs allege strict liability for both personal injury and property damage together with gross negligence  continuing nuisance  trespass  criminal mischief and loss of consortium 
the plaintiffs are seeking compensatory  punitive and treble damages 
on january   we entered into release and settlement agreements with the mccleery plaintiffs and the richards plaintiffs dismissing all of these plaintiffs claims 
the settlement terms include a million payment to the plaintiffs  which has been accrued for in our consolidated financial statements 
the terms of the settlements did not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

in may  the general partner was named as a defendant in a lawsuit styled john r 
james  et al 
v 
j graves insulation company  et al 
as filed in the first judicial district court  caddo parish  louisiana 
there are numerous plaintiffs identified in the action that are alleged to have suffered damages as the result of alleged exposure to asbestos containing products and materials 
according to the petition and as a result of a preliminary investigation  the general partner believes that the only claim asserted against it results from one individual for the period from july through june  who is alleged to have worked on a facility owned by the general partner s predecessor 
this period represents a small portion of the total alleged exposure period from january through december for this individual 
the individual s claims involve numerous employers and alleged job sites 
the general partner has been unable to confirm involvement by the general partner or its predecessors with the alleged location  and it is uncertain at this time whether this case is covered by insurance 
discovery is planned  and the general partner intends to defend itself vigorously against this lawsuit 
the plaintiffs have not stipulated the amount of damages that they are seeking in this suit 
we are obligated to reimburse the general partner for any costs it incurs related to this lawsuit

item submission of matters to a vote of security holders none 
part ii item market for registrant s units and related unitholder matters our units are listed and traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol tpp 
the high and low trading prices of our units in and  respectively  as reported in the new york times  were as follows quarter high low high low first second third fourth on february   the closing market price for our units was per unit 
based on the information received from our transfer agent and from brokers and nominees  we estimate the number of beneficial holders of our units as of february   to be approximately  the quarterly cash distributions for the years ended december  and  were as follows record date payment date amount per unit april  may  july  august  october  november  january  february  april  may  july  august  october  november  january  february  we make quarterly cash distributions of all of our available cash  generally defined as consolidated cash receipts less consolidated cash disbursements and cash reserves established by the general partner in its sole discretion 
pursuant to the partnership agreement  the company receives incremental incentive cash distributions when cash distributions exceed certain target thresholds see note partner s capital and distributions 
we are a publicly traded master limited partnership and are not subject to federal income tax

overview of business and results teppco partners  lp  a delaware limited partnership  is a publicly traded master limited partnership formed in march see items and business and properties general 
we operate and report in three business segments 
our downstream segment owns  operates or has investments in properties located in states  transports  stores and provides terminal services for petroleum products  transports lpgs in the mont belvieu area  transports petrochemicals in southeast texas and provides other ancillary services 
our upstream segment gathers  transports  markets and stores crude oil and distributes lubrication oils and specialty chemicals in oklahoma  texas  new mexico and the rocky mountain region 
our midstream segment gathers natural gas in the green river basin in southwestern wyoming and in the san juan basin in northwestern new mexico and southwestern colorado  transports ngls from southeastern new mexico  east texas and west texas to mont belvieu  texas  and fractionates ngls at two facilities in colorado 
we earn revenues and income and generate cash by charging our customers a fee for the transportation  storage  gathering  terminaling  fractionation and other services we provide 
in our upstream segment  we seek to maintain a balanced marketing position until we make physical delivery of the crude oil  thereby minimizing or eliminating our exposure to price fluctuations occurring after the initial purchase 
we are subject to economic and other factors that affect our industry 
the demand for refined products is dependent upon the price  prevailing economic conditions and demographic changes in the markets served  trucking and railroad freight  agricultural usage and military usage  the demand for propane is sensitive to the weather and prevailing economic conditions  the demand for petrochemicals is dependent upon prices for products produced from petrochemicals  the demand for crude oil and petroleum products is dependent upon the price of crude oil and the products produced from the refining of crude oil  and the demand for natural gas is dependent upon the price of natural gas and the locations in which natural gas is drilled 
we are also subject to regulatory factors such as the amounts we are allowed to charge our customers for the services we provide on our regulated pipeline systems 
certain factors are inherent in our business segments as discussed in this report 
these include the safe  reliable and efficient operation of the pipelines and facilities that we own or operate while meeting increased regulations that govern the operation of our assets and the costs associated with such regulations 
we are also focused on our continued growth through expansion of the assets that we own and through the acquisition of assets that complement our current operations 
our results illustrate the strength and diversity of our asset portfolio 
in  solid operating performance across all of our business segments contributed to a strong year for volumes  net income and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
our net income for the year ended december   was million  compared with million for the year ended december  we raised our annual distribution to our unitholders by per unit to an annualized rate of per unit at year end  continuing our twelve year track record of distribution increases 
distributions have increased approximately over the past five years 
our downstream segment had increased revenues from our refined products business and the recognition of million of deferred revenue  despite the impact of challenging market conditions for both our refined products and lpgs movements 
we have continued to utilize centennial s capacity in a manner that has provided additional delivery capability for our customers 
centennial has provided additional capacity through our lease agreement  enabling us to transport additional refined product volumes in during the third quarter of  centennial was able to transport jet fuel for the first time 
mb storage also continued its solid performance  in part due to storage and pipeline assets acquired in april these increases were partially offset by higher pipeline integrity expenses of million and an asset impairment charge of million related to a marine facility in beaumont  texas 
our upstream segment had a strong year  with increased transportation volumes and strong margins in our gathering and marketing business 
transportation volumes on our south texas system were higher than the prior year  primarily as a result of our november acquisition of the genesis assets 
we also had a record year for gallons delivered by lsi as a result of acquisitions of lubrication oil distributors in december and august these increases were partially offset by increased pipeline integrity expenses of million 
seaway had an outstanding year as well  with significant increases in long haul movements of crude oil 
our midstream segment benefited from increased volumes on jonah  resulting from our recent phase iii expansion  partially offset by the impact of reduced volumes on val verde primarily due to the natural decline of cbm production and slower than anticipated completion and connection of new wells 
our midstream segment was impacted by higher operating fuel and power costs  which increased million from primarily due to higher variable power rates and increased ngl volumes transported during times of peak power rates 
we ended in a solid financial position 
our operating costs overall were higher than expected  largely as a result of pipeline integrity expenses in our downstream and upstream segments 
the goal of our on going pipeline integrity program is to maintain the long term reliability and safety of our pipeline systems  while minimizing the impact to our customers 
our operating costs were also impacted by increased consulting and contract services of million related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of during the year  we spent million on revenue generating capital projects  which we believe will provide earnings  cash flow and growth opportunities 
we amended our revolving credit facility in october to i increase the facility size from million to million  ii extend the term to october   iii remove certain restrictive covenants  iv increase the available amount for the issuance of letters of credit up to million and v decrease the libor rate spread charged at the time of each borrowing 
we continued building a base for long term growth by enhancing existing systems and pursuing new business opportunities 
we increased throughput on our pipeline systems  constructed new pipeline and gathering systems  and expanded and upgraded our existing infrastructure 
among the highlights of during the fourth quarter of  we completed a phase ii project to further extend beyond coshocton  ohio  our delivery capacity of lpgs to the northeast by  to  barrels per day 
the phase ii expansion included the construction of three pump stations between coshocton and greensburg  pennsylvania  and two stations from greensburg to watkins glen  new york 
additional work on the pipeline segment between greensburg and philadelphia  pennsylvania  to increase delivery rates to the philadelphia area has been completed 
improvements were also completed during the fourth quarter of at our dubois  pennsylvania  terminal  and additional improvements are expected to be completed during the first quarter of at our eagle  pennsylvania  terminal 
mb storage acquired salt dome storage and lpgs pipeline assets in mont belvieu  texas  that will enable future expansion and provide a broader platform for growth 
we are in the process of constructing a new refined products truck loading terminal in bossier city  louisiana  to provide the shreveport  louisiana  and east texas markets with access to gulf coast sourced gasoline and diesel fuel 
this terminal is scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of we began an expansion project to increase delivery capacity of gasoline and diesel fuel to the indianapolis  indiana  and chicago  illinois market areas 
we are in the process of integrating a strategic mile pipeline segment from houston  texas  to katy  texas  to facilitate seaway s connectivity to gulf of mexico production and our south texas system 
in  we completed the integration of the genesis assets into our south texas system 
the million acquisition has strengthened our existing south texas market position and improved our physical asset base 
the basin system  which is a part of our upstream segment  was expanded between midland  texas  and wichita falls  texas  resulting in an additional capacity of ten thousand barrels per day on the system 
additional capacity of mmcf day by installing compression facilities on the jonah system was completed at a cost of approximately million 
the additional capacity will enable lower operating pressures in the jonah and pinedale fields  allowing for improved service and increased throughput 
we connected val verde to two new sources of natural gas production in southern colorado and northwest new mexico 
both connections will increase the utilization of the val verde assets by up to mmcf day 
we inspected more than  miles of pipeline and completed rehabilitation and enhancement work on an additional  miles of pipeline as part of our integrity management program 
we remain confident that our current strategy and focus will provide continued growth in earnings and cash distributions 
with respect to  these opportunities include continued solid performance in our upstream segment  as we build on our existing asset base and concentrate on acquisitions in our core operating areas  continued development of the jonah system which serves the jonah and pinedale fields  gathering of volumes from infill drilling of cbm by producers and new connections of conventional gas in the san juan basin  where our val verde system is located  growth in our downstream segment  resulting from our recent capacity expansion and grass roots facility investments and growing demand for gulf coast sourced products 
consistent with our business strategy  we continuously evaluate possible acquisitions of assets that would complement our current operations 
such acquisition efforts involve participation by us in processes that have been made public and involve a number of potential buyers  as well as situations in which we believe we are the only party or one of a very limited number of potential buyers in negotiations with the potential seller 
these acquisition efforts often involve assets which  if acquired  would have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
general we operate and report in three business segments downstream segment transportation and storage of refined products  lpgs and petrochemicals  upstream segment gathering  transportation  marketing and storage of crude oil and distribution of lubrication oils and specialty chemicals  and midstream segment gathering of natural gas  transportation of ngls and fractionation of ngls 
our reportable segments offer different products and services and are managed separately because each requires different business strategies 
teppco gp  our wholly owned subsidiary  acts as managing general partner of our operating partnerships  with a general partner interest and manages our subsidiaries 
our downstream segment revenues are earned from transportation and storage of refined products and lpgs  intrastate transportation of petrochemicals  sale of product inventory and other ancillary services 
the two largest operating expense items of the downstream segment are labor and electric power 
we generally realize higher revenues during the first and fourth quarters of each year since our operations are somewhat seasonal 
refined products volumes are generally higher during the second and third quarters because of greater demand for gasolines during the spring and summer driving seasons 
lpgs volumes are generally higher from november through march due to higher demand in the northeast for propane  a major fuel for residential heating 
our downstream segment also includes the results of operations of the northern portion of the dean pipeline  which transports rgp from mont belvieu to point comfort  texas 
our downstream segment also includes our equity investments in centennial and mb storage see note equity investments 
our upstream segment revenues are earned from gathering  transportation  marketing and storage of crude oil and distribution of lubrication oils and specialty chemicals  principally in oklahoma  texas  new mexico and the rocky mountain region 
marketing operations consist primarily of aggregating purchased crude oil along our pipeline systems  or from third party pipeline systems  and arranging the necessary transportation logistics for the ultimate sale of the crude oil to local refineries  marketers or other end users 
our upstream segment also includes our equity investment in seaway see note equity investments 
seaway consists of large diameter pipelines that transport crude oil from seaway s marine terminals on the us gulf coast to cushing  oklahoma  a crude oil distribution point for the central united states  and to refineries in the texas city and houston areas 
our midstream segment revenues are earned from the fractionation of ngls in colorado  transportation of ngls from two trunkline ngl pipelines in south texas  two ngl pipelines in east texas and a pipeline system chaparral from west texas and new mexico to mont belvieu  the gathering of natural gas in the green river basin in southwestern wyoming  through jonah  and the gathering of cbm and conventional natural gas in the san juan basin in new mexico and colorado  through val verde 
defs manages and operates the val verde  jonah and chaparral assets for us under contractual agreements 
the results of operations of the acquisitions are included in our consolidated financial statements in periods subsequent to their respective acquisition dates see note acquisitions and dispositions 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
such estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
although we believe that these estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant accounting policies that we employ are presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements see note summary of significant accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations 
these policies require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting policies pertain to revenue and expense accruals  environmental costs  property  plant and equipment and goodwill and intangible assets 
revenue and expense accruals we routinely make accruals based on estimates for both revenues and expenses due to the timing of compiling billing information  receiving certain third party information and reconciling our records with those of third parties 
the delayed information from third parties includes  among other things  actual volumes of crude oil purchased  transported or sold  adjustments to inventory and invoices for purchases and other operating expenses 
we make accruals to reflect estimates for these items based on our internal records and information from third parties 
most of the estimated accruals are reversed in the following month when actual information is received from third parties and our internal records have been reconciled 
the most difficult accruals to estimate are power costs  property taxes and crude oil margins 
power cost accruals generally involve a two to three month estimate  and the amount varies primarily for actual power usage 
power costs are dependent upon the actual volumes transported through our pipeline systems and the various power rates charged by numerous power companies along the pipeline system 
peak demand rates  which are difficult to predict  drive the variability of the power costs 
for the year ended december   approximately of our power costs are recorded using estimates 
a variance of in our aggregate estimate for power costs would have an approximate million impact on annual earnings 
property tax accruals involve significant tax rate estimates among numerous jurisdictions 
actual property taxes are often not known until the tax bill is settled in subsequent periods  and the tax amount can vary for tax rate changes and changes in tax methods or elections 
a variance of in our aggregate estimate for property taxes could have up to an approximate million impact on annual earnings 
crude oil margin estimates are based upon an average of the past twelve months of crude oil marketing volumes  factoring in current market events  and prices of crude oil 
we use an average of prices that were in effect during the applicable month to determine the expected revenue amount  and we determine the margin by evaluating the actual margins of the prior twelve months 
as of december   approximately of our annual crude oil margin is recorded using estimates 
a variance from this estimate of would impact the respective line items by approximately million on an annual basis 
although the resolution of these uncertainties has not historically had a material impact on our reported results of operations or financial condition  because of the high volume  low margin nature of our business  we cannot provide assurance that actual amounts will not vary significantly from estimated amounts 
variances from estimates are reflected in the period actual results become known  typically in the month following the estimate 
each of these accruals requires management s subjective judgments  requiring estimates regarding the effects of items that are inherently uncertain 
environmental costs at december   we have accrued a liability of million for our estimate of the future payments we expect to pay for environmental costs to remediate existing conditions attributable to past operations 
environmental costs include initial site surveys and environmental studies of potentially contaminated sites  costs for remediation and restoration of sites determined to be contaminated and ongoing monitoring costs  as well as damages and other costs  when estimable 
we monitor the balance of accrued undiscounted environmental liabilities on a regular basis 
we record liabilities for environmental costs at a specific site when our liability for such costs is probable and a reasonable estimate of the associated costs can be made 
adjustments to initial estimates are recorded  from time to time  to reflect changing circumstances and estimates based upon additional information developed in subsequent periods 
estimates of our ultimate liabilities associated with environmental costs are particularly difficult to make with certainty due to the number of variables involved  including the early stage of investigation at certain sites  the lengthy time frames required to complete remediation alternatives available and the evolving nature of environmental laws and regulations 
a variance of in our aggregate estimate for environmental costs would have an approximate million impact on annual earnings 
for information concerning environmental regulation and environmental costs and contingencies  see items and business and properties environmental matters 
property  plant and equipment we regularly review long lived assets for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of the carrying amount of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
estimates of future net cash flows include anticipated future revenues  expected future operating costs and other estimates 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired 
certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired including goodwill and other intangible assets as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit 
in addition  we assess the recoverability of these intangibles by determining whether the amortization of these intangibles over their remaining useful lives can be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows of the acquired operations 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured by the amount by which the carrying amounts exceed the projected discounted future operating cash flows 
during  we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which discontinues the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives and requires an annual test of impairment based on a comparison of fair value to carrying values 
the evaluation of impairment under sfas requires the use of projections  estimates and assumptions as to the future performance of the operations  including anticipated future revenues  expected future operating costs and the discount factor used 
actual results could differ from projections resulting in revisions to our assumptions and  if required  recognizing an impairment loss 
based on our assessment  we do not believe our goodwill is impaired  and we have not recorded a charge from the adoption of sfas see note goodwill and other intangible assets 
at december   the recorded value of goodwill and equity method goodwill was million and million  respectively 
in addition  we have million of excess investment in our equity investment in centennial  which is being accounted for as an intangible asset with an indefinite life 
at december   we have million of intangible assets related to natural gas transportation contracts which were recorded as part of our acquisitions of jonah on september   and val verde on june  see note acquisitions and dispositions 
the value assigned to the natural gas transportation contracts required management to make estimates regarding the fair value of the assets acquired 
in connection with the acquisition of jonah  we assumed contracts that dedicate future production from natural gas wells in the green river basin in wyoming 
we assigned million of the purchase price to these production contracts based upon a fair value appraisal at the time of the acquisition 
in connection with the acquisition of val verde  we assumed fixed term gas transportation contracts with customers in the san juan basin in new mexico and colorado 
we assigned million of the purchase price to these fixed term contracts based upon a fair value appraisal at the time of the acquisition 
the value assigned to intangible assets is amortized on a unit of production basis  based upon the actual throughput of the system over the expected total throughput for the lives of the contracts 
the amortization of the jonah and val verde systems are expected to average approximately years and years  respectively 
on a quarterly basis  we update throughput estimates and evaluate the remaining expected useful life of the contract assets based upon the best available information 
a variance of in our aggregate production estimate for the jonah and val verde systems would have an approximate million impact on annual earnings 
changes in the estimated remaining production will impact the timing of amortization expense reported for future periods

reductions in that demand adversely affect the pipeline business of the downstream segment 
market demand varies based upon the different end uses of the refined products shipped in the downstream segment 
demand for gasoline  which in recent years has accounted for approximately one half of the downstream segment s refined products transportation revenues  depends upon price  prevailing economic conditions and demographic changes in the markets served in the downstream segment 
demand for distillates is affected by truck and railroad freight  the price of natural gas used by utilities  which use distillates as a substitute for natural gas when the price of natural gas is high  and usage for agricultural operations  which is affected by weather conditions  government policy and crop prices 
demand for jet fuel  which in recent years has accounted for approximately one quarter of the downstream segment s refined products revenues  depends on prevailing economic conditions and military usage 
propane deliveries are generally sensitive to the weather and meaningful year to year variances have occurred in the past and will likely continue to occur in the future 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues from refined products transportation increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  refined products transportation revenues increased primarily due to higher market based tariff rates which went into effect in july and may and a shift in the distribution of product moved by us to favor longer haul  higher tariff movements 
these changes resulted in a increase in the refined products average rate per barrel from the prior year and offset the effect of a decrease in refined products delivery volumes 
in february  we entered into a lease agreement with centennial that increased our flexibility to deliver refined products to our market areas 
volumes transported on centennial increased due to increased demand and market share for products supplied from the us gulf coast into midwest markets 
centennial has provided our system with additional pipeline capacity for products originating in the us gulf coast area 
prior to the construction of centennial  deliveries on our pipeline system were limited by our pipeline capacity  and transportation services for our customers were allocated in accordance with a proration policy 
with this incremental pipeline capacity  our previously constrained system has expanded deliveries in markets both south and north of creal springs 
refined products transportation revenues also increased due to the recognition of million of deferred revenue related to the expiration of two customer transportation agreements 
under some of our transportation agreements with customers  the contracts specify minimum payments for transportation services 
if the transportation services paid for are not used  the unused transportation service is recorded as deferred revenue 
the contracts generally specify a subsequent period of time in which the customer can transport excess products to recover the amount recorded as deferred revenue 
during the third quarter of  the time limit under two transportation agreements expired without the customers recovering the unused transportation services 
as a result  we recognized the deferred revenue as refined products revenue in the current period 
this additional revenue increased the refined products average tariff for the year ended december   by per barrel  or 
revenues from lpgs transportation decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   due to lower deliveries of propane in the upper midwest and northeast market areas attributable to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of additionally  in late february  the mont belvieu propane price spiked  which resulted in teppco sourced propane being less competitive than propane from other source points 
also contributing to the decrease were less favorable price differentials between mont belvieu and other supply centers during the second and third quarters of high propane prices in also reduced the summer and early fall fill of consumer storage of propane during these decreases were partially offset by increased deliveries of isobutane to chicago area refineries and increased short haul propane deliveries to us gulf coast petrochemical customers 
the lpgs average rate per barrel decreased from the prior year period primarily as a result of increased short haul deliveries during other operating revenues increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to higher propane inventory fees  higher margins on product inventory sales  higher revenue from our providence  rhode island import facility and higher refined products tender deduction  loading and custody transfer revenues 
costs and expenses increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   due to increased operating  general and administrative expenses  increased depreciation and amortization expense and increased operating fuel and power  partially offset by net gains on the sales of assets 
operating  general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to a million increase in pipeline inspection and repair costs associated with our integrity management program  a million increase in legal accruals related to the settlement of a lawsuit see note commitments and contingencies  a million increase in rental expense from the centennial pipeline capacity lease agreement that we entered into in february  a million increase in consulting and contract services related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and a million increase in costs related to unsuccessful acquisition evaluations 
these increases were partially offset by million of lower expenses in the period associated with the write off of receivables related to customer bankruptcies and non payments in depreciation expense increased from the prior year period because of a million charge resulting from the impairment of marine assets in the beaumont area see note property  plant and equipment 
in addition  we wrote off approximately million in assets taken out of service during the period to depreciation expense 
depreciation expense also increased approximately million as a result of assets placed in service during and  partially offset by an increase in the estimated remaining life of a section of our pipeline system in the northeast  resulting from pipeline capital improvements made as part of our integrity management program 
operating fuel and power expense increased primarily as a result of higher power rates during the period 
in addition  we recognized net gains of million during from the sales of various assets in the downstream segment 
net losses from equity investments decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   as shown below in thousands years ended december  increase decrease centennial mb storage other total equity losses equity losses in centennial for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   decreased million  primarily due to increased transportation revenues and volumes and lower operating expenses 
during  we acquired an additional interest in centennial on february   bringing te products ownership interest to 
included in the equity loss for the year ended december   is million of equity income relating to the settlement of certain transmix matters recognized in previous periods 
equity earnings from our ownership interest in mb storage increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  in april  mb storage acquired storage and pipeline assets and contracts for approximately million  of which te products contributed million 
the increase in equity earnings is due to increased storage revenue  shuttle revenue and rental revenue primarily from the acquired contracts and lower pipeline rehabilitation expenses on the mb storage system  partially offset by increased amortization and depreciation expense on storage assets and contracts acquired 
other income net increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to higher interest income earned on cash investments and higher interest income earned on a capital lease 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues from refined products transportation increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   due to an overall increase of in the refined products volumes delivered 
this increase in volumes delivered was primarily due to deliveries of products received into our pipeline from centennial at creal springs  illinois 
centennial  which began operations in april  has provided our system with additional pipeline capacity for products originating in the us gulf coast area 
in february  we entered into a lease agreement with centennial that increased our capacity to deliver refined products to our market areas 
prior to the lease agreement with centennial  deliveries on our pipeline system were based upon a proration policy  which limited customer transportation 
during  with the expanded capacity through our lease agreement with centennial  our pipeline system was not prorated during portions of and was better able to serve markets which increased transportation on our system 
in addition  in december  we raised the operating pressure of our chicago lateral pipeline  which resulted in an increase in capacity for deliveries into the indianapolis and chicago markets 
with this incremental pipeline capacity  our previously constrained system has expanded deliveries in markets both south and north of creal springs 
volume increases were due to increased demand and market share for products supplied from the us gulf coast into midwest markets 
the refined products average rate per barrel increased from the prior year period primarily due to higher market based tariff rates which went into effect in july  partially offset by the impact of the midwest origin point for barrels received from centennial  which resulted in an increase in short haul barrels transported on our system 
revenues from lpgs transportation increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to increased deliveries of propane in the upper midwest and northeast market areas attributable to colder than normal weather during the first quarter of and due to low inventories at competing supply locations during the second and third quarters of the us gulf coast had higher propane inventory during as compared to the previous year because of higher than normal foreign propane imports at mont belvieu  which resulted in a lower propane price in this market area 
this lower price contributed to increased transportation deliveries to the mid continent market areas 
additional pipeline capacity for expanded propane movements was available due to a shift of refined product volumes to centennial 
butane deliveries also increased due to the increased demand by refineries for normal butane for use in gasoline blending and increased isobutane deliveries to chicago area refineries 
the lpgs average rate per barrel increased from the prior year period as a result of an increased percentage of long haul deliveries during the year ended december   and an increase in lpg tariff rates  which went into effect in july effective january   te products ownership interest in mb storage is accounted for as an equity investment as a result of the formation of mb storage 
revenues and expenses related to mont belvieu operations are now recorded within equity earnings 
see discussion regarding changes in equity earnings losses below 
other operating revenues increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to the addition of the northern portion of the dean pipeline to the downstream segment in january  which increased other operating revenues by million as the pipeline began transporting rgp in january the increase was also due to higher propane deliveries at our providence  rhode island import facility and higher refined product loading fees 
these increases were partially offset by lower revenues from product location exchanges which are used to position product in the midwest market area and lower volume of product inventory sales 
costs and expenses increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   due to increased operating  general and administrative expenses and increased depreciation and amortization expense  partially offset by decreased taxes other than income taxes and decreased operating fuel and power 
operating  general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher pipeline maintenance expenses  due in part to pipeline rehabilitation expenses associated with our integrity management program  increased consulting and contract services  increased labor costs primarily due to an increase in the number of employees between years  increased insurance expense  expense from the centennial pipeline capacity lease agreement that we entered into in and the write off of receivables of million related to customer bankruptcies or other customer non payments 
the addition of the northern portion of the dean pipeline to the downstream segment increased operating  general and administrative expense by million 
depreciation expense increased from the prior year period because of assets placed in service during the year 
in addition  we wrote off assets taken out of service during the period to depreciation expense  which also increased depreciation expense 
these increases in depreciation expense were partially offset by lower depreciation expense from assets retired during the year  which reduced the asset base  and due to the transfer of assets to mb storage 
taxes other than income taxes decreased as a result of actual property taxes being lower than previously estimated and due to the transfer of assets to mb storage 
operating fuel and power expense decreased as a result of lower power costs due to a slight decrease in the price of natural gas  partially offset by increased mainline throughput 
net losses from equity investments decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   as shown below in thousands years ended december  increase decrease centennial mb storage other total equity losses equity losses in centennial for the year ended december   increased million compared with the year ended december   due to higher operating expenses primarily as a result of a full year of operating costs in  partially offset by higher transportation volumes and revenues

equity earnings from our ownership interest in mb storage was million for the year ended december  amounts in the prior year period related to mont belvieu operations  which were recorded to revenues and costs and expenses are now being recorded within equity earnings based upon our ownership interest in mb storage  effective with its formation on january  if the revenues and costs and expenses from the mont belvieu operations had been accounted for under the same method as in  equity earnings from mb storage would have increased million in  compared with the prior year  due to increased shuttle deliveries and increased storage revenue  partially offset by increases in depreciation expense and rehabilitation expenses on mb storage assets 
other income net decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to lower interest income earned on cash investments 
upstream segment the following table provides financial information for the upstream segment for the years ended december   and in thousands years ended december  increase decrease sales of petroleum products transportation crude oil other total operating revenues purchases of petroleum products operating  general and administrative operating fuel and power depreciation and amortization taxes other than income taxes gains on sales of assets total costs and expenses operating income equity earnings other income net earnings before interest information presented in the following table includes the margin of the upstream segment  which may be viewed as a non gaap generally accepted accounting principles financial measure under the rules of the sec 
we calculate the margin of the upstream segment as revenues generated from the sale of crude oil and lubrication oil  and transportation of crude oil  less the costs of purchases of crude oil and lubrication oil 
we believe that margin is a more meaningful measure of financial performance than sales and purchases of crude oil and lubrication oil due to the significant fluctuations in sales and purchases caused by variations in the level of volumes marketed and prices for products marketed 
additionally  we use margin internally to evaluate the financial performance of the upstream segment as we believe margin is a better indicator of performance than operating income as operating  general and administrative expenses  operating fuel and power and depreciation expense are not directly related to the margin activities

our basin system also had increased transportation volumes and revenues primarily due to the expansion of the system between midland  texas  and wichita falls  texas  resulting in an additional capacity of ten thousand barrels per day on the system  and movements of barrels on higher tariff segments 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed the purchase of crude supply and transportation assets genesis  which have been integrated into our south texas system see note acquisitions and dispositions 
lubrication oil sales margin increased million due to increased sales of chemical volumes and increased volumes related to the acquisitions of lubrication oil distributors in abilene  texas  in december and in casper  wyoming  in august crude oil marketing margin increased million as a result of increased volumes marketed  partially offset by an unfavorable invoicing settlement on a marketing contract in the first quarter of  which reduced the marketing margin in  and increased transportation costs 
crude oil terminaling margin remained unchanged as a result of higher pumpover volumes at cushing  oklahoma  offset by lower pumpover volumes at midland  texas 
other operating revenues of the upstream segment increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to a million favorable settlement of inventory imbalances  and higher revenues from documentation and other services to support customers trading activity at midland and cushing 
costs and expenses  excluding expenses associated with purchases of crude oil and lubrication oil  increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   due to increased operating fuel and power  increased depreciation and amortization expense  increased operating  general and administrative expenses and increased taxes other than income taxes 
operating fuel and power increased million primarily as a result of the acquisition of the genesis assets and higher volumes in depreciation and amortization expense increased million primarily due to the assets acquired from genesis 
operating  general and administrative expenses increased million from the prior year primarily due to a million increase in pipeline inspection and repair costs associated with our integrity management program  a million increase in expenses related to the genesis acquisition  a million increase in labor and benefits expense related to incentive compensation plans and an increase in the number of employees between periods  a million increase in consulting and contract services related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and a million increase in rental expense due to our pipeline lease at freeport  texas  with seaway 
these increases were partially offset by million of higher environmental assessment and remediation costs in  million of expense in from the net settlement of crude oil imbalances with customers  million of higher legal costs in related to the litigation and settlement with drd environmental services  inc drd and million of lower expenses in from the sale of the rancho assets in taxes other than income taxes increased million due to increases in property tax accruals 
in june  we recorded a net gain of million  included in the gain on sale of assets in our consolidated statements of income  on the sale of certain of the assets of the rancho pipeline 
during the year ended december   we recorded net gains of million  included in the gains on sales of assets in our consolidated statements of income  primarily related to the sale of our remaining interest in the original rancho pipeline system see note acquisitions and dispositions 
equity earnings from our investment in seaway increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   due to higher transportation volumes  gains on crude oil inventory sales  a settlement with a former owner of seaway s crude oil assets regarding inventory imbalances that were not acquired by us and lower operating  general and administrative expenses 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  our margin increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  crude oil transportation margin increased million primarily due to increased revenues on our red river  basin  south texas and west texas systems resulting from a increase in transportation volumes on these systems partially due to the acquisition of the genesis assets 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed the purchase of crude supply and transportation assets genesis  which was integrated into our south texas system 
the acquisition of the genesis assets increased our transportation and marketing margins by approximately million and the barrels transported and marketed by approximately million barrels during lubrication oil sales margin increased million due to increased sales of chemical volumes  higher margins on lubrication sales and increased volumes related to the acquisition of a lubrication oil distributor in abilene  texas  in december crude oil marketing margin decreased million primarily due to an invoicing settlement on a marketing contract in the first quarter of  partially offset by increased volumes marketed  renegotiated supply contracts  lower trucking expenses and more favorable crude oil price differentials 
crude oil terminaling margin decreased million as a result of a decrease in volumes at midland  texas  and cushing  oklahoma 
costs and expenses  excluding expenses associated with purchases of crude oil and lubrication oil  increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  operating  general and administrative expenses increased million from the prior year period 
the increase includes a million increase in environmental assessment and remediation costs in  higher legal costs related to the litigation and settlement with drd and other legal costs see note commitments and contingencies  million of expense from the net settlement of crude oil imbalances with customers  higher pipeline rehabilitation expenses associated with our integrity management program and increased labor costs due to an increase in the number of employees between periods  partially offset by lower general and administrative supplies expenses during the period 
in addition  the acquisition of the genesis assets and integration into our south texas system during the fourth quarter increased operating  general and administrative expenses by approximately million 
operating fuel and power increased million due to higher power costs and higher volumes in depreciation and amortization expense increased million due to assets placed in service in and and due to asset retirements 
taxes other than income taxes increased million due to slight increases in property tax accruals 
equity earnings from our investment in seaway increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   due to a favorable crude oil imbalance settlement  a gain on the sale of inventory  lower general and administrative expenses and higher long haul transportation volumes  partially offset by our portion of equity earnings which decreased from to on a pro rated basis in averaging approximately for the year ended december   to in in june  we recorded a net gain of million  included in the gain on sale of assets in our consolidated statements of income  on the sale of certain of the assets of the rancho pipeline 
in connection with our acquisition of crude oil assets in  we acquired an approximate undivided joint interest in the rancho pipeline  which was a crude oil pipeline system from west texas to houston 
in march  the rancho pipeline ceased operations  and segments of the pipeline were sold to certain of the current owners that previously held undivided interests in the pipeline 
we acquired miles of the pipeline in exchange for cash of million and our interests in other portions of the rancho pipeline 
we sold miles of the segment we acquired to other entities for cash and assets valued at approximately million 
other income net decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to lower interest income received on intercompany borrowings 
midstream segment the following table provides financial information for the midstream segment for the years ended december   and in thousands years ended december  increase decrease sales of petroleum products gathering natural gas transportation ngls other total operating revenues purchases of petroleum products operating  general and administrative operating fuel and power depreciation and amortization taxes other than income taxes total costs and expenses operating income other income net earnings before interest the following table presents volume and average rate information for the years ended december   and in thousands  except average fee and average rate amounts years ended december  percentage increase decrease gathering natural gas jonah million cubic feet million british thermal units mmbtu average fee per mmbtu gathering natural gas val verde million cubic feet mmbtu average fee per mmbtu transportation ngls thousand barrels average rate per barrel fractionation ngls thousand barrels average rate per barrel sales condensate thousand barrels average rate per barrel year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues from the gathering of natural gas increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  natural gas gathering revenues from the jonah system increased million and volumes gathered increased bcf for the year ended december   due to the expansion of the jonah system during the phase iii expansion was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of and increased system capacity from mmcf day to  mmcf day 
the increase in jonah s revenues was also partially due to higher gathering rates realized due to lower system pressures resulting from the increased capacity provided by the phase iii expansion 
natural gas gathering revenues from the val verde system decreased million and volumes gathered decreased bcf for the year ended december   primarily due to the natural decline of cbm production and slower than anticipated completion and connection of infill wells  partially offset by increased volumes from two new connections made to the val verde system in may and december val verde s average natural gas gathering rate per mmcf decreased due to contracts entered into relating to the new connections  which have lower rates than the existing val verde system s average rates 
jonah s pioneer gas processing plant was completed during the first quarter of  as a part of the phase iii expansion to increase the processing capacity in southwestern wyoming 
pioneer s processing agreements allow the producers to elect annually whether to be charged under a fee based arrangement or a fee plus keep whole arrangement 
under the fee based election  jonah receives a fee for its processing services 
under the fee plus keep whole election  jonah receives a lower fee for its processing services  retains and sells the ngls extracted during the process and delivers to the producers residue gas equivalent in energy to the natural gas received from the producers 
jonah purchases gas from an affiliate of defs to replace the equivalent energy removed in the liquids 
jonah sells the ngls it retains to an affiliate of defs 
for the year ended december   the sales and purchases under the fee arrangements at the pioneer plant resulted in a margin sales of petroleum products less purchases of petroleum products of million 
revenues from the transportation of ngls increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to increases in volumes transported on the chaparral and panola pipelines  partially offset by decreased volumes on the dean and wilcox pipelines 
higher average rates per barrel on volumes transported on the panola and wilcox pipelines were offset by lower average rates per barrel on volumes transported on the chaparral and dean pipelines 
other operating revenues increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  processing fee revenues increased million as a result of jonah s pioneer processing plant  which was constructed as part of the phase iii expansion and placed in service in january jonah s other operating revenues also increased million primarily due to higher condensate sales 
other operating revenues on chaparral increased million due to the recognition of deferred revenue related to an inventory settlement 
val verde s operating revenues increased million due to revenues generated as a result of contractual producer minimum fuel levels exceeding actual operating fuel usage during the year ended december  val verde retains a portion of its producers gas to compensate for fuel used in operations 
the actual usage of gas can differ from the amount contractually retained from producers 
value retained from producers or sales generated as a result of efficient fuel usage is recognized as other operating revenues 
costs and expenses excluding purchases of petroleum products increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   due to increases in operating  general and administrative expense  operating fuel and power and taxes other than income taxes  partially offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense 
operating  general and administrative expense increased due to a million increase in gas settlement expenses  a million increase in general and administrative labor expense  a million increase in consulting and contract services related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  a million increase related to our integrity management program and a million increase related to jonah s processing plant which began operations in these increases are partially offset by a million decrease in expense related to the sale of our enron corp 
receivable  which had been fully reserved in  and a million decrease in maintenance expenditures at val verde 
operating fuel and power increased million  primarily due to higher variable power rates and increased ngl volumes transported during times of peak variable power rates 
depreciation expense increased million  primarily as a result of assets placed in service in related to the expansion of the jonah system and additional well connections on the val verde system in taxes other than income taxes increased million as a result of higher property balances 
amortization expense decreased million primarily due to revisions to the estimated life of jonah s intangible assets under the units of production method  partially offset by a million increase as a result of higher volumes in the period 
in second quarter  jonah s estimated total throughput of the system was adjusted  which resulted in an extension of the expected amortization period from years to years 
during the fourth quarter of  additional limited production forecasts were obtained from some of the producers on the jonah system related to future expansions of the system  and as a result  we again increased our best estimate of future throughput on the jonah system 
this increase in the estimate of future throughput extended the amortization period of jonah s natural gas gathering contracts by an estimated years  increasing from approximately years to approximately years see note goodwill and other intangible assets 
amortization expense on the val verde system decreased million primarily due to lower volumes in the period  resulting from the natural decline in cbm production 
other income net decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   due to lower interest income earned on cash investments 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues from the gathering of natural gas increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  natural gas gathering revenues from the jonah system increased million and volumes gathered increased bcf for the year ended december   due to the expansions of the jonah system during the first expansion  which was completed in may  increased the capacity of the jonah system by  from approximately mmcf day to approximately mmcf day 
in october  additional expansion projects were completed  which increased the capacity of the jonah system from mmcf day to approximately mmcf day 
a phase iii expansion was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of and increased system capacity to  mmcf day 
the increase in jonah s revenues was also partially due to an increase in the average natural gas gathering rate due to certain volume thresholds being exceeded 
natural gas gathering revenues from the val verde system increased million and volumes gathered increased bcf for the year ended december   primarily due to the acquisition of the val verde system on june  volumes delivered for the first half of were approximately bcf 
as val verde was acquired on june   there were no comparable volumes for the first half of volumes delivered during the second half of as compared to the second half of declined approximately bcf 
this decrease in volumes during the second half of was due to the natural decline of cbm production  which resulted in decreased revenues  partially offset by an increase in the average natural gas gathering rate due to annual fee escalations in gathering agreements and higher carbon dioxide treating fees as a result of increasing carbon dioxide content in the natural gas 
revenues from the transportation of ngls increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to an increase of million related to the acquisition of chaparral on march   million due to an increase in volumes transported on chaparral and million due to an increase in volumes transported on the wilcox pipeline 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease of million due to lower transportation volumes on panola as a result of lower ngl volumes available from the connected ngl plants and a decrease of million on the southern portion of the dean pipeline due to decreased transportation volumes 
lower transportation volumes on the southern portion of the dean pipeline resulted from the conversion of the northern portion of the pipeline to transport rgp and subsequent classification as a part of the downstream segment  effective january  the decrease in the ngl transportation average rate per barrel resulted from a lower average rate per barrel on volumes transported on chaparral 
costs and expenses increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   due to increased depreciation and amortization expense  increased operating  general and administrative expense and increased operating fuel and power  partially offset by decreased taxes other than income taxes 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million due to the chaparral and val verde assets acquired on march   and june   respectively  million due to assets placed in service in related primarily to the expansions of the jonah system and million in amortization expense on jonah s intangible assets under the units of production method  as volumes gathered increased between periods 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in amortization expense on val verde s intangible assets under the units of production method as volumes gathered decreased between periods 
in addition  amortization expense on jonah decreased million related to its intangible assets 
in second quarter  jonah s estimated total throughput of the system was adjusted  which resulted in an extension of the expected amortization period from years to years see note goodwill and other intangible assets 
operating  general and administrative expense increased million from the assets acquired  and million primarily due to higher general and administrative labor and supplies expense and increased consulting and contracting services 
operating fuel and power costs increased million due to the assets acquired and million due to increased volumes transported on chaparral 
taxes other than income taxes decreased million due to actual property taxes being lower than previously estimated on val verde  panola and the southern portion of the dean pipeline 
interest expense and capitalized interest year ended december  compared with year ended december  interest expense decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   due to a higher percentage of variable interest rate debt during the year ended december   that carried a lower rate of interest as compared to fixed interest rate debt 
the higher percentage of variable interest rate debt resulted from the expiration of an interest rate swap in april see note interest rate swaps 
the decrease was partially offset by higher balances outstanding on our revolving credit facility in capitalized interest decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   due to interest capitalized on lower construction work in progress balances in year ended december  compared with year ended december  interest expense increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to million of additional expense related to changes in our fair value and cash flow hedging activities  million of additional expense related to the issuance of our senior notes in january and our senior notes in february and million of debt issuance costs written off in june related to the refinancing of our revolving credit facility 
these increases were partially offset by a million reduction in interest expense related to decreased borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
capitalized interest increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   due to increased construction work in progress balances during  partially offset by interest capitalized on our investment in centennial during the first quarter of financial condition and liquidity cash generated from operations  credit facilities and debt and equity offerings are our primary sources of liquidity 
at december   and  we had working capital deficits of million and million  respectively 
at december   we had approximately million in available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility to cover any working capital needs

cash provided by operating activities increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to an increase of million in distributions received from our equity investments in seaway and mb storage during the year ended december   and higher net income and depreciation and amortization expense in the period  partially offset by the timing of cash disbursements and cash receipts for working capital components 
cash provided by operating activities increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to higher net income and depreciation and amortization expense resulting from our acquisition of val verde  partially offset by the million non cash gain on the sale of assets in distributions from equity method investments decreased from to  primarily due to our sharing ratio in seaway decreasing from to between years  partially offset by a distribution from mb storage in of million 
we believe that we will continue to have adequate liquidity to fund future recurring operating and investing activities 
our primary cash requirements consist of normal operating expenses  capital expenditures to sustain existing operations and revenue generating expenditures  interest payments on our senior notes and revolving credit facility  distributions to our general partner and unitholders and acquisitions of new assets or businesses 
short term cash requirements  such as operating expenses  capital expenditures to sustain existing operations and quarterly distributions to our general partner and unitholders  are expected to be funded through operating cash flows 
long term cash requirements for expansion projects and acquisitions are expected to be funded by several sources  including cash flows from operating activities  borrowings under credit facilities  and the issuance of additional equity and debt securities 
our ability to complete future debt and equity offerings and the timing of any such offerings will depend on various factors  including prevailing market conditions  interest rates and our financial condition and our credit rating at the time

the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants  including  but not limited to  covenants limiting the creation of liens securing indebtedness and sale and leaseback transactions 
however  the indenture does not limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness

distributions and issuance of additional limited partner units we paid cash distributions to our limited partners and general partner  including general partner incentive distributions  of million per unit  million per unit and million per unit during each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
additionally  on january   we declared a cash distribution of per unit for the quarter ended december  the distribution of million was paid on february   to unitholders of record on january  see note partners capital and distributions 
on april   we sold in an underwritten public offering million units at per unit 
the proceeds from the offering  net of underwriting discount  totaled approximately million  of which approximately million was used to repurchase and retire all of the million previously outstanding class b units held by dettco 
we received approximately million in proceeds from the offering in excess of the amount needed to repurchase and retire the class b units 
on august   we sold in an underwritten public offering million units at per unit 
the proceeds from the offering  net of underwriting discount  totaled approximately million 
on august    units were sold upon exercise of the underwriters over allotment option granted in connection with the offering on august  proceeds from the over allotment sale  net of underwriting discount  totaled million 
approximately million of the proceeds were used to repay indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and million was used to fund the acquisition of the genesis assets see note acquisitions and dispositions 
the remaining amount was used primarily to fund revenue generating and system upgrade capital expenditures and for general partnership purposes 
general partner interest as of december  and  we had deficit balances of million and million  respectively  in our general partner s equity account 
this negative balance does not represent an asset to us and does not represent an obligation of the general partner to contribute cash or other property to us 
the general partner s equity account generally consists of its cumulative share of our net income less cash distributions made to it plus capital contributions that it has made to us see our consolidated statements of partners capital for a detail of the general partner s equity account 
for the years ended december  and  the general partner was allocated million representing and million representing  respectively  of our net income and received million and million  respectively  in cash distributions 
capital accounts  as defined under our partnership agreement  are maintained for our general partner and our limited partners 
the capital account provisions of our partnership agreement incorporate principles established for us federal income tax purposes and are not comparable to the equity accounts reflected under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in our financial statements 
under our partnership agreement  the general partner is required to make additional capital contributions to us upon the issuance of any additional units if necessary to maintain a capital account balance equal to of the total capital accounts of all partners 
at december  and  the general partner s capital account balance substantially exceeded this requirement 
net income is allocated between the general partner and the limited partners in the same proportion as aggregate cash distributions made to the general partner and the limited partners during the period 
this is generally consistent with the manner of allocating net income under our partnership agreement 
net income determined under our partnership agreement  however  incorporates principles established for us federal income tax purposes and is not comparable to net income reflected under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in our financial statements 
cash distributions that we make during a period may exceed our net income for the period 
we make quarterly cash distributions of all of our available cash  generally defined as consolidated cash receipts less consolidated cash disbursements and cash reserves established by the general partner in its sole discretion see note partners capital and distributions 
cash distributions in excess of net income allocations and capital contributions during the years ended december  and  resulted in a deficit in the general partner s equity account at december  and future cash distributions that exceed net income will result in an increase in the deficit balance in the general partner s equity account 
according to the partnership agreement  in the event of our dissolution  after satisfying our liabilities  our remaining assets would be divided among our limited partners and the general partner generally in the same proportion as available cash but calculated on a cumulative basis over the life of the partnership 
if a deficit balance still remains in the general partner s equity account after all allocations are made between the partners  the general partner would not be required to make whole any such deficit 
future capital needs and commitments we estimate that capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  for will be approximately million which includes million of capitalized interest 
we expect to spend approximately million for revenue generating projects and facility improvements 
capital spending on revenue generating projects and facility improvements will include approximately million for the expansion of our downstream segment facilities 
we expect to spend million to expand our upstream segment pipelines and facilities in west texas and oklahoma and approximately million to expand our midstream segment assets  with further expansions on our jonah system 
we expect to spend approximately million to sustain existing operations  including life cycle replacements for equipment at various facilities and pipeline and tank replacements among all of our business segments 
we expect to spend approximately million to improve operational efficiencies and reduce costs among all of our business segments 
we continually review and evaluate potential capital improvements and expansions that would be complementary to our present business operations 
these expenditures can vary greatly depending on the magnitude of our transactions 
we may finance capital expenditures through internally generated funds  debt or the issuance of additional equity 
our debt repayment obligations consist of payments for principal and interest on i the te products million senior notes due january   ii outstanding principal amounts under the revolving credit facility due in october million outstanding at december   iii our million senior notes due february   iv our million senior notes due february   and v the te products million senior notes due january  te products is contingently liable as guarantor for the lesser of one half or million principal amount plus interest of the borrowings of centennial

during the years ended december  and  te products contributed million to mb storage  of which million was used for its acquisition of storage and pipeline assets in april  and million  respectively  for capital expenditures 
during  te products may be required to contribute cash to centennial to cover capital expenditures  acquisitions or other operating needs and to mb storage to cover significant capital expenditures or additional acquisitions 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not rely on off balance sheet borrowings to fund our acquisitions 
we have no off balance sheet commitments for indebtedness other than the limited guaranty of centennial debt and leases covering assets utilized in several areas of our operations 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our debt repayment obligations and material contractual commitments as of december  in millions amount of commitment expiration per period total less than year years years more than years revolving credit facility senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due debt subtotal operating leases capital expenditure obligations other liabilities and deferred credits total obligations of te products 
our te products subsidiary entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge its exposure to changes in the fair value of its senior notes due at december   the senior notes include an adjustment to increase the fair value of the debt by million related to this interest rate swap agreement 
we also entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge our exposure to changes in the fair value of our senior notes due at december   the senior notes include a deferred gain  net of amortization  from previous interest rate swap terminations of million 
at december   our senior notes  our senior notes and our senior notes include million of unamortized debt discounts

includes accruals for costs incurred but not yet paid relating to capital projects 
excludes approximately million of long term deferred revenue payments  which are being transferred to income over the term of the respective revenue contracts 
the amount of commitment by year is our best estimate of projected payments of these long term liabilities 
we expect to repay the long term  senior unsecured obligations and bank debt through the issuance of additional long term senior unsecured debt at the time the   and debt matures  issuance of additional equity  with proceeds from dispositions of assets  cash flow from operations or any combination of the above items 
in addition to the items in the table above  we have entered into various operational commitments and agreements related to pipeline operations and to the marketing  transportation  terminaling and storage of crude oil 
the majority of contractual commitments for the purchase of crude oil that are made range in term from a thirty day evergreen to three years 
a substantial portion of the contracts for the purchase of crude oil that extend beyond thirty days include cancellation provisions that allow us to cancel the contract with thirty days written notice 
during the year ended december   crude oil purchases averaged approximately million per month 
sources of future capital historically  we have funded our capital commitments from operating cash flow and borrowings under bank credit facilities or bridge loans 
we repaid these loans in part by the issuance of long term debt in capital markets and the public offering of units 
we expect future capital needs would be similarly funded to the extent not otherwise available from cash flow from operations 
as of december   we had million in available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility  subject to compliance with prescribed financial covenants 
we expect that cash flows from operating activities will be adequate to fund cash distributions and capital additions necessary to sustain existing operations 
however  future expansionary capital projects and acquisitions will require funding through borrowings under our revolving credit facility or proceeds from the sale of additional debt or equity offerings  or any combination thereof

other considerations credit risks risks of non payment and nonperformance by customers are a major consideration in our businesses

terrorist threats on september   the united states was the target of terrorist attacks of unprecedented scale 
since the september attacks  the united states government has issued warnings that energy assets  specifically the nation s pipeline infrastructure  could be a future target of terrorist organizations 
these developments have subjected our operations to increased risks 
any terrorist attack on our facilities  customers facilities and  in some cases  those of other pipelines  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have increased security initiatives and are working with various governmental agencies to minimize risks associated with additional terrorist attacks 
environmental our operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  imposition of injunctions delaying or prohibiting certain activities and the need to perform investigatory and remedial activities 
although we believe our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations  risks of significant costs and liabilities are inherent in pipeline operations  and we cannot assure you that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred 
moreover  it is possible that other developments  such as increasingly strict environmental laws and regulations and enforcement policies thereunder  and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from our operations  could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us 
we believe that changes in environmental laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows in the near term

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we may be exposed to market risk through changes in crude oil commodity prices and interest rates 
we do not have foreign exchange risks 
our risk management committee has established policies to monitor and control these market risks 
the risk management committee is comprised  in part  of senior executives of the company 
we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced between crude oil purchases and sales and future delivery obligations 
on the majority of our crude oil derivative contracts  we take the normal purchase and normal sale exclusion in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
occasionally  customers require pricing terms which do not allow us to balance our position 
additionally  certain pricing terms may expose us to movements in margin 
on a small portion of our crude oil marketing business  we enter into derivative contracts such as physical swaps and other business hedging devices for which we cannot take the normal purchase and normal sale exclusion and for which we do not elect hedge accounting 
the terms of these contracts are less than one year 
the purpose is to balance our position or lock in a margin and  as such  do not expose us to any additional significant market risk 
we mark these transactions to market and the changes in the fair value are recognized in current earnings 
this could potentially result in some financial statement variability during quarterly periods  however  any unrealized gains and losses reflected in the financial statements related to marking these transactions to market will be offset by realized gains and losses in different quarterly periods when the related physical transactions are settled 
at december   we had million outstanding under our variable interest rate revolving credit facility 
the interest rate is based  at our option  on either the lender s base rate plus a spread or libor plus a spread in effect at the time of the borrowings and is adjusted monthly  bimonthly  quarterly or semiannually

we have utilized and expect to continue to utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our cash flow and fair value risks 
interest rate swap agreements are used to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and overall cost of borrowing 
interest rate swaps that manage our cash flow risk reduce our exposure to increases in the benchmark interest rates underlying variable rate debt 
interest rate swaps that manage our fair value risks are intended to reduce our exposure to changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt 
interest rate swap agreements involve the periodic exchange of payments without the exchange of the notional amount upon which the payments are based 
the related amount payable to or receivable from counterparties is included as an adjustment to accrued interest 
in october  te products entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge its exposure to changes in the fair value of its fixed rate senior notes due we designated this swap agreement as a fair value hedge 
the swap agreement has a notional amount of million and matures in january to match the principal and maturity of the te products senior notes

the fair value of this interest rate swap was a gain of approximately million at december   and a gain of approximately million at december  utilizing the balance of the te products senior notes outstanding at december   and including the effects of hedging activities  assuming market interest rates increase basis points  the potential annual increase in interest expense is million 
in july  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge our exposure to increases in the benchmark interest rate underlying our variable rate revolving credit facility 
this interest rate swap matured in april we designated this swap agreement  which hedged exposure to variability in expected future cash flows attributed to changes in interest rates  as a cash flow hedge 
the swap agreement was based on a notional amount of million 
under the swap agreement  we paid a fixed rate of interest of and received a floating rate based on a three month us dollar libor rate 
because this swap was designated as a cash flow hedge  the changes in fair value  to the extent the swap was effective  were recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged interest costs were recognized in earnings 
in june  we repaid the amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility with borrowings under a new three year revolving credit facility and canceled the old facility see note debt 
we redesignated this interest rate swap as a hedge of our exposure to increases in the benchmark interest rate underlying the new variable rate revolving credit facility 
during the years ended december   and  we recognized increases in interest expense of million  million and million  respectively  related to the difference between the fixed rate and the floating rate of interest on the interest rate swap 
during  we determined that we would repay a portion of the amount outstanding under the revolving credit facility with proceeds from our unit offering in august see note partners capital and distributions resulting in a reduction of probable future interest payments under the credit facility 
we reduced the outstanding balance of the revolving credit facility at december   to million 
during the year ended december   we recognized a loss of million for the portion of the discontinued hedge 
the total fair value of the interest rate swap was a loss of approximately million at december  the remaining million of other comprehensive income was transferred to earnings during the period from january   through the maturity of the interest rate swap in april in february  we entered into interest rate swap agreements  designated as fair value hedges  to hedge our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate senior notes due the swap agreements had a combined notional amount of million and matured in to match the principal and maturity of the senior notes 
under the swap agreements  we paid a floating rate of interest based on a us dollar libor rate  plus a spread  and received a fixed rate of interest of 
in july  the swap agreements were terminated resulting in a gain of approximately million 
concurrent with the swap terminations  we entered into new interest rate swap agreements  with identical terms as the previous swap agreements  however  the floating rate of interest was based upon a spread of an additional basis points 
in december  the swap agreements entered into in july were terminated  resulting in a gain of approximately million 
the gains realized from the july and december swap terminations have been deferred as adjustments to the carrying value of the senior notes and are being amortized using the effective interest method as reductions to future interest expense over the remaining term of the senior notes 
at december   the unamortized balance of the deferred gains was million 
in the event of early extinguishment of the senior notes  any remaining unamortized gains would be recognized in the consolidated statement of income at the time of extinguishment
