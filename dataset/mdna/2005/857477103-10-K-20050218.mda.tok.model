notes to the consolidated financial statements note summary of significant accounting policies organization and nature of operations state street corporation state street or the corporation is a financial holding company and reports two lines of business

the accounting and reporting policies of state street and its subsidiaries conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
significant policies are summarized below 
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of state street and its subsidiaries  including its principal subsidiary  state street bank and trust company state street bank 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
the assets and liabilities of non us operations are translated at month end exchange rates  and revenue and expenses are translated at rates that approximate average monthly exchange rates 
gains or losses from the translation of the net assets of non us subsidiaries  net of related taxes  are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
cash and cash equivalents for the consolidated statement of cash flows  state street has defined cash equivalents as those amounts included in the consolidated statement of condition caption  cash and due from banks 
resale and repurchase agreements state street purchases us treasury and federal agency securities us government securities under agreements to resell the securities 
these purchases are recorded as securities purchased under resale agreements  an asset in the consolidated statement of condition 
these purchases have been reduced by offsetting balances with the same counterparty where a master netting agreement exists 
state street can use these securities as collateral for repurchase agreements 
state street s policy is to take possession or control of the security underlying the resale agreement  allowing borrowers the right of collateral substitution and or short notice termination 
the securities are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary from the borrower 
state street enters into sales of us government securities under repurchase agreements  which are treated as financings  and the obligations to repurchase such securities sold are reflected as a liability in the consolidated statement of condition 
the dollar amount of us government securities underlying the repurchase agreements remains in investment securities 
securities debt securities are held in both the investment and trading account portfolios 
debt and marketable equity securities that are classified as available for sale are reported at fair value  and the after tax net unrealized gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity 
securities classified as held to maturity are stated at cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts 
gains or losses on sales of available for sale securities are computed based on the specific identification method 
trading account assets are held in anticipation of short term market movements and for resale to clients 
trading account assets are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in processing fees and other revenue 
when the fair value of an investment security declines below its amortized cost  state street considers available evidence  including the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  to evaluate if the decline is other than temporary 
if the decline is considered other than temporary  the amortized cost basis of the investment security is written down to its current fair value  which becomes the new cost basis  and a charge to income is recorded and included in processing fees and other revenue 
loans and lease financing loans are generally reported at the principal amount outstanding  net of the allowance for loan losses  unearned income  and any net deferred loan fees 
interest income is recognized using the interest method or on a basis approximating a level rate of return over the term of the loan 
fees received for providing loan commitments and letters of credit that state street anticipates will result in loans are typically deferred and amortized to interest income over the life of the related loan  beginning with the initial borrowing 
fees on commitments and letters of credit are amortized to processing fees and other revenue over the commitment period when funding is not known or expected 
it is state street s policy to place loans on a non accrual basis when they become days past due as to either principal or interest  or when  in the opinion of management  full collection of principal or interest is unlikely 
loans days past due  but considered both well secured and in the process of collection  are treated as exceptions and may be exempted from non accrual status 
when the loan is placed on non accrual status  the accrual of interest is discontinued and previously recorded but unpaid interest is reversed and charged against net interest revenue 
for loans categorized as non accrual  revenue is recognized on a cash basis  if and when interest payments are received 
leveraged leases are carried net of non recourse debt 
revenue on leveraged leases is recognized on a basis calculated to achieve a constant rate of return on the outstanding investment in the leases  net of related deferred tax liabilities  in the years in which the net investment is positive 
gains and losses on residual values of leased equipment sold are included in processing fees and other revenue 
allowance for credit losses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management 
factors considered in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance include previous loss experience  current economic conditions and adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay  timing of future payments  estimated value of the underlying collateral and the performance of individual credits in relation to contract terms  and other relevant factors 
the provision for loan losses charged to earnings is based upon management s judgment of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level adequate to absorb probable losses 
loans are charged off to the allowance for loan losses in the reporting period in which either an event occurs that confirms the existence of a loss or it is determined that a loan or a portion of a loan is not collectible 
recoveries are recorded on a cash basis 
in addition  the corporation maintains a reserve for off balance sheet credit exposures that is included in other liabilities in the consolidated statement of condition 
the adequacy of the reserve is subject to the same considerations and review as the allowance for loan losses 
provisions to change the level of the reserve are included in other operating expenses 
premises and equipment buildings  leasehold improvements  computers  software and other equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization charged to operating expenses are computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the related asset or the remaining term of the lease 
for owned and capitalized assets  estimated useful lives range from to years 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred  while major leasehold improvements are capitalized and expensed over their useful lives 
for premises held under leases where state street has an obligation to restore the facilities to their original condition upon expiration of the lease  state street accrues the anticipated related costs over the life of the lease 
state street s policy is to capitalize costs relating to internal use software development projects that provide significant new functionality 
state street considers projects for capitalization that are expected to yield long term operational benefits  such as applications that result in operational efficiencies and or incremental revenue streams 
software customization costs relating to specific client enhancements are expensed as incurred 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired 
other intangible assets represent purchased assets that can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual rights or because the asset can be exchanged on its own or in combination with a related contract  asset or liability 
customer list intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over fifteen years 
goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to annual impairment tests whereby goodwill is allocated to the corporation s reporting units 
impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of a reporting unit  including its allocation of goodwill and intangibles  exceeds its estimated fair value 
if it is determined  based on these reviews  that goodwill is impaired  the value of goodwill is adjusted through a charge to earnings 
investments in affiliates investments in affiliates in which the corporation has the ability to exercise significant influence  but not control  are accounted for using the equity method  unless the affiliate is determined to be a variable interest entity vie for which state street is considered the primary beneficiary  in which case  state street consolidates the vie 
derivative financial instruments state street records derivative instruments at fair value in the consolidated statement of condition 
the change in fair value of the corporation s derivative instruments is recorded currently in earnings  except for certain interest rate swap agreements that are accounted for as cash flow or fair value hedges 
the corporation has determined that the interest rate swaps accounted for as cash flow hedges and hedges of net investments in foreign subsidiaries constitute fully effective hedges  and as such  all changes in fair value of these agreements  net of tax  are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income 
for interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges  the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument  as well as the hedged item  are both reported in earnings in the current period in processing fees and other revenue 
at both the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis  state street formally assesses and documents the effectiveness of a derivative instrument in offsetting changes in the fair value of hedged items and the likelihood that the derivative instrument will remain highly effective in future periods 
state street discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it determines that the derivative instrument is no longer effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of the underlying exposure being hedged  the derivative instrument expires  terminates or is sold  or management discontinues the derivative s hedge designation 
unrealized gains and losses on foreign exchange and interest rate contracts are reported at fair value in the consolidated statement of condition as a component of other assets and other liabilities  respectively  on a gross basis except where such gains and losses arise from contracts covered by qualifying master netting agreements 
revenue recognition revenue recorded as servicing fees  management fees  securities lending fees  foreign exchange trading  brokerage fees and certain types of revenue recorded in processing fees and other is recognized when earned based on contractual terms and is accrued based on estimates  or is recognized as transactions occur or services are provided and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue on interest earning assets is recognized based on the effective yield of the financial instrument 
pensions the corporation s qualified retirement plans cover substantially all full time employees and certain part time employees 
pension expense under these plans is calculated in accordance with the guidance contained in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
this expense is charged to current operations and consists of several components based on various actuarial assumptions regarding future experience under the plans 
income taxes the corporation uses an asset and liability approach to account for income taxes 
the objective is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year  and to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between the amounts reported in the financial statements and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the measurement of tax assets and liabilities is based on enacted tax laws and applicable tax rates 
earnings per share basic earnings per share excludes all dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
diluted earnings per share includes all dilution from stock options and awards  and other equity related financial instruments 
stock based compensation for  the corporation applied the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb no 
and related interpretations in accounting for its stock based compensation plans

on january   state street adopted sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 which provides for the expensing of stock options using the fair value method 
state street used the prospective transition method afforded under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment to sfas no 
under this method  compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the service period of the award 
a black scholes option pricing model was used for purposes of estimating the fair value of state street s employee stock options at the grant date under sfas no 
the weighted average assumptions for the years ended december were dividend yield expected volatility risk free interest rate expected option lives in years the weighted average fair value of stock options granted in  and was  and per share  respectively

r to have a significant impact on the financial position or results of operations of the corporation 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
as a result of this interpretation  state street applied an expected loss model to its special purpose entities spes  which issue asset backed commercial paper  to determine the primary beneficiary of these variable interest entities vies 
variable interests factored into the model included basis risk  credit risk  interest risk and fees paid to the administrator 
state street holds no equity ownership interest in these vies  which are structured as bankruptcy remote corporations 
as a result of the model  state street modified the vies by selling certain fixed rate assets and related interest rate swaps  and issuing subordinated notes to outside investors 
those changes clarify the fact that state street is not the primary beneficiary  as defined in fin  and as such does not consolidate the vies 
additionally  state street deconsolidated the trusts that issue trust preferred capital securities in the fourth quarter of the impact of deconsolidating the trusts was an increase to other assets and long term debt of million

the internal revenue service irs has completed its review of state street s federal income tax returns in the third quarter of for  and and has proposed to disallow tax deductions related to lease in lease out lilo transactions 
state street believes that it reported the tax effects of these transactions properly based on applicable statutes  regulations and case law in effect at the time they were entered into  a court or other judicial or administrative authority could disagree 
the irs has indicated that it will consider settling leasing disputes such as these with taxpayers 
state street is pursuing its administrative remedies with the irs 
while it is unclear whether state street will be able to reach an acceptable settlement  management believes the corporation is appropriately accrued for tax exposures  including exposures related to lilo transactions  and related interest expense

the fasb is reviewing the accounting for significant changes in tax related cash flows of lilo transactions 
it is possible that the fasb will issue guidance requiring the recalculation of the allocation of income over the lease term when an event triggers a significant change in the assumed tax related cash flows of a transaction 
if the fasb does issue new guidance and the corporation were to settle with the irs or receive an adverse decision in court  the assumptions used in accounting for the lilo transactions could change significantly  resulting in a cumulative change in the related income recorded on these transactions 
the fasb is reviewing the current gaap treatment of negotiated settlements of tax disputes involving leases accounted for under sfas no 
it is possible the fasb s review could result in a new financial accounting standard and could have an impact on the financial statements of state street 
the corporation will continue to monitor fasb proceedings 
if fasb issues new standards governing uncertain tax positions  or guidance that changes industry practice with respect to sfas no 
matters  the corporation will consider the effect to any potential settlement with the irs  and to the adequacy of the tax reserve 
it is not possible at this time to predict the changes that fasb might accept  or their financial statement impact to the corporation

a derivative instrument is a financial instrument or other contract which has one or more underlying and one or more notional amounts  no initial net investment  or a smaller initial net investment than would be expected for similar types of contracts  and which requires or permits net settlement 
derivative instruments include forwards  futures  swaps  options and other instruments with similar characteristics 
the use of these instruments impacts fee revenue or net interest revenue 
interest rate contracts involve an agreement with a counterparty to exchange cash flows based on the movement of an underlying interest rate index 
an interest rate swap agreement involves the exchange of a series of interest payments  either at a fixed or variable rate  based upon the notional amount without the exchange of the underlying principal amount 
an interest rate option contract provides the purchaser  for a premium  the right  but not the obligation  to buy or sell the underlying financial instrument at a set price at or during a specified period 
an interest rate futures contract is a commitment to buy or sell  at a future date  a financial instrument at a contracted price  it may be settled in cash or through the delivery of the contracted instrument 
foreign exchange contracts involve an agreement to exchange one currency for another currency at an agreed upon rate and settlement date 
foreign exchange contracts consist of swap agreements and forward and spot contracts 
the following table summarizes the contractual or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments held or issued for trading and balance sheet management as of december dollars in millions trading interest rate contracts swap agreements options and caps purchased options and caps written futures foreign exchange contracts forward  swap and spot options purchased options written balance sheet management interest rate contracts swap agreements foreign exchange contracts forward  swap and spot in connection with balance sheet management activities  state street has executed interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value and cash flow hedges to manage interest rate risk 
the notional values of these interest rate contracts and the related assets or liabilities being hedged at december  were as follows fair value hedges cash flow hedges total fair value hedges cash flow hedges total dollars in millions available for sale investment securities interest bearing time deposits long term debt total for the years ended december  and  the fair value hedges of long term debt increased the value of long term debt presented in the consolidated statement of condition by million and million  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  the corporation s overall weighted average interest rate for long term debt was and  respectively  on a contractual basis  and and  respectively  including the effects of hedges 
for the years ended december  and  the corporation s overall weighted average interest rate for interest bearing time deposits was and  respectively  on a contractual basis  and and  respectively  including the effects of hedges 
for the years ended december   and  state street recognized net pre tax losses of approximately million  million and million  respectively  which represented the ineffective portion of hedges  reported in processing fees and other revenue 
during  state street entered into foreign exchange forward contracts with a basis of million  or approximately million  to hedge a portion of the corporation s net foreign investment in non us subsidiaries 
as a result  approximately million of after tax translation losses on the hedge contracts were included within accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
fair value of derivative financial instruments state street s risk exposure from interest rate and foreign exchange contracts results from the possibility that one party may default on its contractual obligation or from movements in exchange or interest rates 
credit risk is limited to the positive market value of the derivative financial instrument  which is significantly less than the notional value 
the notional value provides the basis for determining the exchange of contractual cash flows 
the exposure to credit loss can be estimated by calculating the cost  on a present value basis  to replace at current market rates all profitable contracts at year end 
the estimated aggregate replacement cost of derivative financial instruments in a net positive position was billion at december   and billion at december  the foreign exchange contracts have been reduced by offsetting balances with the same counterparty where a master netting agreement exists 
the following table represents the fair value as of december  and average fair value for the years ended december  of financial derivative instruments held or issued for trading purposes fair value average fair value dollars in millions foreign exchange contracts contracts in a receivable position contracts in a payable position other financial instrument contracts contracts in a receivable position contracts in a payable position foreign exchange contracts contracts in a receivable position contracts in a payable position other financial instrument contracts contracts in a receivable position contracts in a payable position foreign exchange trading revenue related to foreign exchange contracts was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in  state street also recorded million from deutsche bank as foreign exchange trading revenue 
for other financial instrument contracts  there were losses of million in  million in and million in recorded in processing fees and other revenue 
future cash requirements  if any  related to foreign currency contracts are represented by the gross amount of currencies to be exchanged under each contract unless state street and the counterparty have agreed to pay or receive the net contractual settlement amount on the settlement date 
future cash requirements on other financial instruments are limited to the net amounts payable under the agreements 
note commitments and off balance sheet activities credit related financial instruments include indemnified securities on loan  commitments to extend credit or purchase assets and standby letters of credit 
the total potential loss on undrawn commitments  standby and commercial letters of credit and securities lending indemnifications is equal to the total contractual amount  which does not consider the value of any collateral 
the following is a summary of the contractual amount of credit related  off balance sheet financial instruments at december dollars in millions indemnified securities on loan liquidity asset purchase agreements loan commitments standby letters of credit on behalf of its clients  state street lends securities to creditworthy banks  broker dealers and other institutions 
in certain circumstances  state street may indemnify its clients for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities 
collateral funds resulting from state street s securities lending services are held by state street as agent  therefore  under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  these assets are not assets of the corporation 
state street requires the borrowers to provide collateral in an amount equal to or in excess of of the fair market value of the securities borrowed 
the borrowed securities are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary 
state street held  as agent  cash and us government securities totaling billion and billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at december  and  respectively 
loan commitments unfunded loans and unused lines of credit  liquidity asset purchase agreements and standby letters of credit are issued to accommodate the financing  liquidity and credit enhancement needs of state street s clients 
loan commitments are agreements by state street to lend monies at a future date 
liquidity asset purchase agreements are commitments to purchase receivables or securities  subject to conditions established in the agreements 
these loan  liquidity asset purchase and letter of credit commitments are subject to the same credit policies and reviews as loans 
approximately of the loan commitments and asset purchase agreements expire within one year from the date of issue 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire or renew without being drawn  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
state street provides liquidity and credit enhancement facilities in the form of liquidity asset purchase agreements  lines of credit  and standby letters of credit to two types of off balance sheet entities 
one type  special purpose entities spes  as defined by fin r  which are administered by state street  issues asset backed commercial paper abcp 
at december  and  state street s commitments under liquidity asset purchase agreements and lines of credit to these spes were billion and billion  respectively  and standby letters of credit were million and million  respectively 
amounts committed  but unused  under the liquidity asset purchase agreements  lines of credit and standby letters of credit that state street provides to these spes are included in the table above 
during the year ended december   million was drawn under a liquidity asset purchase agreement 
asset performance deterioration or certain other factors may cause the asset risk to shift from the abcp investors to state street as the liquidity provider for the asset purchase agreements  as the spe may need to repay maturing commercial paper by drawing the liquidity facilities 
state street would acquire the assets at fair market value at the date of transfer 
potential losses  if any  from these spes are not expected to materially affect the financial condition or results of operations of the corporation 
for a second type of off balance sheet entity  structured as qualified special purpose entities qspes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  state street distributes and sells equity interests in tax exempt investment grade assets to mutual fund clients 
for these qspes  state street transfers the assets from its investment portfolio at fair market value 
such transfers are treated as sales 
for the years ended  and state street sold million  million and million of investment securities  respectively  to the qspes 
the qspes finance the acquisition of these assets by selling equity interests to third party investors 
state street owns a minority residual interest in these qspes of less than  or million 
as of december   these trusts have a weighted average life of approximately years 
in a separate agreement  state street provides liquidity asset purchase agreements to these entities 
these liquidity asset purchase agreements obligate state street to buy the equity interests in the underlying portfolio at par value  which approximates market value  in the event that the re marketing agent is unable to place the equity interests of the qspe with investors 
the liquidity asset purchase agreements are subject to early termination by state street in the event of payment default  bankruptcy of issuer or credit enhancement provider  taxability  or downgrade of an asset below investment grade 
fee revenue for administrative services  liquidity asset purchase agreements and residual interest earnings before tax benefit totaled million in in connection with state street s balance sheet management activities  the corporation incurred million of interest expense on interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges against the minority residual interest of the qspes 
as of december   these qspes had total assets of billion in an estimated tax exempt market of billion to billion 
state street s liquidity asset purchase agreements to these qspes were billion at december   none of which were utilized  and are included in the preceding table 
during and  state street acquired and transferred approximately million and billion  respectively  of investment securities out of its available for sale portfolio at fair market value in exchange for cash to an off balance sheet entity structured as a qspe 
these transfers were treated as sales 
state street provides investment management services to this unaffiliated qspe 
note fair value of financial instruments state street uses the following methods to estimate the fair value of financial instruments 
for financial instruments that have quoted market prices  those quotes are used to determine fair value 
financial instruments that have no defined maturity  have a remaining maturity of days or less  or reprice frequently to a market rate are assumed to have a fair value that approximates reported book value  after taking into consideration any applicable credit risk 
if no market quotes are available  financial instruments are valued by discounting the expected cash flow s using an estimated current market interest rate for the financial instrument 
for derivative instruments  fair value is estimated as the amount at which an asset or liability could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties  other than in a forced liquidation or sale 
the short maturity of state street s assets and liabilities results in a significant number of financial instruments for which fair value equals or closely approximates reported balance sheet value 
such financial instruments are reported in the following balance sheet captions cash and due from banks  interest bearing deposits with banks  securities purchased under resale agreements  federal funds sold  deposits  securities sold under repurchase agreements  federal funds purchased and other short term borrowings 
the fair value of trading account assets equals the carrying value 
there is no reported cost for loan commitments since terms are at prevailing market rates 
the reported value and fair value for other balance sheet captions as of december were as follows reported value fair value dollars in millions investment securities available for sale held to maturity net loans excluding leases unrealized gains on derivative instruments trading long term debt unrealized losses on derivative instruments trading investment securities available for sale held to maturity net loans excluding leases unrealized gains on derivative instruments trading long term debt unrealized losses on derivative instruments trading note non us activities non us activities  as defined by the securities and exchange commission  are considered to be those revenue producing assets and transactions that arise from clients domiciled outside the united states 
due to the nature of state street s business  precise segregation of us and non us activities is not possible 
subjective judgments have been used to arrive at the operating results for non us activities  including the application of tax transfer pricing and asset liability management policies 
interest expense allocations are based on the average cost of short term borrowed funds
