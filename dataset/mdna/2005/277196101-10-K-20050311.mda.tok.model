item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis is intended to assist the reader in evaluating and understanding the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of eastern virginia bankshares  inc the following analysis provides information about the major components of the results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources of eastern virginia bankshares and attempts to identify trends and material changes that occurred during the reporting periods 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data item above and the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements item below 
forward looking statements certain information contained in this discussion may include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these forward looking statements are generally identified by phrases such as the company expects  the company believes or words of similar import 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks including  but not limited to interest rate fluctuations risk inherent in making loans such as repayment risks and fluctuating collateral values changes in banking and other laws and regulations applicable to the company changes in general economic and business conditions 
table of contents competition within and from outside the banking industry new products and services in the banking industry problems with technology utilized by the company changing trends in customer profiles and behavior integration of newly acquired branches or businesses the ability to successfully manage growth or the implementation of growth strategies although the company believes that its expectations with respect to the forward looking statements are based upon reliable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its business and operations  there can be no assurance that actual results  performance or achievements of the company will not differ materially from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies general the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
for example  we use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ substantially from the historical factors that we use 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting i statement of financial accounting standards number  accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable and ii sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of the collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
the company evaluates loans individually for impairment that are non performing  such as loans on nonaccrual  loans past due days or more  restructured loans and other loans selected by management as required by sfas no 
the evaluations are based upon discounted expected cash flows or collateral valuations 
if the evaluation shows that a loan is individually impaired  then a specific reserve is established for the amount of the impairment 
if a loan evaluated individually is not impaired  then the loan is assessed for impairment under sfas no 
for loans without individual measures of impairment  the company makes estimates of losses for groups of loans as required by sfas no 
loans are grouped by similar characteristics  including the type of loan  the assigned loan grade and general collateral type 
a loss rate reflecting the expected loss inherent in a group of loans is derived based upon historical loss rates for each loan type  the predominant collateral type for the group and the terms of the loan 
the resulting estimate of losses for groups of loans are adjusted for relevant environmental factors and other conditions of the portfolio of loans including borrower or industry concentrations  levels and trends in delinquencies  charge offs and recoveries  changes in risk selection  level of experience  ability and depth of lending staff  and national and economic conditions 
the amounts of estimated losses for loans individually evaluated for impairment and groups of loans are added 
table of contents together for a total estimate of loan losses 
the estimate of losses is compared to the allowance for loan losses of the company as of the evaluation date and  if the estimate of losses is greater that the allowance  an additional provision to the allowance would be made 
if the estimate of losses is less than the allowance  the degree to which the allowance exceeds the estimate is evaluated to determine whether a reduction to the allowance would be necessary 
while management uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the valuations 
such adjustments would be made in the relevant period and may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
executive overview eastern virginia bankshares evb reported record net income and earnings per share for the year ended december  as it received a full year of benefits from a new branch office opened in the first quarter of and three branches purchased from bb t first virginia bank hampton roads in september  the company had net income of million  or per share on a basic and per share on a diluted basis  up from million or per share on both a basic and diluted basis for return on average assets roa for was compared to in the prior year  and the return on average equity roe was for compared to in core earnings continued to improve as net interest income increased by and noninterest income increased from the prior year  but this was largely offset by a increase in noninterest expenses 
just as the company received the benefit from the loan and deposit growth generated by the new branch office and the three purchased branches in  it also endured a full year of expenses related to staffing for salaries and benefits  depreciation of the acquired assets  and amortization of core deposit premium paid on the deposits acquired 
these branches accounted for nearly half of the overall increase in noninterest expense 
another primary contributor to the increase in noninterest expenses was the company s constant focus on growing the internal infrastructure to provide a solid base for future growth through both the normal course of business and possible future acquisitions 
evb started a re engineering plan in late to gain best practices among its three bank subsidiaries 
prior to the re engineering plan  each bank  and in some cases each branch  had entirely different procedures for processing transactions at the bank level 
each bank also had its own separate human resources department  accounting department  and bond portfolio management 
the three banks were brought together to discuss each transaction that occurs in the branch to come up with the best procedure among them  which evb refers to as best practices 
the company spent considerable time in and early completing these best practices and also consolidating the individual departments listed above 
this was considered phase i of the re engineering plan in which the company spent approximately thousand in consulting fees 
evb spent the second half of focused on complying with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of sox with respect to internal controls over financial reporting 
the company devoted its available internal resources  as well as using external expertise  to ensure it was in compliance with sox by the mandatory deadline of december  the legislation of sox has had a significant impact on all publicly traded companies and the hard dollar cost of compliance has had a significant impact to the company s earnings with estimates of thousand spent in consulting fees  thousand in overtime pay  and another thousand in salaries and benefits of hiring several additional staff members to meet stricter internal control documentation requirements 
evb had not anticipated the cost of sox compliance as being this great in its forecast 
the compliance with the requirements of sox also delayed phase ii of the re engineering plan that was anticipated to begin in late phase ii consists of the final consolidation of remaining back office functions such as loan operations  branch operations and credit review that are still separate departments at each of the three bank subsidiaries 
the company does not expect phase ii to have the same impact on internal resources as sox  but it is expected that the first half of will continue to have heavy concentration on internal initiatives 
phase ii of the re engineering plan is the final phase and is expected to be complete in the third quarter of with estimated costs of thousand related to consulting fees 

table of contents as phase ii becomes complete  the company believes that it will have an even stronger foundation and will have capitalized on all the opportunities for internal operating efficiencies 
due to the impact of phase ii of the re engineering plan and the needed internal focus for completion  the company is expecting moderate growth in the completion of the re engineering plan in sets the pace for an exciting evb anticipates shifting its internal focus to company wide growth in late and into results of operations the table below lists the company s quarterly performance for the years ended december  and summary of financial results by quarter dollars in thousands three months ended dec

for comparative purposes  income from tax exempt securities is adjusted to a tax equivalent basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 
tax exempt securities income is further adjusted by the tefra adjustment for the disallowance as a deduction of a portion of total interest expense related to the ratio of average tax exempt securities to average total assets 
this adjustment results in tax exempt income and yields being presented on a basis comparable with income and yields from fully taxable earning assets 
net interest margin represents the company s net interest income divided by average earning assets 
changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as their respective yields and rates  have a significant impact on the level of net interest income 
the average balances  income and expense  yields and rates table presents average balances  related interest income and expense  and average yield cost data for each of the past three years 
the volume and rate analysis that follows reflects changes in interest income and interest expense resulting from changes in average volume and average rates

nonaccrual loans have been included in the computations of average loan balances 
interest rate spread is the average yield on earning assets  calculated on a fully taxable basis  less the average rate incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin is the net interest income  calculated on a fully taxable basis assuming a federal income tax rate of  expressed as a percentage of average earning assets 
large dollar certificates of deposit are certificates issued in amounts of  or greater 
tax equivalent net interest income increased in to million from million in average earning asset growth of produced million of increased interest income  and thousand of increased interest expense  or  were the primary factors in the increase in net interest income 
the company had a net interest margin of for  a fourteen basis point decrease from in yield on earning assets decreased basis points to in from in  while the cost of interest bearing funds decreased 
table of contents basis points from in to in the yield on earning assets decrease exceeding the decrease in cost of funds caused the fourteen basis point decrease in net interest margin

interest sensitivity evb s primary goals in interest rate risk management are to minimize negative fluctuations in net interest margin as a percentage of earning assets and to increase the dollar amount of net interest income at a growth rate consistent with the growth rate of total assets 
these goals are accomplished by managing the interest sensitivity gap  which is the difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities in a specific time interval 
interest sensitivity gap is managed by balancing the volume of floating rate liabilities with a similar volume of floating rate assets  by keeping the average maturity of fixed rate asset and liability contracts reasonably consistent and short  and by routinely adjusting pricing to market conditions on a regular basis 
the company generally strives to maintain a position flexible enough to move to equality between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities  which may be desirable when there are wide and frequent fluctuations in 
table of contents interest rates 
matching the amount of assets and liabilities maturing in the same time interval helps to hedge interest rate risk and to minimize the impact on net interest income in periods of rising or falling interest rates 
when an unacceptable positive gap within a one year time frame occurs  maturities can be extended by selling shorter term investments and purchasing longer maturities 
when an unacceptable negative gap occurs  variable rate loans can be increased and more investment in shorter term investments can be made 
interest rate gaps are managed through investments  loan pricing and deposit pricing 
management of the interest rate gap has become much more challenging in the current environment when many depositors have chosen to move funds from certificates of deposit with a maturity of greater than one year to non maturity interest bearing savings  money market and now accounts 
while this customer change in deposit preference favorably impacts the current interest rate margin  it creates a liability sensitive balance sheet  as more liabilities are subject to short term interest rate increases than the amount of assets subject to the same short term increases 
noninterest income noninterest income increased by thousand or from million in to million in service charges on deposit accounts  the largest source of noninterest income  increased thousand or from million in to million in other operating income increased thousand or from million in to million in other operating income includes a thousand increase in bank owned life insurance  which was a new balance sheet category in the second half of  and thousand of income from evb mortgage  which was a joint venture entered into during the first quarter of with southern trust mortgage

noninterest income increased thousand or from to  attributable to a thousand increase in service charges on deposits  a thousand increase in other operating income  and an thousand increase in realized gain on sale of securities 
the following table shows the components of noninterest income for the periods indicated 
noninterest income years ended december dollars in thousands service charges on deposit accounts gain loss on securities other operating income noninterest expense total noninterest expense increased million or from million in to million in salaries and benefits accounted for million of the increase  increasing to million in compared to million in the increase in salaries and benefits was the result of additions to staff related to the opening of the new gloucester point office that opened in late first quarter and the acquisition of three new offices divested by bb t first virginia bank hampton roads in the fourth quarter of evb had a full year impact in for staff additions at these branches 
in addition  several staff members were added to comply with internal control compliance related to sox and to add additional infrastructure to position the company for future growth 
other personnel expenses included a thousand or increase in pension expense related to adding the hanover bank subsidiary and the staff of the three branches acquired in september to the pension plan  a thousand or increase in employee medical insurance  and normal increases in salaries and other benefits 
the total number of officers and staff increased by or to at year end  compared to at year end 
table of contents net occupancy and equipment expense increased thousand or to million for  from million in the primary contributor to the increase was related to a full year of expenses for the three branches purchased from the bb t first virginia bank hampton roads divesture 
they accounted for thousand of the overall increase in net occupancy and equipment expense 
other operating expenses increased thousand or to million in from million in primary contributors to this expense increase were thousand of amortization of core deposit premium related to the acquisition of million of deposits as part of the branch offices purchased from the bb t first virginia bank hampton roads divesture  data processing fees of thousand related to enterprise licensing fees associated with technology growth  and thousand in telephone expense and thousand in courier expense related to the four new branch offices opened and acquired in evb spent approximately thousand in consultant fees related to complying with the sarbanes oxley act of while budgeting only thousand 
the cost of complying with sox was significant to the company and it is estimated that the reoccurring annual cost will be thousand to maintain compliance

loan portfolio loans  net of unearned income  increased to million at december   up million or from million at year end the real estate loan portfolio increased by million while the remainder of the loan portfolio decreased by million 
the primary contributor to low loan growth is the fact that evb s top loan officers spent a better part of the year focusing on sarbanes oxley compliance 
each of the loan officers had an integral part in documenting  reviewing  and approving the internal controls in loan operations 
this impact on loan growth was and is expected to be only temporary as the company surpasses the initial implementation requirements of sox 
at year end  loans  net of unearned income  were million  up million or from million at year end loan growth in was primarily in the real estate portfolio which provided million of the million increase 
the following table shows the composition of the loan portfolio for the periods indicated 
years ended december dollars in thousands commercial  industrial and agricultural loans residential real estate mortgage real estate construction commercial real estate consumer loans all other loans total loans less unearned income total loans net of unearned discount less allowance for loan losses net loans remaining maturities of selected loans year ended december  in thousands variable rate fixed rate within year to years after years total to years after years total total maturities commercial agricultural real estate construction 
table of contents approximately of evb s loan portfolio at december  was comprised of loans secured by real estate 
residential real estate mortgages made up of the loan portfolio at that date as compared to at year end and at year end commercial real estate loans increased from of the total loan portfolio at year end to at year end real estate construction loans accounted for of total loans outstanding at year end and at year end the company s losses on loans secured by real estate have historically been low  averaging thousand in net charge offs per year over the last five years 
consumer loans are the second largest component of evb s loan portfolio 
consumer loans were of the loan portfolio at year end  and and at year end and respectively 
this portfolio component consists primarily of installment loans 
net consumer loans for household  family and other personal expenditures totaled million at year end  down million from million at year end 
general economic conditions and intense competition including zero interest financing by the automotive industry continued the trend that started in  decreasing consumer loans both in absolute amount and percentage of the total loan portfolio 
commercial and agricultural loans are designed specifically to meet the needs of small and medium size business customers 
this category of loans decreased million in total loans outstanding at year end compared to  with the percentage to total loans decreasing to of the total loan portfolio from at year end consistent with its focus on providing community based financial services  evb generally does not make loans outside of its principal market region 
the company does not engage in foreign lending activities  consequently the loan portfolio is not exposed to the sometimes volatile risk from foreign credits 
evb further maintains a policy not to originate or purchase loans classified by regulators as highly leveraged transactions or loans to foreign entities or individuals 
the company s unfunded loan commitments  excluding credit card lines and letters of credit  at year end totaled million  up million from million at december  unfunded loan commitments excluding million in home equity lines are used in large part to meet seasonal funding needs which are generally higher from spring through fall than at year end 
historically  evb s loan collateral has been primarily real estate because of the nature of our market region 
asset quality the company s allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the amount needed to provide for potential losses in the loan portfolio 
in determining adequacy of the allowance  management considers the company s historical loss experience  the size and composition of the loan portfolio  specific impaired loans  the overall level of nonaccrual loans  the value and adequacy of collateral and guarantors  experience and depth of lending staff  effects of credit concentrations and economic conditions 
the allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses  which is charged to expense and reduced by charge offs  net of recoveries 
because the risk of loan loss includes general economic trends as well as conditions affecting individual borrowers  the allowance for loan losses can only be an estimate 
evb s ratio of nonperforming assets increased slightly in to a nonperforming asset level of at year end  compared to at year end actual nonperforming assets increased to million at year end  compared to million at year end net charge offs for increased thousand or to million  compared to thousand for the year 
each of evb s subsidiary banks has a loan review function consisting of bank officers and board members 
additionally an independent credit review firm performs a review of loans for each of the banks  including a sfas review for determining specific reserves 
the company utilizes a risk based evaluation system based on loan type  collateral and payment history to determine the amount of the allowance for loan losses 
management believes the allowance for loan losses to be adequate based on this loan review process and analysis 
the company s decreased loan growth in allowed evb to lower its loan loss allowance ratio to at year end  compared to at december  and at year end  respectively 
for the same dates  the loan loss allowance to nonaccrual loans ratio was  and  indicating that the allowance was 
table of contents adequate with respect to nonaccrual loans 
the allowance for loan losses is subject to regulatory examinations which may take into account such factors as methodology used to calculate the allowance and the size of the allowance in comparison to peer companies identified by regulatory agencies

table of contents and is currently in the process of foreclosure 
the company expects a full recovery of the loan balance based on the value of the collateral being well in excess of the loan amount 
excluding this one loan from the nonperforming asset calculation would have reduced the nonperforming assets to million or of total loans at year end nonperforming loans at year end consisted of million of loans secured by real estate in the company s market area  thousand of commercial and agricultural loans and thousand of consumer loans 
based on estimated fair values of the related collateral  management considers the nonperforming real estate loans recoverable  with any individual deficiency well covered by the allowance for loan losses 
the total amount of unsecured nonaccrual loans was thousand 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status at the time when the collection of principal and interest are considered to be doubtful 
no interest is accrued on loans placed in a nonaccrual status  and any unpaid interest previously accrued on such loans is reversed when a loan is placed in nonaccrual status 
if interest on nonaccrual loans had been accrued  such income would have approximated thousand and thousand for the years and  respectively

although trends for credit quality factors continued to be stable  it is likely that evb will continue provisions for loan losses in the primary factor for additional provision is growth in the loan portfolio and the level of net charge offs and nonperforming loans 
at december   the company s subsidiary banks reported million in impaired loans 
loans are viewed as impaired based upon individual evaluations of discounted expected cash flows or collateral valuations 
these loans are subject to constant management attention  and their status is reviewed on a regular basis 
securities securities available for sale include those securities that may be sold in response to changes in market interest rates  changes in the security s prepayment risk  increases in loan demand  general liquidity needs  and other similar factors  and are carried at estimated fair market value

see note to the consolidated financial statements see item below for an analysis of gross unrealized gains and losses in the securities portfolio 
deposits the company has historically focused on increasing core deposits to reduce the need for other borrowings to fund growth in earning assets 
core deposits provide a low cost  stable source of funding for the company s asset growth 
interest rates paid on deposits are carefully managed to provide an attractive market rate while at the same time not adversely affecting the net interest margin 
borrowing through the federal home loan bank of atlanta is utilized for funding when the cost of borrowed funds falls below the cost of new interest bearing deposits 

table of contents evb experienced slower deposit growth in  as the company spent less effort to attract higher rate deposits due to the company having excess deposits as a result of the million of deposits acquired versus the million in loans acquired from the purchase of three branches in the bb t first virginia bank hampton roads divesture in september total deposits at december  of million reflected an increase of million or compared to million at year end 
noninterest bearing deposits increased million or to million at year end compared to million at december  during the same period  interest bearing deposits increased to million at year end  compared to million at december  while these figures are as of a specific day at year end  it is also meaningful to review average deposits for the year

capital represents original investment by shareholders along with retained earnings and provides financial resources over which management can exercise greater control as compared to deposits and borrowed funds 

table of contents regulatory authorities have adopted guidelines to establish minimum capital standards 
specifically the guidelines classify assets and balance sheet items into four risk weighted categories 
the minimum regulatory total capital to risk weighted assets is  of which at least must be tier capital  defined as common equity and retained earnings  plus trust preferred debt up to of tier capital  less goodwill and intangibles 
at december   evb had a total capital ratio of and a tier ratio of  both far in excess of regulatory guidelines and the amount needed to support each subsidiary s banking business 
capital is carefully managed as the financial opportunities of a high capital base are weighed against the impact of the return on equity ratio 
in january  the company announced a stock repurchase program intended to reduce high capital levels and to increase return on equity to shareholders 
the company repurchased  shares in   shares in   shares in  and  shares in the following table provides an analysis of the company s capital as of december    and note in the consolidated financial statements see item below presents an analysis of the capital position of each of the subsidiary banks as of year end  and analysis of capital december dollars in thousands tier capital common stock retained earnings total equity trust preferred debt less goodwill and intangibles total tier capital tier capital allowance for loan losses total risk based capital risk weighted assets capital ratios tier risk based capital total risk based capital tier capital to average total assets off balance sheet arrangements at december   the company had million of off balance sheet credit exposure in the form of million of commitments to grant loans and unfunded commitments under lines of credit  million of standby letters of credit and thousand of private label credit card guarantees 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
the commitments for equity lines of credit may expire without being drawn upon 
therefore  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the amount of collateral obtained  if it is deemed necessary by the company  is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer 
unfunded commitments under commercial lines of credit  revolving credit lines and overdraft protection agreements are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers 
these lines of credit are usually uncollateralized and do not always contain a specified maturity date and may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which the company is committed 

table of contents standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
the company generally holds collateral supporting those commitments if deemed necessary 
liquidity liquidity represents an institution s ability to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management 
liquid assets include cash  deposits with other banks  federal funds sold  investments and loans maturing or repricing within one year 
evb s management of liquid assets provides a liquidity level which management believes is sufficient to satisfy its depositors requirements and to meet its customers credit needs 
at december   million or of total earning assets were due to mature or reprice within the next year 
evb also maintains additional sources of liquidity through a variety of borrowing arrangements 
federal funds borrowing arrangements with major regional banks combined with lines of credit with the federal home loan bank totaled million at december  at year end  the company had million of fhlb borrowings outstanding 
no new fhlb borrowings occurred in the following table presents the company s contractual obligations and scheduled payment amounts due at various intervals over the next five years and beyond 
contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period dollars in thousands total less than year years years over years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total inflation in financial institutions  unlike most manufacturing companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a bank s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rate movement is not necessarily tied to movements in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services  since such prices are affected by inflation to a larger extent than interest rates

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates and equity prices 
evb s market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
the company s management is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of evb s subsidiary banks and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
guidelines established by management are reviewed by the board of directors 
it is evb s policy not to engage in activities considered to be derivative in nature such as futures  option contracts  swaps  caps  floors  collars or forward commitments 
evb considers derivatives as speculative which is contrary to the company s historical or prospective philosophy 

table of contents evb does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
it does hold in its loan and security portfolio investments that adjust or float according to changes in the prime lending rate which is not considered speculative  but necessary for good asset liability management 
asset liability risk management the primary goals of asset liability risk management are to maximize net interest income and the net value of evb s future cash flows within the interest rate limits set by the company s asset liability committee alco 
interest rate risk measurement interest rate risk is monitored through the use of three complementary measures static gap analysis  earnings simulation modeling and net present value estimation 
while each of the interest rate risk measurements has limitations  taken together they represent a reasonably comprehensive view of the magnitude of interest rate risk in the company  the distribution of risk along the yield curve  the level of risk through time  and the amount of exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships 
static gap gap analysis measures the amount of repricing risk embedded in the balance sheet at a point in time 
it does so by comparing the differences in the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
a gap is defined as the difference between the principal amount of assets and liabilities  adjusted for off balance sheet instruments  which reprice within a specific time period 
the cumulative one year gap at year end was which is within the policy limit for the one year gap of plus to minus of total earning assets at a combined company level 
core deposits and loans with noncontractual maturities are included in the gap repricing distributions based upon historical patterns determined by statistical analysis  based upon industry accepted assumptions including the most recent core deposit defaults set forth by the ffiec federal financial institutions examination council 
the gap repricing distributions include principal cash flows from residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities in the time frames in which they are expected to be received 
mortgage prepayments are estimated by applying industry median projections of prepayment speeds to portfolio segments based on coupon range and loan age 
earnings simulation the earnings simulation model forecasts one year net income under a variety of scenarios that incorporate changes in the absolute level of interest rates  changes in the shape of the yield curve and changes in interest rate relationships 
management evaluates the effects on income of alternative interest rate scenarios against earnings in a stable interest rate environment 
this type of analysis is also most useful in determining the short run earnings exposures to changes in customer behavior involving loan payments and deposit additions and withdrawals 
the most recent earnings simulation model projects net income would increase approximately of stable rate net income if rates were to fall immediately by basis points 
it projects a decrease of approximately if rates rise by basis points 
management believes this reflects a liability sensitive interest risk for the one year horizon 
this dynamic simulation model includes assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to evolve through time  in different interest rate environments 
loan and deposit growth rate assumptions are derived from historical analysis and management s outlook  as are the assumptions used to project yields and rates for new loans and deposits 
all maturities  calls and prepayments in the securities portfolio are assumed to be reinvested in like instruments 
mortgage loan prepayment assumptions are developed from industry median estimates of prepayment speeds for portfolios with similar coupon ranges and seasoning 
noncontractual deposit growth rates and pricing are assumed to follow historical patterns 
the sensitivities of key assumptions are analyzed at least annually and reviewed by management 

table of contents net present value the net present value npv of the balance sheet  at a point in time  is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows minus the discounted value of liability cash flows 
interest rate risk analysis using npv involves changing the interest rates used in determining the cash flows and in discounting the cash flows 
the resulting percentage change in npv is an indication of the longer term repricing risk and options embedded in the balance sheet 
at year end  a basis point immediate increase in rates is estimated to decrease npv by 
additionally  npv is estimated to increase by if rates fall immediately by basis points 
analysis of the average quarterly change in the treasury yield curve over the past ten years indicates that a parallel curve shift of basis points or more is an event that has less than a chance of occurrence 
as with gap analysis and earnings simulation modeling  assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are critical in npv analysis 
particularly important are the assumptions driving mortgage prepayments and the assumptions about expected attrition of the core deposit portfolios 
these assumptions are applied consistently across the different rate risk measures
