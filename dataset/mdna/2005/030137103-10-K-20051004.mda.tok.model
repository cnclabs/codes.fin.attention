in response to customers requirements for shorter lead times and faste r deliveries  the company has increased its inventories of finished goods of certain products 
the company believes that this practice has led to increased orders from certain customers and greater market share 
gross margins improved in fiscal year compared to fiscal year as operating at higher volumes enabled the company to realize efficiencies of scale 
some of the increased demand was met using available capacity on existin g machinery 
however  the company also expanded capacity to meet some of the increased demand and to position itself for additional growth 
as a result  fixed overhead increased which offset some of the improvement in gross margin

to the extent the company can reduce the costs to produce these products  it can compete more effectively 
the company devotes considerable effort to research and development designed to effect process improvements 
research and development expense decreased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  due to certain personnel being redesignated as production support as certain projects entered the production stage 
bookings continued to grow during fiscal year  particularly with respect to our newer product lines 
the increases in bookings resulted from strong demand from the wireless infrastructure  semiconductor equipment  military and medical markets

critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission sec has issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require the application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and ma y change in subsequent periods 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to its consolidated financial statements contained in item financial statements and supplementary data of this report 
the company believes that the following accounting policies require the application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments allowances for doubtful accounts receivable the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and a customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by its review of the customer s current credit information 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from it s customers and maintains an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon its historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that the company has identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within the company s expectations and the allowances established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that i t has in the past 
should the financial position of its customers deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to pay amounts due  the company s revised estimate of such losses and any actual losses in excess of previous estimates may negatively impact its operating results 
sales returns and allowances in the ordinary course of business  the company accepts returns of products sold for various reasons and grants sales allowances to customers 
while the company engages in extensive product quality control programs and processes  its level of sales returns is affected by  among other things  the quality of its manufacturing processes 
the company maintains an allowance for sales returns and allowances based upon historical returns and allowances granted 
while such returns and allowances have historically been within the company s expectations  actual return and allowance rates in the future may differ from current estimates  which could negatively impact its operating results 
inventory valuation the company values inventory at the lower of aggregate cost first in  first out or market 
when the cost of inventory is determined by management to be in excess of its market value  such inventory is written down to its estimated net realizable value 
this requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about several factors eg  future sales quantities and selling prices  and percentage complete and failure rates for work in process based upon historical experience and its projections for future periods 
changes in factors such as the level of order bookings  the product mix of order bookings and the company s manufacturing processes could have a material impact on the company s assessment of the net realizable value of inventory in the future 
valuation of deferred tax assets the company regularly evaluates its ability to recover the reported amount of its deferred income taxes considering several factors  including its estimate of the likelihood of the company generating sufficient taxable income in future years during the period over which temporary differences reverse 
management also considers the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities  th e company s historic taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and the expected future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible as well as reversals of deferred tax liabilities  management believes  although there can be no assurance  that it is more likely than not that the company will realize the net benefits of these deductible differences 
the company has available state net operating loss carry forwards in florida  which expire in various years through due to uncertainties about the realization of these loss carryforwards  a valuation allowance has been provide d against the associated deferred tax asset 
in the event that actual results differ from its estimates  or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods  the company may need to establish additional valuation allowances against a portion or all of its deferred tax assets  which could materially impact its financial position or results of operations in future periods 
valuation of long lived assets the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets whenever the company determines that events or changes in circumstances indicate that th e carrying amount may not be recoverable 
its assessment is primarily based upon its estimate of future cash flows associated with these assets 
the company believes that the carrying amount of its long lived assets is recoverable 
however  should its operating results deteriorate  or anticipated new product launches not occur or not attain the commercial acceptance that the company anticipates  the company may determine that some portion of its long lived assets are impaired 
such determination could result in non cash charges to income that could materially affect the company s financial position or results of operations for that period 
inflation the company does not expect the effects of inflation to have a significant impact on its liquidity or results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has identified four market risks relative to its business foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk  security price risk and interest rate risk 
the company has managed its market risk exposures in order to minimize their potential impact on its consolidated financial conditio n and results of operations 
specifically a foreign currency exchange rate risk 
with the exception of transaction s by the company s wholly owned subsidiary in sweden which are denominated in krona  all transactions are  and are anticipated to be denominated in us dollars 
fluctuations in exchange rates could impact revenues with an offsetting impact on costs and expenses 
the company does not believe that the impact on net earnings of a shif t in exchange rates would be material 
b commodity price risk 
the company uses certain precious metals in the manufacturing of its products primarily palladium  gold and silver  and is therefore subject to certain commodity price risks 
the price o f precious metals have begun to rise due to the higher demand coming fro m the electronics industry and other industries 
consequently  the company has purchased a quantity of these metals to protect against rising prices 
the company believes that  based upon its current level s of production and inventories of precious metals  it has a sufficient supply of precious metals such that the company would not have to buy any additional quantities for the next six months 
c security price risk 
the company s current portfolio of marketable securities consists of us treasury notes and other government securities with maturities of less than one year 
the company believes it can effectively manage any exposure resulting from declining prices by holding any securities which decline substantially in value until maturity 
d interest rate risk 
the company earns interest income on cash and investment balances and pays interest on debt incurred 
in light of th e company s existing cash  results of operations  the terms of its debt obligations and projected capital needs  it does not believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant impact on its consolidated financial position
