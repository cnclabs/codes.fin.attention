item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations 
losses and loss adjustment expense reserves the cost to settle a customer s claim is comprised of two major components losses and loss adjustment expenses lae 
losses in connection with third party coverages represent damages as a result of an insured s acts that result in property damage or bodily injury 
first party losses involve damage or injury to the insured s property or person 
in either case  the ultimate cost of the loss is not always immediately known and  over time  may be higher or lower than initially estimated 
when establishing initial and subsequent estimates  the amount of loss is reduced for salvage eg  proceeds from the disposal of the wrecked automobile and subrogation eg  proceeds from another party who is fully or partially liable  such as the insurer of the driver who caused the accident involving one of our customers 
loss adjustment expenses represent the costs of adjusting  investigating and settling claims  and are primarily comprised of the cost of our claims department  external inspection services  and internal and external legal counsel 
corporate support areas such as human resources  finance  and information technology provide services to our overall operations  and  accordingly  a portion of their operational costs are also allocated to lae 
the lae allocable portion of such corporate support costs is reviewed periodically as changes occur in our organization  and we modify the allocation percentages as appropriate 
during  such changes effectively decreased our ratio of overhead lae to earned premium by percentage points from in to in accounting for losses and lae is highly subjective because these costs must be estimated  often weeks  months or even years in advance of when the payments are actually made to claimants  attorneys  claims personnel and others involved in the claims settlement process 
accounting principles require insurers to record estimates for losses and lae in the periods in which the insured events  such as automobile accidents  occur 
this estimation process requires us to estimate both the number of accidents that have occurred called frequency and the ultimate amount of loss and lae called severity related to each accident 
we employ actuaries who are professionally trained and certified in the process of establishing estimates for frequency and severity 
historically  our actuaries have not projected a range around the carried loss reserves 
rather  they have used several methods and different underlying assumptions to produce a number of point estimates for the required reserves 
management reviews the assumptions underlying the loss ratios and selects the carried reserves after carefully reviewing the appropriateness of the underlying assumptions 
estimating the frequency of auto accidents 
by studying the historical lag between the actual date of loss and the date the accident is reported by the customer to the claims department  our actuaries can make a reasonable  yet never perfect  estimate for the number of claims that ultimately will be reported for a given period 
this measurement is referred to as frequency 
the difference between the estimated ultimate number of claims that will be made and the number that have actually been reported in any given period is referred to as incurred but not reported ibnr claims 
estimating the severity of auto claims 
for both property damage and injury claims our adjusters determine what exposures exist in open reserves 
all property damage reserves and any injury reserves estimated to be less than  are set at average amounts determined by our actuaries 
for both bodily injury and uninsured motorist claims estimated to have value in excess of  adjusters in our claims department establish loss estimates based upon various factors such as the extent of the injuries  property damage sustained  and the age of the claim 
our actuaries review these estimates  giving consideration to the adjusters historical ability to accurately estimate the ultimate claim and length of time it will take to settle the claim  and provide for development in the adjusters estimates as applicable 
generally  the longer it takes to settle a claim  the higher the ultimate claim cost 
the ultimate amount of the loss is considered the severity of the claim 
in addition  the actuaries estimate the severity of the ibnr claims 
the severities are estimated by our actuaries each month based on historical studies of average claim payments and the patterns of how the claims were paid 
again  the fundamental assumption used in making these estimates is that past events are reliable indicators of future outcomes 
estimating losses and lae for lines in runoff 
while the personal auto lines represent our core business  we also have losses and lae relating to development on remaining loss reserves for homeowners and earthquake lines 
these lines are said to be in runoff because we no longer have policies in force 
as discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we have not written any earthquake policies since and we exited the homeowners insurance business at the beginning of developing reserve estimates for the earthquake line is particularly subjective because most of the remaining earthquake claims are in litigation 
our actuaries evaluate the homeowners reserve requirement on a quarterly basis  while personnel in our legal and claims areas prepare monthly evaluations of the earthquake reserves 
loss and lae reserve development management believes that our reserves are adequate and represent our best estimate based on the information currently available 
however  because reserve estimates are necessarily subject to the outcome of future events  changes in estimates are unavoidable in the property and casualty insurance business 
these changes sometimes are referred to as loss development or reserve development 
for the personal auto lines  our actuaries prepare a monthly evaluation of loss and lae indications by accident year  and we assess whether there is a need to adjust reserve estimates 
as claims are reported and settled and as other new information becomes available  changes in estimates are made and are included in earnings of the period of the change 
the changes in prior accident year estimates of losses and lae incurred recorded in each of the past five calendar years  net of reinsurance  are summarized below in thousands changes in the calendar year of prior accident year estimates  net of reinsurance years ended december  personal auto homeowner and earthquake total positive amounts represent deficiencies in loss and lae reserves  while negative amounts represent redundancies 
to understand these changes  it is useful to put them in the context of the cumulative reserve development experienced by the company over a longer time frame 
the tables on the following pages present the development of loss and lae reserves for the personal auto lines table and for the homeowner and earthquake lines in runoff table  for the years through the figures in both tables are shown gross of reinsurance 
we no longer have any california homeowner policies in force 
we ceased writing earthquake coverage in  but we have remaining loss reserves from the northridge earthquake that are subject to possible adverse development 
see further discussion in item under the captions underwriting results homeowner and earthquake lines in runoff  critical accounting estimates  and the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in tables and on the following pages  a redundancy deficiency exists when the original reserve estimate is greater less than the re estimated reserves 
each amount in the tables includes the effects of all changes in amounts for prior periods 
the tables do not present accident year or policy year development data 
conditions and trends that have affected the development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
therefore  it would not be appropriate to extrapolate future deficiencies or redundancies based on the table 
a detailed discussion of loss and lae reserve development follows the tables 
the top line of each table shows the reserves at the balance sheet date for each of the years indicated 
the upper portion of the table indicates the cumulative amounts paid as of subsequent year ends with respect to that reserve liability 
the lower portion of the table indicates the re estimated amount of the previously recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year  including cumulative payments made since the end of the respective year 
the estimates change as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for individual years

see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
auto lines reserve development 
as shown in the ten year development table  our auto lines historically developed redundancies prior to and have exhibited adverse development for through for  there was favorable development of million 
the period from to was quite unusual in that  during that time  we experienced declining frequencies and declining severities in our auto line 
as table shows  we did not immediately have confidence in these declining trends and did not immediately lower our reserve estimates 
much of the decline in trend occurred between and because of moderation in health care costs due to greater use of hmo s and laws that were enacted in california that limited the ability of uninsured motorists and drunk drivers to collect non economic damages 
during  we assumed that the past trend of declining frequencies and severities would continue 
however  in retrospect  it can now be seen that the favorable decline in trends ended and loss costs began to increase 
in  we continued to assume lower loss severity primarily because of what then seemed to be an acceleration in the pattern of claims payments and the uncertainty inherent in identifying a change in multi year patterns 
in  we experienced significant  unexpected development in our uninsured motorist coverage while the actuarial indications for most prior accident years were adjusted upward as more data became available 
the changes in injury trends affected the entire california market and occurred  to a greater or lesser degree  in virtually every state in the country 
starting in  we improved the quality and timeliness of the data available to make initial estimates and periodic changes in estimates 
we have dedicated more resources to better understand the underlying drivers of the changes in frequency and severity trends as they begin emerging 
for example  in the second quarter of we began making accident month actuarial analyses of our reserves for the auto lines 
our improved methodology is reflected in the small favorable development of million recorded in with respect to and prior accident years 
homeowner and earthquake lines in runoff 
in table  substantially all of the development relates to the earthquake line 
a major earthquake occurred on january   centered in the san fernando valley community of northridge the northridge earthquake 
through december   we have settled over  northridge earthquake claims including auto claims at a total cost ie  loss plus lae of over billion 
in september  the state of california enacted senate bill sb  which allowed northridge earthquake claims barred by contract and the statute of limitations to be reopened during calendar year please see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional background on the northridge earthquake and sb  including a discussion of factors that have contributed to the difficulty of obtaining accurate loss and lae estimates in the wake of that legislation 
the loss development in table is easiest to understand by dividing it into pre sb and post sb segments 
this is because the costs relating to the reopened claims are displayed in the table as a event since they all related to the northridge earthquake  even though the legislation allowing the re opening of certain claims was not passed until almost seven years later 
before sb was passed in late  we had only approximately earthquake claims remaining to be resolved out of an initial  homeowner earthquake claims 
although we settled of the claims within a year of the quake  many upward changes in estimates were required in and beyond as new information emerged on the severity of the damages and as settlements of litigated claims occurred 
as a result  we recorded the following upward changes in loss estimates after  but before sb came into play million  million  million  million  million  and million 
calendar year was the one year window sb permitted for claimants to bring additional insurance claims and legal actions allegedly arising out of the northridge earthquake 
prior to the enactment of this law  such claims were considered by previously applicable law to be fully barred  or settled and closed 
any additional legal actions with respect to such claims were barred under the policy contracts  settlement agreements  and or applicable statutes of limitation 
as a result of the enactment of this unprecedented legislation  claimants asserted additional claims against the company allegedly related to damages that occurred in the earthquake but which were now being reported seven years later in plaintiff attorneys and public adjusters conducted extensive advertising campaigns to solicit claimants 
hundreds of claims were filed in the final days and hours before the december  deadline 
during  the company recorded an additional million of pre tax losses related to the earthquake  including million in the fourth quarter to cover the indemnity and inspection portion of the claims 
in the first two quarters of  we expensed an additional million of legal defense costs as they were paid 
the company lacked sufficient information to record a reasonable estimate of the related legal defense costs until the third quarter of  at which time an additional provision of million was recorded 
based on subsequent developments  we recorded an additional provision of million in the first quarter of and million in see additional discussion in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
at the end of each month  legal and claims personnel within the company review the adequacy of the remaining sb reserves based on the most current information available 
based on that review  we believe our remaining earthquake reserves are adequate as of december  more than ninety eight percent of the claims submitted and litigation brought against the company as a result of sb have been resolved 
substantially all of the company s remaining earthquake claims are in litigation 
no class actions have been certified and the trial court has denied class action status for the two remaining cases seeking class action status 
while the reserves established are the company s current best estimate of the cost of resolving its earthquake claims  including claims arising as a result of sb  these reserves continue to be highly uncertain because of the difficulty in predicting how the remaining litigated cases will be resolved 
reinsurance a reinsurance transaction occurs when an insurer transfers or cedes a portion of its exposure to a reinsurer for a premium 
the reinsurance cession does not legally discharge the insurer from its liability for a covered loss  but provides for reimbursement from the reinsurer for the ceded portion of the risk 
we periodically monitor the continuing appropriateness of our reinsurance arrangements to determine that our retention levels are reasonable and that our reinsurers are financially sound  able to meet their obligations under the agreements and that the contracts are competitively priced 
the majority of our cessions are with aig subsidiaries  which have earned am best s highest financial rating of a 
the am best financial ratings of our other reinsurers range from a to a 
our reinsurance arrangements are discussed in more detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our net retention of insurance risk after reinsurance for and the preceding five years is summarized below contracts incepting during net retention auto and motorcycle lines personal umbrella policies homeowner line in runoff we also have catastrophe reinsurance agreements relating to the auto line with endurance specialty insurance company  national union insurance company of pittsburg  pa and transatlantic reinsurance company  which reinsure any covered events up to million in excess of million million in excess of million prior to january  
effective september   we entered into an agreement to cancel future cessions under our quota share with aig subsidiaries 
the treaty would have ceded of premiums for the auto and motorcycle lines to aig subsidiaries in the remainder of and would have declined to in after september   of auto and motorcycle premiums are retained by us 
personal umbrella coverage is only available to our auto customers 
approximately of auto customers have umbrella coverage 
state regulation of insurance companies insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the insurance departments of the various states 
the insurance departments have broad regulatory  supervisory and administrative powers  such as licensing of insurance companies  agents and customer service employees  prior approval  in california and some other jurisdictions  of premium rates  establishment of capital and surplus requirements and standards of solvency  nature of  and limitations on  investments insurers are allowed to hold  periodic examinations of the affairs of insurers  annual and other periodic reports of the financial condition and results of operations of insurers  establishment of statutory accounting rules  issuance of securities by insurers  restrictions on payment of dividends  and restrictions on transactions with affiliates 
currently  the california department of insurance cdi has primary regulatory jurisdiction over our subsidiaries  st century insurance company and st century casualty company  including prior approval of premium rates 
the cdi typically conducts a financial examination of our affairs every three years 
the most recently completed triennial examination  for the three years ended december   contained no findings or adjustments 
in general  the current regulatory requirements in the other states in which our subsidiaries are licensed insurers are less restrictive than in california 
st century insurance company of the southwest formerly st century insurance company of arizona changed its state of domicile from arizona to texas effective december  in addition to regulation by the cdi  the company and the personal lines insurance business in general are also subject to legislative  judicial and political action in addition to the normal business forces of competition between companies and the choices consumers make based on their preferences 
to our knowledge  no new laws were enacted in by any state in which we do business that are expected to have a material impact on the auto insurance industry 
however  during  hearings were conducted by the cdi  which could ultimately result in regulations that would restrict the use of territory in automobile insurance rating 
such regulations  if implemented  could negatively affect our book of business 
holding company regulation our subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the cdi pursuant to the provisions of the california insurance holding company system regulatory act the holding company act 
many transactions defined to be of an extraordinary nature may not be effected without the prior approval of the cdi 
in addition  the holding company act limits the amount of dividends our insurance subsidiaries may pay 
an extraordinary transaction includes a dividend which  together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months  exceeds the greater of i of the insurance company s policyholders surplus as of the preceding december or ii the insurance company s statutory net income for the preceding calendar year 
the insurance subsidiaries currently have million of statutory unassigned surplus 
up to million of this amount could be paid as dividends to the parent company without prior written approval from insurance regulatory authorities in our insurance subsidiaries have not paid any dividends to our holding company since due to the previous uncertainty surrounding the taxability of dividends received by holding companies from their insurance subsidiaries see further discussion in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
non voluntary business automobile liability insurers in california are required to participate in the california automobile assigned risk plan caarp 
drivers whose driving records or other relevant characteristics make them difficult to insure in the voluntary market may be eligible to apply to caarp for placement as assigned risks 
the number of assignments for each insurer is based on the total applications received by the plan and the insurer s market share 
as of december   the number of assigned risk insured vehicles was  compared to  at the end of the caarp assignments have historically produced underwriting losses 
as of december   this business represented less than of our total direct premiums written  and the underwriting losses were million in  million in and million in insurers offering homeowner insurance in california are required to participate in the california fair plan fair plan 
fair plan is a state administered pool of difficult to insure homeowners 
each participating insurer is allocated a percentage of the total premiums written and losses incurred by the pool according to its share of total homeowner direct premiums written in the state 
participation in the current year fair plan operations is based on the pool from two years prior 
since we ceased writing direct homeowners business in  the company will continue to receive assignments in the calendar year 
our fair plan underwriting results for  and were immaterial 
employees we had approximately  full and part time employees at december  we provide medical  pension and k savings plan benefits to eligible employees  according to the provisions of each plan 
debt offering in december  the company completed a private offering of million principal amount of percent senior notes due in december at a discount of million 
the effective interest rate on the senior notes  when all offering costs are taken into account and amortized over the term of the senior notes  is approximately percent per annum 
of the million in net proceeds from the offering  million was used to increase the statutory surplus of st century insurance company  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  and the balance was retained by the holding company 
on april   pursuant to a registration rights agreement executed in connection with the offering  the company filed a registration statement with the sec enabling holders to exchange the private offering notes for publicly registered notes 
on july   the company completed an exchange offer in which all of the private offering notes were exchanged for publicly registered notes having the same terms 
item properties we lease approximately  square feet of office space for our headquarters facilities  which are located in woodland hills  california 
the lease term expires in february  and the lease may be renewed for two consecutive five year periods 
we also lease office space in other locations  of which locations are in california primarily for claims related employees 
we anticipate no difficulty in extending these leases or obtaining comparable office facilities in suitable locations 
our newest location is a customer service  sales and claims center in lewisville  texas 
the facility opened in mid and represents a strategic expansion of our service and sales resources

the increase in the to expense ratios is primarily due to increased advertising expenditures  increased costs for improving customer service and opening a call center in texas 
the increase in the expense ratio from to reflects higher depreciation charges due to investments in new technology

our loss and lae reserves  gross and net of reinsurance  are summarized in the following table amounts in thousands december  gross net gross net unpaid losses and lae personal auto lines homeowner and earthquake lines in runoff total gross unpaid losses and lae increased by million in primarily due to a reserve increase of million in the personal auto lines as a result of growth in our customer base 
the increase in the personal auto lines was offset by the million net decrease in the homeowner and earthquake lines  which are in runoff see results of operations loss and lae incurred for a description of the company s reserving process 
unearned premiums increased to million at the end of compared to million at the end of due to higher volume in our personal auto lines 
debt consists of a million capital lease obligation with ge capital corporation and the million senior note offering issued in december  aggregating million see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the primary purpose of both borrowings was to increase the statutory surplus of st century insurance company  our wholly owned subsidiary  which had significant adverse earthquake and auto reserve development in   and the decrease in debt of million from the prior year is attributable to principal payments on the capital lease 
stockholders equity and book value per share increased to million and  respectively  at december   compared to million and at december  the increase for the year ended december   was primarily due to net income of million  offset by a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income of million and dividends to stockholders of million 
effective december   we changed our state of incorporation from california to delaware 
in connection with the change  our common stock was assigned a par value of per share  resulting in a reclassification of million from common stock to additional paid in capital 
there was no change in the location of company operations  location of employees  or the way we do business as a result of the reincorporation 
liquidity and capital resources st century insurance group 
our holding company s main sources of liquidity historically have been dividends received from our insurance subsidiaries and proceeds from issuance of debt or equity securities 
apart from the exercise of stock options and restricted stock grants to employees  the effects of which have not been significant  we have not issued any equity securities since when aig exercised its warrants to purchase common stock for cash of million 
our insurance subsidiaries have not paid any dividends to our holding company since due to the previous uncertainty surrounding the taxability of dividends received by holding companies from their insurance subsidiaries see further discussion in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in december  we completed a private offering of million principal amount of percent senior notes due in december the effective interest rate on the senior notes when all offering costs are taken into account and amortized over the term of the senior notes is approximately percent per annum 
of the million net proceeds from the offering  million was used to increase the statutory surplus of our wholly owned insurance subsidiary  st century insurance company  and the balance was retained by our holding company 
on july   the company completed an exchange offer in which all of the private offering notes were exchanged for publicly registered notes having the same terms 
effective december   the california department of insurance approved an intercompany lease whereby st century insurance company leases certain computer software from our holding company 
the monthly lease payment  currently million  started in january and is subject to upward adjustment based on the cost incurred by the holding company to complete certain enhancements to the software 
our holding company s significant cash obligations over the next several years consist of interest payments on the senior notes million annually and the estimated cost of million to implement our california policy servicing system in  exclusive of any dividends to stockholders that the holding company may declare  and the repayment of the million principal on the senior notes due in the holding company expects to be able to meet those obligations from sources of cash currently available ie  payments received from the intercompany lease and cash and investments at the holding company 
total cash and investments at the holding company were million at december   additional funds obtainable from the capital markets or from dividends received from its insurance subsidiaries 
california currently levies state income taxes of approximately on the amount of any such dividends received 
our insurance subsidiaries could pay million in as dividends to the holding company without prior written approval from insurance regulatory authorities 
insurance subsidiaries 
we have achieved underwriting profits in our core auto insurance operations for the last twelve quarters and have thereby enhanced our liquidity 
our cash flow from operations and short term cash position generally are more than sufficient to meet obligations for claim payments  which by the nature of the personal automobile insurance business tend to have an average duration of less than a year 
in california  where approximately of our premium is written  underwriting profit improved in without additional rate increases 
we implemented a auto premium rate increase effective march  and a rate increase in may of  both of which continued a series of actions we began taking in to restore underwriting profitability 
although in the past years we have been successful in gaining regulatory approval for rate increase  there can be no assurance that insurance regulators will grant future rate increases that may be necessary to offset possible future increases in claims cost trends 
also  we remain exposed to possible upward development in previously recorded reserves for claims pursuant to sb as a result of such uncertainties  underwriting losses could occur in the future 
further  we could be required to liquidate investments to pay claims  possibly during unfavorable market conditions  which could lead to the realization of losses on sales of investments 
adverse outcomes to any of the foregoing uncertainties would create some degree of downward pressure on the insurance subsidiaries earnings or cash flows  which in turn could negatively impact our liquidity 
as of december   our insurance subsidiaries had a combined statutory surplus of million compared to million at december  the change in statutory surplus was primarily due to statutory net income of million 
this was partially offset by a decrease in net deferred tax assets of million and an increase in nonadmitted assets of million 
our ratio of net premiums written to statutory surplus improved to at december   compared to at december  on june   the cdi finalized its examination reports on the statutory financial statements for the company s california domiciled insurance subsidiaries for the three year period ended december  the reports did not contain any findings or adjustments 
transactions with related parties 
since  we have entered into several transactions with aig subsidiaries  including various reinsurance agreements  which are discussed under item business 
at december   reinsurance recoverables  net of payables  from aig subsidiaries were million  compared to million at december  other transactions with aig subsidiaries  which are immaterial  have resulted from competitive bidding processes for certain corporate insurance coverages and certain software and data processing services 
in october  as a result of a competitive bidding process  we entered into an agreement with an aig subsidiary to provide investment management services to us  the agreement was approved by the california department of insurance 
contractual obligations and commitments we have various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
certain contractual obligations  such as operating lease obligations  are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  but are required to be disclosed 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments at december  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
in addition  the table reflects the timing of principal payments on outstanding senior notes 
payments due by period amounts in millions total through through remaining years after senior notes capital lease obligation debt operating leases total the table above excludes periodic contributions to pension plans and payments to settle claims  which are discussed below 
the capital lease obligation above resulted from the sale leaseback transaction discussed earlier see further discussion of these items in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have no material purchase obligations or other on or off balance sheet long term liabilities or obligations at december  see discussion about variable interest entities in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our largest insurance subsidiary is responsible for making payments on both the capital lease obligation and most of the operating lease obligations 
the holding company is the obligor on the home office subsidiary leases in woodland hills  california 
we sponsor defined benefit pension plans that may obligate us to make contributions to the plans from time to time 
total contributions to the plans were million in  million in and million in for the past several years we have followed the practice of contributing sufficient amounts to the qualified defined benefit pension plan to meet or exceed statutory funding requirements  without exceeding the maximum amount that would be deductible for corporate income tax purposes  and while maintaining plan assets at a level at least equal to the actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits 
the amount and timing of future contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plan depends on a number of unpredictable factors including statutory funding requirements  the market performance of the plan s assets  cash requirements for benefit payments to retirees  and future changes in interest rates that affect the actuarial measurement of the plan s obligations 
contributions to our non qualified defined benefit pension plan generally are limited to amounts needed to make benefit payments to retirees  which are expected to total approximately million in we had estimated liabilities for losses and lae of million at december   the majority of which will be required to be paid in as the related claims are settled 
we expect operating cash flow to be sufficient to meet our obligations to pay claims and we have readily marketable investments available for sale should operating cash flows prove to be inadequate 
off balance sheet arrangements we currently have no letters of credit  have issued no guarantees on behalf of others other than the guarantee by st century insurance group of the capital lease obligation described above  have no trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value  and have no obligations under any derivative financial instruments

underwriting results the tables presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements summarize the company s unaudited quarterly results of operations for each of the two years in the period ended december  the following discussion of underwriting results by line of business should be read in conjunction with the information presented in those tables and elsewhere herein 
personal auto 
personal automobile insurance is our primary line of business 
vehicles insured outside of california accounted for less than of our direct premiums written in  and our management remains focused on achieving sustainable direct premium written growth and a combined ratio of 
in  we met our profitability goals  posting our best combined ratio since  and our direct premiums written grew despite an increasingly competitive california marketing climate 
direct premiums written grew in  in and in  for a three year compound average growth rate of  or slightly less than our long term goal of 
market conditions in california were somewhat less favorable for growth in than in the preceding two years  for example  some major competitors sought rate decreases in in contrast with the market wide rate increases  which helped to spur consumers shopping activity in and as we proceed with our multi state expansion  we believe that achieving our long term growth goal will steadily depend less on the california marketplace 
california auto retention was for the year ended december   compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in is primarily due to a decline in the growth rate of new customers who typically have a lower retention rate than long time customers 
net premiums earned increased million to  million in  compared to  million in and million in the combined ratio was for the year ended december   compared to and for and  respectively 
net losses and lae incurred increased million to million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the loss and lae ratios were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the effects on the loss and lae ratios of changes in estimates relating to insured events of prior years were as follows favorable in  unfavorable in  and unfavorable in for additional discussion of the factors that led to these changes in estimates  please see item of this report under the heading loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
in general  changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which new information becomes available indicating that a change is warranted  usually in conjunction with our monthly actuarial review 
the ratios of underwriting expenses to net premiums earned were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase from to was primarily due to growth in advertising expenditures and costs associated with increasing the number of new sales agents to handle record volume of new business during the latter half of and all of the increase from to consists primarily of increased advertising costs  additional sales workforce costs  and facility and support costs to improve service and support the texas call center 
several productivity enhancement initiatives are underway aimed at reducing per unit process costs and lowering fixed costs in corporate support areas 
homeowner and earthquake lines in runoff 
we have not written any earthquake policies since and we exited the homeowners insurance business at the beginning of the homeowner and earthquake lines  which are in runoff  experienced adverse development on the remaining loss reserves of million  compared to adverse development of million in and million in of these amounts  million  million  and million  respectively  related to sb earthquake claims 
we caution that the recorded loss and lae estimates for our earthquake lines are subject to a greater than normal degree of uncertainty for a variety of reasons see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have executed various transactions to exit from our homeowner line 
under a january  agreement with balboa insurance company balboa  a subsidiary of countrywide financial corporation countrywide  of homeowner unearned premium reserves and losses on or after that date were ceded to balboa 
under the terms of this agreement  we retain certain loss adjustment expenses 
we began non renewing homeowner policies expiring on february   and thereafter 
substantially all of these customers were offered homeowner coverage through an affiliate of countrywide 
we have completed this process and no longer have any homeowner policies in force 
losses and lae incurred the following table summarizes losses and lae incurred  net of reinsurance  for the periods indicated amounts in thousands years ended december  net losses and lae incurred related to insured events of current year personal auto lines homeowner and earthquake lines in runoff total current year prior years personal auto lines homeowner and earthquake lines in runoff total prior years reserve redundancy deficiency recorded in current year total net favorable reported loss development for the prior accident years was million  which resulted from favorable development on the personal auto lines that was offset by adverse development on the homeowner and earthquake lines in runoff 
the methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated 
any adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in current operating income 
it is management s belief that the unpaid losses and lae are adequate to cover unpaid losses and lae as of december  while we perform quarterly reviews of the adequacy of established unpaid losses and lae  there can be no assurance that our ultimate unpaid losses and lae will not develop redundancies or deficiencies and possibly differ materially from our unpaid losses and lae as of december  in the future  if the unpaid losses and lae develop redundancies or deficiencies  such redundancy or deficiency would have a positive or adverse impact  respectively  on future results of operations 
the process of making changes to unpaid losses and lae begins with the preparation of several point estimates of unpaid losses and lae  a review of the actual claims experience in the quarter  actual rate changes achieved  actual changes in coverage  mix of business  and changes in certain other factors such as weather and recent tort activity that may affect the loss ratio 
our actuaries prepare several point estimates of unpaid losses and lae for each of the coverages  and they use their experience and judgment to arrive at an overall actuarial point estimate of the unpaid losses and lae for that coverage 
meetings are held with appropriate departments to discuss significant issues as a result of the review 
this process culminates in a reserve meeting to review the unpaid losses and lae 
other relevant internal and external factors considered include a qualitative assessment of inflation and other economic conditions  changes in the legal  regulatory  judicial and social environments  underlying policy pricing  exposure and policy forms  claims handling  and geographic distribution shifts 
as a result of the meeting  unpaid losses and lae are finalized and we record quarterly changes in unpaid losses and lae for each of our coverages 
the change in unpaid losses and lae for the quarter for each coverage is the difference between net ultimate losses and lae and the net paid losses and lae recorded through the end of the quarter 
the overall change in our unpaid losses and lae is based on the sum of these coverage level changes 
the point estimate methods include the use of paid loss triangles  incurred loss triangles  claim count triangles  and severity triangles  as well as expected loss ratio methods 
quantitative techniques frequently have to be supplemented by subjective consideration  including managerial judgment  to assure that the overall unpaid losses and lae are adequate to meet projected losses 
for example  in property damage coverages  repair cost trends by geographic region vary significantly 
these factors are periodically reviewed and subsequently adjusted  as appropriate  to reflect emerging trends which are based upon past loss experience 
thus  many factors are implicitly considered in estimating the loss costs recognized 
judgment is required in analyzing the appropriateness of the various methods and factors to avoid overreacting to data anomalies that may distort such prior trends 
for example  changes in limits distributions or development in the most recent accident quarters would require more actuarial judgment 
we do not believe disclosure of specific point estimates calculated by the actuaries would be meaningful 
any one actuarial point estimate is based on a particular series of judgments and assumptions of the actuary 
another actuary may make different assumptions  and therefore reach a different point estimate 
there is a potential for significant variation in developing unpaid losses and lae 
most automobile claims are reported within two to three months whereas the estimate of ultimate severities exhibits greater variability at the same maturity 
generally  actual historical loss development factors are used to project future loss development  and there can be no assurance that future loss development patterns will be the same as in the past 
however  we believe that our reserving methodologies are in line with other personal lines insurers and would normally expect ultimate unpaid losses and lae development to vary by as much as of the carried unpaid losses and lae 
as a result of the significant growth in the non los angeles county regions  the company has experienced changes in the mix of business relative to geography and policy limits 
we believe that the assumption with the highest likelihood of change that could materially affect carried unpaid losses and lae is property damage and collision severity in the san francisco and bay area regions  which have significantly different repair costs and have exhibited significant policy growth 
a change in the severity assumption for these regions would result in an increase or decrease in total unpaid losses and lae of  or million 
while we have settled over of northridge earthquake claims and related litigation  estimates of both the litigation costs and ultimate settlement or judgment amounts related to these claims are subject to a high degree of uncertainty 
please see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional background on the northridge earthquake and sb investment income we utilize a conservative investment philosophy 
no derivatives or nontraditional securities are held in our investment portfolio and only of the portfolio consists of equity securities 
substantially all of the fixed maturity portfolio is investment grade 
net investment income was million in  compared to million in and million in average invested assets increased in  in and in the average annual pre tax yields on invested assets were in  in  and in the average annual after tax yields on invested assets were in  in  and in net realized gains on the sale of investments were million in gross realized gains were million and gross realized losses were million  compared to net realized gains of million in gross realized gains were million and gross realized losses were million  and net realized gains of million in gross realized gains were million and gross realized losses were million 
at december   million of our total fixed maturity investments at fair value were invested in tax exempt bonds  compared to at december  and at december   with the remainder  representing of the portfolio  invested in taxable securities  compared to at december  and at december  the shift to taxable securities in was made to reduce the average duration of the portfolio and to accelerate the realization of the company s nol carryforward 
includes loss on disposal of fixed assets of  and in   and  respectively 
we recognized no other than temporary impairments in   or see discussion under critical accounting estimates 
other income other income of million in the year ended december   included million resulting from a nonrecurring  nonoperational item from the settlement of litigation  interest income of million relating to a favorable settlement with the internal revenue service irs  and miscellaneous items of million 
no other income was reported in and critical accounting estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the financial information contained within those statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and are essential to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
some of our accounting policies require significant judgment to estimate values of either assets or liabilities 
in addition  significant judgment may be needed to apply what often are complex accounting principles to individual transactions to determine the most appropriate treatment 
we have established procedures and processes to facilitate making the judgments necessary to prepare the financial statements 
the following is a summary of the more judgmental and complex accounting estimates and principles 
in each area  we have discussed the assumptions most important in the estimation process 
we have used the best information available to estimate the related items involved 
actual performance that differs from our estimates and future changes in the key assumptions could change future valuations and materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
management has discussed our critical accounting policies and estimates  together with any changes therein  with the audit committee of our board of directors 
losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the estimated liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses lae include the accumulation of estimates of losses for claims reported on or prior to the balance sheet dates  estimates based upon actuarial analysis of historical data of losses for claims incurred but not reported  the development of case reserves to ultimate values and estimates of expenses for investigating  adjusting and settling all incurred claims 
amounts reported are estimates of the ultimate costs of settlement  net of estimated salvage and subrogation 
the estimated liabilities are necessarily subject to the outcome of future events  such as changes in medical and repair costs  as well as economic and social conditions that impact the settlement of claims 
in addition  time can be a critical part of reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence of a loss and the payment or settlement of the claim  the more variable the ultimate settlement amount can be 
accordingly  short tail claims  such as property damage claims  tend to be more reasonably predictable than relatively longer tail liability claims 
for our current mix of auto exposures  which include both property and liability exposures  an average of approximately of the ultimate losses are settled within twelve months of the date of loss 
given the inherent variability in the estimates  management believes the aggregate reserves are adequate  although we continue to caution that the reserve estimates relating to sb are subject to a greater than normal degree of variability and possible future material adjustment as new facts become known 
the methods of making such estimates and establishing the resulting reserves are reviewed and updated monthly and any resulting adjustments are reflected in current operations 
changes in these recorded liabilities flow directly to the income statement on a dollar for dollar basis 
for example  an upward revision of million in the estimated recorded liability for unpaid losses and lae would decrease underwriting profit  and pre tax income  by the same million amount 
conversely  a downward revision of million would increase pre tax income by the same million amount 
property and equipment 
accounting standards require a write off to be recognized when an asset is abandoned or an asset group s carrying value exceeds its fair value 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss  a long lived asset or assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
accounting standards require asset groups to be tested for possible impairment under certain conditions 
in the third quarter of  we recorded a pre tax charge to write off million of previously capitalized software costs for abandoned portions of an advanced personal lines processing system 
as such  in  we assessed the asset group that included the advanced personal lines processing system for impairment 
however  an impairment was not triggered by the abandonment as we determined that the impairment recognition criterion had not been met 
future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group exceeded its carrying amount 
there have been no events or circumstances in that would require a reassessment of the asset group for impairment 
income taxes 
determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any related valuation allowance involves judgment 
generally accepted accounting principles require deferred tax assets and liabilities dtas and dtls  respectively to be recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributed to temporary differences and carryforwards based on provisions of the enacted tax law 
the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated 
temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the financial statements 
for example  we have a dta because the tax bases of our loss and lae reserves are smaller than their book bases 
similarly  we have a dtl because the book basis of our capitalized software exceeds its tax basis 
carryforwards include such items as alternative minimum tax credits  which may be carried forward indefinitely  and net operating losses nols  which can be carried forward years for losses incurred before and years thereafter 
a summary of the significant dtas and dtls relating to the company s temporary differences and carryforwards is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   our dtas total million  and our dtls total million 
the net of those amounts  million  represents the net deferred tax asset reported in the consolidated balance sheet 
we are required to reduce dtas but not dtls by a valuation allowance to the extent that  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not ie  a likelihood of more than that any dtas will not be realized 
recognition of a valuation allowance would decrease reported earnings on a dollar for dollar basis in the year in which any such recognition were to occur 
the determination of whether a valuation allowance is appropriate requires the exercise of management judgment 
in making this judgment  management is required to weigh the positive and negative evidence as to the likelihood that the dtas will be realized 
portions of our nol carryforward are scheduled to expire beginning in  as shown in the table below amounts in millions year of expiration nol excluding st of southwest srly nol of st of southwest consolidated nol totals our core business has generated an underwriting profit for the past three years 
management believes it is reasonable to expect future underwriting profits and to conclude it is at least more likely than not that we will be able to realize the benefits of our dtas 
if necessary  we believe we could implement tax planning strategies  such as investing a higher proportion of our investment portfolio in taxable securities  in order to generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize the nol carryforwards prior to their expiration 
accordingly  no valuation allowance has been recognized as of december  and however  generating future taxable income is dependent on a number of factors  including regulatory and competitive influences that may be beyond our ability to control 
future underwriting losses could possibly jeopardize our ability to utilize our nols 
in the event adverse development or underwriting losses due to either sb matters or other causes were to occur  management might be required to reach a different conclusion about the realization of the dtas and  if so  recognize a valuation allowance at that time 
srly stands for separate return limitation year 
under the federal tax code  only future income generated by st of southwest formerly st of arizona may be utilized against this portion of our nol 
deferred policy acquisition costs 
deferred policy acquisition costs dpac include premium taxes and other variable costs incurred with writing business 
these costs are deferred and amortized over the month policy period in which the related premiums are earned 
management assesses the recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs on a quarterly basis 
the assessment calculates the relationship of actuarially estimated costs incurred to premiums from contracts issued or renewed for the period 
we do not consider anticipated investment income in determining the recoverability of these costs 
based on current indications  no reduction in dpac is required 
the loss and lae ratio used in the recoverability estimate is based primarily on expected ultimate ratios provided by our actuaries 
while management believes that is a reasonable assumption  actual results could differ materially from such estimates 
investments 
temporary unrealized investment gains and losses  net of applicable tax effects  are included as an element of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  which is classified as a separate component of stockholders equity 
for investments with unrealized losses due to market conditions or industry related events  where the company has the positive intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow a market recovery or to maturity  declines in value below cost are not assumed to be other than temporary 
where declines in values of securities below cost or amortized cost are considered to be other than temporary  a charge is required to be reflected in income for the difference between cost or amortized cost and the fair value 
the determination of whether a decline in market value is other than temporary is necessarily a matter of subjective judgment 
no such charges were recorded in  or the timing and amount of realized losses and gains reported in income could vary if conclusions other than those made by management were to determine whether an other than temporary impairment exists 
however  there would be no impact on equity because any unrealized losses are already included in accumulated other comprehensive income

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
in addition to market risk we are exposed to other risks  including the credit risk related to the issuers of our financial instruments  the underlying insurance risk related to our core business and the exposure of the personal lines insurance business  as a regulated industry  to legal  legislative  judicial  political and regulatory action 
financial instruments are not used for trading purposes 
the following disclosure reflects estimated changes in value that may result from selected hypothetical changes in market rates and prices 
actual results may differ 
our cash flow from operations and short term cash position generally are more than sufficient to meet our projected obligations for claim payments  which by the nature of the personal automobile insurance business tend to have an average duration of less than one year 
as a result  it has been unnecessary for us to employ elaborate market risk management techniques involving complicated asset and liability duration matching or hedging strategies 
accordingly  the company primarily invests in fixed maturity investments  which at december   comprised almost of the fair value of the company s total investments 
the remainder of the company s investments  representing approximately of total investments at market value  is held in equity securities 
for all of our fixed maturity investments  we seek to provide for liquidity and diversification while maximizing income without sacrificing investment quality 
the value of the fixed maturity portfolio is subject to interest rate risk where the value of the fixed maturity portfolio decreases as market interest rates increase  and conversely  when market interest rates decrease  the value of the fixed maturity portfolio increases 
duration is a common measure of the sensitivity of a fixed maturity security s value to changes in interest rates 
the higher the duration  the more sensitive a fixed maturity security is to market interest rate fluctuations 
effective duration also measures this sensitivity  but it takes into account call terms  as well as changes in remaining term  coupon rate  and cash flow 
since fixed maturity investments with longer remaining terms to maturity tend to realize higher yields  the company s investment philosophy typically resulted in a portfolio with an effective duration of over years almost years as of december  
due to the current interest rate environment  management  in consultation with the investment committee  targeted a lower duration for the company s fixed maturity investment portfolio to reduce the negative impact of potential increases in interest rates 
as a result  the effective duration of the fixed maturity portfolio declined from approximately years as of december  to years at december  the company has also obtained long term fixed rate financing as a means of increasing the statutory surplus of the company s largest insurance subsidiary 
the following table shows the financial statement carrying values of our fixed maturity investments  which are reported at fair value  and our debt  which is reported at historical value 
the table also presents estimated carrying values at adjusted market rates assuming a basis point increase in market interest rates  given the effective duration noted above  for the fixed maturity investment portfolio and a basis point decrease in market interest rates for the debt determined from a present value calculation
