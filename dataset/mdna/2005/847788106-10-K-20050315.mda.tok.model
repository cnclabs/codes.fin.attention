item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition as of december  should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
general overview we derive revenues principally from the following sale of tickets to motorsports races and other events held at our speedway facilities  licensing of network television  cable television and radio rights to broadcast such events  sale of sponsorships  facility naming rights and promotions to companies that desire to advertise or sell their products or services surrounding our events  commissions earned on sales of food  beverages and hospitality catering and sales of souvenirs and other motorsports related merchandise  and rental of luxury suites during such events and other track facilities 

table of contents we derive additional revenue from the operations of the source international and certain smi properties revenues  racing  the speedway clubs at lms and tms  oil chem  smi trackside  racing country usa and mbm 
see business product revenue and other event related and other operating revenue and note to the consolidated financial statements for descriptions of these businesses 
operating strategy our operating strategy is to increase revenues and profitability through the promotion and production of racing and related events at modern facilities  which serves to enhance customer loyalty  and the marketing and distribution of racing and other sports related souvenir  apparel and other merchandise 
we market our scheduled events throughout the year both regionally and nationally using extensive and innovative marketing activities 
the key components of this strategy  which are further described above in business operating strategy  are as follows commitment to quality and customer satisfaction  innovative marketing and promotional efforts  and utilization of media 
growth strategy we believe our objectives of growing revenues and profitability can be achieved by increasing attendance  broadcasting  sponsorship and other revenues at existing facilities  and by expanding our promotional and marketing expertise to take advantage of opportunities in attractive existing and new markets 
in particular  we are concentrating on further developing long term contracted revenue streams  which are less susceptible to weather and economic conditions 
we intend to continue implementing our growth strategy  which is further described above in business growth strategy  through the following means maximize media exposure and enhance broadcast and sponsorship revenues  expand and improve existing facilities  further develop smi properties  performance racing network  racing legends car and oil chem businesses  increase daily usage of existing facilities  and acquire and develop additional motorsports facilities 
we promote outdoor motorsports events 
weather conditions surrounding these events affect sales of tickets  concessions and souvenirs  among other things 
although we sell a substantial number of tickets well in advance of our larger events  poor weather conditions can have a negative effect on our results of operations 
poor weather can affect current periods as well as successive events in future periods 
significant growth in our revenues will depend  in part  on consistent investment in facilities 
we have several capital projects underway at each of our speedways 
we do not believe our financial performance has been materially affected by inflation 
we have generally been able to mitigate the effects of inflation by increasing prices 
revenues and expenses our revenues and expenses are classified in the following categories because they are important to  and used by  us in assessing our operations 
we classify our revenues as admissions  event related revenue  nascar broadcasting revenue  and other operating revenue 
admissions includes ticket sales for all of our events 
event related revenue includes amounts received from sponsorship fees  luxury suite rentals  souvenir sales  commissions from food and beverage sales  promotional and hospitality revenues  track rentals  naming rights fees  broadcasting rights other than nascar broadcasting revenue  and other event and speedway related revenues 
nascar broadcasting revenue includes rights fees obtained for domestic television broadcasts of nascar sanctioned events held at our speedways 
other operating revenue includes tsi  mbm and certain smi properties merchandising revenues  legends car and parts sales  speedway clubs restaurant  catering and membership income  oil chem revenues  and industrial park rentals 
our revenue items produce different operating margins 
broadcast rights  sponsorships  ticket sales  commissions from food and beverage sales  and luxury suite and track rentals produce higher margins than souvenir sales  as well as sales of tsi  legends cars  oil chem  smi trackside  mbm or other operating revenues 
we classify our expenses to include direct expense of events  nascar purse and sanction fees  and other direct operating expense  among other categories 
direct expense of events principally includes cost of souvenir sales  
table of contents non nascar race purses and sanctioning fees  property and event insurance  compensation of certain employees  advertising  sales and admission taxes  and outside event support services 
nascar purse and sanction fees includes payments to nascar for associated events held at our speedways 
other direct operating expense includes the cost of tsi  mbm and certain smi properties merchandising  legends car  speedway clubs  oil chem and industrial park rental revenues

seasonality and quarterly results in  we plan to hold major annual racing events sanctioned by nascar  including eleven nextel cup and eight busch series racing events 
we also plan to hold two irl racing events  seven nascar craftsman truck series racing events  two iroc racing events  four major nhra racing events  one ccws  and two woo racing events 
our business has been  and is expected to remain  highly seasonal 
we sometimes produce minimal operating income during our third quarter when we host only one major nascar race weekend 
concentration of racing events in any particular future quarter  and the growth in our operations with attendant increases in overhead expenses  may tend to minimize operating income in respective future quarters 
racing schedules may change from time to time which can lessen the comparability of operating results between quarters of successive years and increase or decrease the seasonal nature of our motorsports business 
the major nascar sanctioned races to be held in include the new nextel cup and busch series races at tms 
set forth below is certain comparative summary information with respect to the company s major nascar sanctioned racing events scheduled for and held in and number of major nascar sanctioned events st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter total

we believe nascar may implement rule changes in for the nascar nextel cup series and possibly introduce a new prototype car in that should increase competition on the speedways 
the television ratings for the nascar nextel cup series increased over prior year  with television ratings during the chase for the cup the last ten races of the season that are particularly encouraging 
we believe these rating increases bode well for negotiation of the nascar broadcast contracts  which generally expire after for our upcoming racing season  sponsorship and other event related revenues are showing favorable trends with all of our nascar nextel cup and nascar busch event sponsorships pre sold 
ticket sales for our nascar nextel cup events at ir  lvms and tms are higher than ticket sales at the same time last year 
tickets and luxury suites are essentially sold out for bms s april and august nextel cup events  while ticket sales at ams and lms approximately equal ticket sales at the same time last year 
also  advance ticket and other sales for our new additional nascar nextel cup and busch series racing events at tms  scheduled to be held in november  are trending favorably 
however  at this early date  we are unable to determine whether event results will differ from those previously estimated by management 
the national incidents of september   along with the iraq war and code orange terrorism alerts  have raised a combination of operating factors never before encountered  including public concerns regarding air travel  military actions  and additional national or local catastrophic incidents 
those factors continue to affect consumer and corporate spending sentiment 
while we believe our strong operating cash flow will continue  economic conditions  
table of contents rising fuel prices  and the competitiveness of racing can affect ticket  corporate marketing  sponsorships and other sales 
management believes long term ticket demand  including corporate marketing and promotional spending  should continue to grow 
however  near term ticket sales  particularly to corporate customers  and suite rentals  hospitality and other event revenues may continue to be adversely impacted by these and other factors 
we decided not to increase many ticket and concession prices in to help foster fan support and mitigate any near term demand weakness 
economic conditions could be severely affected by future actual or threats of similar or other national  regional or local incidents  which could materially adversely impact our future operating results 
nascar broadcasting rights agreement 
fiscal is our fifth year under the multi year consolidated domestic television broadcast rights agreement for nascar nextel cup and busch series events 
this agreement is expected to provide us with future increases in contracted broadcasting revenues 
total revenues under this domestic broadcast rights agreement  based on the current race schedule  are contracted for approximately million in this reflects an increase of approximately million or over  and includes the new nextel cup racing event at tms 
while this long term rights agreement will likely result in annual revenue increases over the contract period  associated annual increases in purse and sanction fees paid to nascar may continue 
purse and sanction fees are negotiated with nascar on an annual basis 
accounting for stock based compensation 
as further described below in recently issued accounting standards  sfas no 
r shared based payment was issued in december which requires  among other things  recognizing compensation cost for the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation over the requisite service period and is effective for us as of the beginning of our third quarter we currently apply the disclosure provisions whereby the pro forma effect on net income and earnings per share is presented based on compensation cost for stock options and the employee stock purchase plan determined using the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
we are currently assessing the impact of adopting sfas no 
r on our financial position and results of operations  along with the underlying valuation methods and assumptions 
any compensation cost is not determinable until such time that restricted stock or option grant award amounts  prices and vesting provisions  among other factors  are known 
bank credit facility amendment in as discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and note to the consolidated financial statements  in march  we amended our credit facility to  among other things i increase the separate sub limit for standby letters of credit from million to million  while maintaining the overall revolving credit facility borrowing limit of million  ii extend maturity from may to march  iii increase allowable annual aggregate payments of dividends and repurchases of smi securities from million to million  and up to million  subject to maintaining certain revised financial covenants  iv expand permitted investments of available cash  and v reduce interest which will be based  at our option  upon libor plus to or the greater of bank of america s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 
the separate sub limit for standby letters of credit was increased in anticipation of possible increases in our bulk commodity business as further described in other operating revenue below  and for other business transactions 
other operating revenue 
we intend to develop new merchandising opportunities  expand product offerings through electronic media promotional programming  and market racing and other sports related souvenir merchandise and apparel with corporate customers and other third party venues 
our other operating revenues may increase depending on  among other factors  the success of such efforts  the success of motorsports  particularly nascar s nextel cup series  and future market demand  trends and competition for our non event products and outside venues 
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside our control 
these revenue items may produce lower operating margins than broadcast rights  sponsorships  ticket sales  commissions from food and beverage sales  and luxury suite and track rentals 
while our revenues may increase  there may be associated increases in receivables and inventory levels whose realization is subject to changes in market and economic conditions and other factors that might adversely impact realization 
because of our presence in the petroleum and automotive aftermarket industries  we may  from time to time  expand our business involving the purchase and sale of refined bulk petroleum and related products  and commodity transactions  on a fixed or hedged price basis bulk commodity utilizing cash or letters of credit issued by recognized financial institutions 
we may enter into bulk commodity transactions with petroleum and other companies conducting business in several foreign countries 
as described in bank credit facility amendment in above  we amended our credit facility to  among other things  increase the separate sub limit for standby letters of credit to million in anticipation of possible increases in our bulk commodity and other business transactions 
commodity hedges would be secured by the underlying commodity being hedged 
bulk commodity transactions may occur in the 
table of contents near future which may or may not become significant 
while revenues could become significant  resulting profit margins could be affected by market and other factors such as transaction  unrecoverable and other operating costs  and could be less than those on existing operations 
the accounting for bulk commodity  including underlying hedge  transactions can be affected by many factors  including contract terms  title transfer  settlement timing  underlying hedge terms and other transactional terms or conditions 
revenues and resulting profit margins  if any  could be reported on either a gross or net basis depending on the underlying transactional terms and conditions 
depending on settlement timing and other transactional factors  accounts receivable  inventories  liabilities  and outstanding letters of credit could significantly increase during and between reporting periods 
at this time  management is unable to determine if or when bulk commodity transactions may commence or whether resulting revenues could be material or profitable 
insurance coverage 
heightened concerns and challenges regarding property  casualty  liability  business interruption  and other insurance coverage have resulted from the national incidents on september  and incidents such as the pedestrian bridge collapse at lms in it has become increasingly difficult to obtain high policy limits of coverage at reasonable costs  including coverage for acts of terrorism 
we have a material investment in property and equipment at each of our six speedway facilities that are generally located near highly populated cities and hold motorsports events typically attended by large numbers of fans 
these operational  geographical  and situational factors  among others  have resulted in significant increases in insurance premium costs  and further increases are possible 
while management believes it has reasonable limits of property  casualty  liability  and business interruption insurance in force  including coverage for acts of terrorism  management cannot guarantee that such coverage would be adequate should a catastrophic event occur 
the occurrence of such an incident at any of our speedway facilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future results of operations if asset damage and or its liability were to exceed insurance coverage limits 
the occurrence of additional national incidents  and particularly incidents at sporting events  entertainment or other public venues  may significantly impair our ability to obtain such insurance coverage in the future 
we use a combination of insurance and self insurance to manage various risks associated with our speedway and other properties  and motorsports events and other business risks 
we may increase the marketing of certain products using self insured promotional warranty programs which could subject us to increased risk of loss should the number and amount of claims significantly increase 
also  as described in other operating revenue above  we may increase our bulk commodity business for which we obtain customary insurance with experienced carriers 
we have increased and may further increase our self insurance limits which could subject us to increased risk of loss should the number of incidents  damages  casualties or other claims below such self insured limits increase 
while management believes it has reasonable self insurance limits in place  management cannot guarantee that the number of uninsured losses will not increase 
an increase in the number of uninsured losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future results of operations 
litigation costs 
as discussed in legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements  we are involved in  or have recently settled  various litigation for which significant legal costs were incurred in and we intend to defend vigorously against the claims raised in existing legal actions  and may continue to incur significant legal costs in management is presently unable to quantify the amount of these expected legal costs  and new legal action or changes in pending or threatened legal action against us could result in further increases in legal costs 
significant factors the following are significant factors that affected our financial condition and results of operations in the year ended december  general factors 
we believe our operating results for fiscal were negatively impacted by ongoing public concerns over travel  regional and national economic conditions  rising fuel prices and national security incidents 
we experienced anticipated decreases in attendance at certain of our major racing events with related effects on event related revenue largely stemming from poor weather at those events in however  increases in sponsorship  display  hospitality  camping and other event related revenues over helped to offset these anticipated decreases in admissions revenue and the associated effect on event related merchandising and concession revenues 
reduced consumer and corporate spending impacted the demand for souvenir  apparel and other merchandise at certain non event company and outside venues  with related effects on event related and other operating revenues 
litigation settlement  purchase of north carolina speedway and issuance of add on senior subordinated notes 
as discussed in liquidity and capital resources below and note to the consolidated financial statements  we acquired certain tangible and intangible assets and operations of north carolina speedway for 
table of contents approximately million in cash as part of the ferko shareholder lawsuit settlement 
the acquisition was funded with proceeds from a july million add on offering to the million senior subordinated notes issued in may the terms of the add on notes are identical to those senior subordinated notes issued in may also  applicable law required smi to reimburse the plaintiff for litigation expenses incurred in successfully bringing this suit on smi s behalf 
these and related settlement expenses approximating million paid in cash were reflected as a charge to earnings 
the charge reduced basic and diluted earnings per share for by 
the intangible assets acquired in settlement were principally non amortizable race event sanctioning and renewal agreements with nascar for one annual nextel cup and busch series racing event 
under those sanctioning and renewal agreements  management intends to conduct a second nextel cup and busch series racing event at tms beginning november ncs operations presently consist principally of track rentals 
management s plans or intentions with respect to other future use or operations of ncs have not yet been determined 
at this time  no nascar sanctioned races are scheduled to be held at ncs in or beyond 
management anticipates that the increased add on debt interest payments and working capital requirements for ncs operations  if any  will be largely funded by advance ticket and other event related revenues associated with these new nascar nextel cup and busch series races at tms 
litigation dismissal 
our results for reflect current period recovery of a million pre tax charge to earnings previously recorded in for litigation associated with bms 
in  a lawsuit was filed against smi and bms alleging interference with the use of certain leasehold property rented to the plaintiff  robert l 
larry carrier  by bms  seeking specified compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief 
in  the trial court entered a judgment against smi and bms for approximately million in damages plus costs  and in february  entered an amended judgment awarding the plaintiff approximately million and bms exclusive possession of the leased premises 
a million pre tax charge to earnings was reflected in for the litigation 
we and the plaintiff appealed this judgment  and in  the trial court award against smi and bms was reversed and all plaintiff claims were dismissed 
the million pre tax recovery was reflected in upon successful appeal and court reversal of the decision and dismissal of claims against the company 
declaration of cash dividend 
on october   our board of directors approved an annual cash dividend of per share of common stock aggregating approximately million payable on november  to shareholders of record as of november  the annual cash dividend was paid using available cash and cash investments 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically met our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through a combination of cash flows from operations  bank borrowings and other debt and equity offerings 
we expended significant amounts of cash during for improvements and expansion at our speedway facilities and the acquisition of ncs 
significant changes in our financial condition and liquidity during resulted primarily from net cash generated by operations amounting to million  borrowings under long term debt  principally to finance the ncs business acquisition  amounting to million  cash outlays for capital expenditures amounting to million  cash outlays for the ncs business acquisition amounting to million  and payment of an annual cash dividend amounting to million 
our cash flows from operations in compared to reflect increases in net income as further discussed in results of operations above  recovery of certain other current assets upon resale in  and an increase in deferred income taxes provided primarily for temporary differences pertaining to depreciation of property and equipment 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million and had million in outstanding borrowings under the million revolving credit facility  with availability for borrowing up to an additional million 
at december   net non current deferred tax liabilities totaled million 
while primarily representing the tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax bases of assets and liabilities  the likely future reversal of net deferred income tax liabilities could negatively impact cash flows from operations in the years in which reversal occurs 

table of contents as further discussed in notes   and to the consolidated financial statements  we had the following contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  in thousands payments due by period total current years years thereafter contractual cash obligations current liabilities  excluding current maturities of long term debt and deferred race event income long term debt  including current maturities payable to affiliate other liabilities operating leases total contractual cash obligations commitment expiration by period total current years years thereafter other commercial commitments letters of credit  total other commercial commitments contractual cash obligations above exclude a interest payments under our debt obligations  including the senior subordinated notes and the credit facility in  cash paid for interest  net of amounts capitalized  was approximately million  b income taxes that may be paid in future years in  cash paid for income taxes was approximately million  and c any impact for likely future reversal of net deferred income tax liabilities when reversal occurs 
as scheduled at december   includes required quarterly principal payments under the term loan aggregating million in  million in  million in and million in future liquidity we anticipate that cash from operations and funds available through the credit facility will be sufficient to meet our operating needs at least through  including estimated planned capital expenditures of to million and payment of any future dividends that may be declared 
based upon anticipated future growth and financing requirements  we may  from time to time  engage in additional financing of a character and in amounts to be determined 
we may  from time to time  redeem or retire our debt securities  and purchase our debt and equity securities  depending on liquidity  prevailing market conditions  and such factors as permissibility under the credit facility  as amended in march  and the senior subordinated notes  and as the board of directors  in its sole discretion  may consider relevant 
the credit facility and the senior subordinated notes agreements do not restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer  advance or dividend funds to our parent company  smi  or other subsidiaries 
while we expect to continue to generate positive cash flows from our existing speedway operations  and have generally experienced improvement in our financial condition  liquidity and credit availability  additional liquidity and other resources could be needed to fund our continued growth  including the continued expansion and improvement of our speedways and other facilities 
credit facility 
our credit facility  executed in may  consists of a senior revolving facility the revolving facility and term loan the term loan provided by a syndicate of banks led by bank of america  na as an agent and lender 
the revolving facility provides for borrowings in an aggregate principal amount of up to million  and includes a sub limit of million for borrowings under day swing line loans 
in march  our credit facility was amended to  among other things i increase the separate sub limit for standby letters of credit from million to million  while maintaining the overall revolving credit facility borrowing limit of million  ii extend maturity from may to march  iii increase allowable annual aggregate payments of dividends and repurchases of smi securities from million to million  and up to million  subject to maintaining certain revised financial covenants  iv expand permitted investments of available cash  and v reduce interest based  at the company s option  upon libor plus to or the greater of bank of america s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 
loans made pursuant to the revolving facility may be borrowed  repaid and reborrowed from time to time until the fifth anniversary of the credit facility  subject to certain conditions on the date borrowed 
the term loan  initially in the aggregate principal amount of million  is being amortized by quarterly payments through final maturity in reflecting the march amendment 

table of contents the credit facility contains a number of financial affirmative and negative covenants 
these financial covenants require us to maintain certain ratios of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  funded senior debt to ebitda and earnings before interest and taxes ebit to interest expense  and to maintain a minimum net worth 
negative covenants restrict  among other things  the incurrence and existence of liens  making specified types of investments  restricted payments  dividends  equity and debt security repurchases  capital expenditures  transactions with affiliates  acquisitions  sales of assets  and the incurrence of debt 
indebtedness under the credit facility is guaranteed by all operative company subsidiaries except oil chem the guarantors  and is secured by a pledge of all the capital stock and limited liability company interests  as the case may be  of the guarantors 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the credit facility 
july litigation settlement  purchase of north carolina speedway and issuance of add on senior subordinated notes 
on july   as part of settling the ferko shareholder lawsuit as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we acquired certain tangible and intangible assets and operations of north carolina speedway for approximately million in cash plus acquisition costs 
also  applicable law required smi to reimburse the plaintiff for litigation expenses incurred in successfully bringing this suit on smi s behalf 
these and related settlement expenses approximating million paid in cash were reflected as a charge to earnings 
the intangible assets acquired in settlement were principally non amortizable nascar race event sanctioning and renewal agreements under which we plan to conduct a second annual nextel cup and busch series racing event at tms beginning november ncs operations presently consist principally of track rentals 
management s plans or intentions with respect to other future use or operations of ncs have not yet been determined 
at this time  no nascar sanctioned races are scheduled to be held at ncs in management anticipates that the increased add on debt interest payments and working capital requirements for ncs operations  if any  will be largely funded by advance ticket and other event related revenues associated with these new nascar nextel cup and busch series races at tms 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the acquisition was funded with proceeds from a private placement  on july   of a million add on offering to the million senior subordinated notes due issued in may and approximately million in cash on hand 
the add on notes were issued at par and net proceeds  after commissions and fees  approximated million 
we filed a registration statement in august to exchange these add on notes for a new substantially identical debt securities issue registered under the securities act and completed the exchange offer in october the add on notes are identical to the senior subordinated notes issued in may with the same interest rate  maturity  covenants  limitations and other terms and are governed by the same indenture 
senior subordinated notes 
the senior subordinated notes mature on june  and interest is paid semi annually on june and december on or after june   we may redeem some or all of the senior subordinated notes at any time at annually declining redemption premiums 
on or before june   we may redeem up to of the senior subordinated notes with the proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption premium 
in the event of a change of control  we must offer to repurchase the senior subordinated notes at of par value plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes the senior subordinated notes indenture  among other things  restricts our ability to incur additional debt  pay dividends and make distributions  incur liens  make specified types of investments  apply net proceeds from certain asset sales  engage in transactions with affiliates  merge or consolidate  issue subsidiary dividends or other payments  sell equity interests of subsidiaries  and sell  assign  transfer  lease  convey  or dispose of assets 
the senior subordinated notes indenture permits annual dividend payments of up to approximately per share of common stock  increasable subject to meeting certain financial covenants 
the senior subordinated notes indenture and the credit facility agreement contain cross default provisions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
capital expenditures management believes significant growth in our revenues depends  in part  on consistent investment in facilities 
as such  we expect to continue to make substantial capital improvements in our facilities to meet increasing demand and to increase revenue 
currently  a number of significant capital projects are underway 
projects 
at december   we had various construction projects underway to increase and improve facilities for fan amenities and other site improvements at our speedways 
in  bms began construction of new luxury speedway suites and new permanent dragway seats 
completion of bms s expansion is presently scheduled for similar to prior years  we continue to expand concessions  camping  restrooms and other fan amenities at certain facilities 
in  lvms plans to begin construction of approximately  new permanent grandstand seats for a net increase of approximately  completion of which is presently scheduled for we plan to 
table of contents install or enhance safer crash walls at several of our speedways  resurface lms s superspeedway  and purchase certain land for expansion or development 
we also plan to continue improving and expanding on site roads and available parking  reconfiguring traffic patterns and entrances to ease congestion and improve traffic flow at our speedways 
projects 
in  we completed construction of approximately  new permanent seats at lvms  substantially completed renovating and modernizing lms s infield garages  media center  scoring towers and other facilities  installed safer crash walls at four of our speedways  and completed construction of new administration and marketing facilities at bms 
similar to prior years  we continued to expand concessions  camping  restrooms and other fan amenities for the convenience  comfort and enjoyment of fans at several of our speedways 
we also continued to improve and expand on site roads and available parking  reconfiguring traffic patterns and entrances to ease congestion and improve traffic flow at our speedways 
the estimated aggregate cost of capital expenditures in approximates to million 
numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control  may influence the ultimate costs and timing of various capital improvements at our facilities  including undetected soil or land conditions  additional land acquisition costs  increases in the cost of construction materials and labor  unforeseen changes in design  litigation  accidents or natural disasters affecting the construction site  and national or regional economic changes 
in addition  the actual cost could vary materially from our estimates if our assumptions about the quality of materials or workmanship required or the cost of financing such construction were to change 
construction is also subject to state and local permitting processes  which if changed  could materially affect the ultimate cost and timing of construction 
we also continually evaluate new opportunities that will add value for our stockholders  including the acquisition and construction of new speedway facilities  the expansion and development of our existing legends cars and oil chem products and markets  and the expansion into new and complementary businesses 
dividends any decision concerning the payment of common stock dividends depends upon our results of operations  financial condition and capital expenditure plans  applicable limitations under the credit facility and senior subordinated notes  and other factors the board of directors  in its sole discretion  may consider relevant 
as further described above and in note to the consolidated financial statements  our credit facility was amended in march which  among other things  increased allowable annual aggregate payments of dividends and repurchases of smi securities from million to million  and up to million  subject to maintaining certain revised financial covenants 
the senior subordinated notes indenture permits annual dividend payments of up to approximately per share of common stock  increasable subject to meeting certain financial covenants 
on october   the company s board of directors approved an annual cash dividend of per share of common stock aggregating approximately million payable on november  to shareholders of record as of november  the annual cash dividend was paid using available cash and cash investments 
off balance sheet arrangements as further described in liquidity and capital resources above  we had outstanding letters of credit aggregating million as of december  as further described in near term operating factors above  we amended our credit facility in march which  among other things  increased the separate sub limit for standby letters of credit in anticipation of possible increases in our bulk commodity business and other business transactions 
we presently do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements including off balance sheet obligations  guarantees  commitments  or other contractual cash obligations  other commercial commitments or contingent obligations that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition  revenues  expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies and accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of 
table of contents contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statement date  and reported amounts of revenues and expenses  including amounts that are susceptible to change 
we continually review our accounting policies and accounting estimates  and their application and effect on our financial statements and disclosures  for conformity with gaap  including relevance  accuracy  completeness and non omission of material information 
our critical accounting policies include accounting methods and estimates underlying such financial statement preparation  as well as judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies 
in applying critical accounting policies and making estimates  materially different amounts or results could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and the consolidated financial statements  including the associated notes  appearing elsewhere in this report 
we believe our critical accounting policies  including amounts involving significant estimates  uncertainties and susceptibility to change include the following recoverability of property and equipment and goodwill and other intangible assets 
as of december   we have net property and equipment of million  and net goodwill and other intangible assets of million 
as discussed in recently issued accounting standards below and note to the consolidated financial statements  we adopted sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets under which we assessed initial impairment under transitional rules as of january  we periodically evaluate long lived assets for possible impairment based on expected future undiscounted operating cash flows and profitability attributable to such assets or when indications of possible impairment occur 
the evaluation is subjective and based on conditions  trends and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation 
while we believe no impairment exists at december   different conditions or assumptions  or changes in cash flows or profitability  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of our impairment evaluation and our financial condition or future results of operations 
nascar has announced it would consider potential track realignment of nextel cup series racing events to desirable  potentially more profitable market venues of speedway operators 
while relocation of any nextel cup event among our speedways we now or may own in the future could result in a net increase in our future operating profitability  long lived assets of a speedway from where a nextel cup racing event may move could become impaired resulting in a material impairment charge that adversely affects our financial condition or future results of operations 
depreciable and amortizable lives for property and equipment and intangible assets 
depreciation and amortization is provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets 
we have net property and equipment of million and net amortizable intangible assets of million as of december  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our property and equipment  other intangible assets and estimated useful lives 
as of december   we have nonamortizable intangible assets of million and goodwill of million for race event sanctioning and renewal agreements that are considered to have indefinite useful lives because their renewal and cash flow generation is expected to continue indefinitely 
useful lives are estimated based on outside cost segregation and valuation studies conducted on purchased or constructed speedway property and equipment and purchased intangible assets  historical experience  intended use  condition  available information for comparable assets  and other factors and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation 
we periodically review the estimated useful lives we use to record depreciation and amortization expense  and believe such estimated useful lives are appropriate and no changes are expected at this time 
we also periodically review whether non amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets remains appropriate  and believe such non amortization is appropriate and no changes are expected at this time 
however  because we have a material investment in depreciable property and equipment and intangible assets  changes in depreciable and amortizable lives  should they occur  could have a significant impact on our financial condition or future results of operations 
revenue recognition for our racing events 
we recognize admissions  nascar broadcasting and other event related revenues when an event is held 
advance revenues and certain related direct expenses pertaining to specific events are deferred until the event is held 
deferred expenses primarily include race purses and sanctioning fees remitted to nascar or other sanctioning bodies and sales and admission taxes and credit card processing fees on advance revenues 
deferred race event income relates to scheduled events to be held in upcoming periods 
if circumstances prevent a race from being held during the racing season i generally advance revenue is refundable and ii all deferred direct event expenses would be immediately recognized except for race purses and sanction fees which would be refundable from nascar or other sanctioning bodies  and for sales and admission taxes which would be refundable from taxing authorities 
we believe this accounting policy results in appropriate recognition and matching of revenues and expenses associated with our racing events and helps ensure comparability and consistency between our financial statements 
we believe our revenue recognition polices follow the guidance issued in sab no 
revenue recognition in financial statements 

table of contents realization of receivables and inventories 
we assess realization of accounts and notes receivable and inventories  including any need for allowances for doubtful accounts or inventories 
we consider such factors  among other things  as customer creditworthiness  historical collection and sales experience for receivables  and current inventory levels  current and future market demand  and trends and conditions for inventories 
the assessment is subjective and based on conditions  trends and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation  which are subject to changes in market and economic conditions  including changes or deterioration in customer financial condition or merchandising distribution and other factors  that might adversely impact realization 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future income tax effect of temporary differences between financial and income tax bases of assets and liabilities assuming they will be realized and settled at amounts reported in the financial statements 
our accounting for income taxes reflects our assessment of future tax liabilities based on assumptions and estimates for timing  likelihood of realization  and tax laws existing at the time of evaluation 
at december   net deferred tax liabilities totaled million  after reduction for net deferred tax assets of million 
these net deferred tax liabilities will likely reverse in future years and could negatively impact cash flows from operations in the years in which reversal occurs 
a valuation allowance of million was provided against deferred tax assets as of december  management has assessed the deferred tax assets  after reduction for the valuation allowance  and believes realization is more likely than not 
however  changes in tax laws  assumptions or estimates used in the accounting for income taxes  or changes or adjustments resulting from review by taxing authorities  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on amounts or timing of realization or settlement 
such effects could result in a material acceleration of income taxes currently payable or valuation charges for realization uncertainties  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or future results of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on income taxes 
legal proceedings and contingencies 
as discussed above in legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements  we are involved in various legal matters and intend to continue to defend ourselves in existing legal actions in fiscal we use a combination of insurance and self insurance to manage various risks associated with our speedways  other properties and motorsports events  as discussed above in near term operating factors insurance coverage  and other business risks 
we accrue a liability for contingencies if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable 
the likelihood of an adverse outcome and estimation of amounts are assessed using legal counsel on litigation matters  outside insurance administrators and consultants for insured and self insured claims  along with historical trends  assumptions and other information available at the time of assessment 
we believe amounts requiring accrual are properly reflected in the accompanying financial statements 
we do not believe the outcome of the lawsuits  incidents or other legal or business risk matters  will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations 
however  new or changes in pending or threatened legal action or claims against us  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of these matters and our financial condition or future results of operations 
accounting for stock based compensation 
as of december   we continued to account for stock based employee compensation using accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees which recognizes compensation cost based on the intrinsic value of equity instruments awarded as permitted under sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
as all stock options granted under our stock option plans have exercise prices equal to the market value of the underlying common stock at grant date  no compensation cost has been reflected in net income for these plans 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we currently disclose the pro forma effect on net income and earnings per share based on compensation cost for stock options and the employee stock purchase plan determined using fair value 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  smi s stock option plan expired by its terms on december  in february  the smi board of directors adopted a new stock incentive plan the plan which was approved by our stockholders at the annual meeting of stockholders 
awards under the plan may be in the form of incentive stock options  non statutory stock options or restricted stock 
approval of the plan did not amend or modify the plan 
while smi can no longer grant stock options under the plan  plan termination did not adversely affect rights under any outstanding stock options previously granted under the plan 
under the plan  as currently approved by the board of directors   shares of smi s common stock are reserved for issuance subject to various restrictions and adjustments including no more than  shares of restricted stock awards may be granted  no individual may be granted options aggregating more than  shares of common stock during any calendar year  and for restricted stock awards designated as performance awards  no individual may be granted an aggregate of more than  shares of common stock during any calendar year 

table of contents as further described below in recently issued accounting standards  sfas no 
r shared based payment was issued in december which i generally requires recognizing compensation cost for the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation over the requisite service period  ii applies to all awards granted  modified  vesting  repurchased or cancelled after the required effective date  and iii is effective for us as of the beginning of our third quarter we are currently assessing the impact of adopting sfas no 
r on our financial position and results of operations  along with the underlying valuation methods and assumptions 
the effect of this new accounting standard  depending on numerous factors including  among others  market conditions and prices for our common stock  the number and vesting periods of options granted  exercised or cancelled  or the sensitivity and fluctuation in assumptions used in valuation methods  could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations 
any compensation cost is not determinable until such time that restricted stock or option grant award amounts  prices and vesting provisions  among other factors  are known 
segment disclosures 
we periodically evaluate the possible effects of sfas no 
disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information on our financial statement disclosures 
our motorsports related operations comprise one operating segment and encompass all admissions  event related  nascar broadcasting  and other motorsports related souvenir merchandising operating revenues and associated expenses 
our motorsports related operations encompass similar types and classes of customers and similar methods for providing or distributing motorsports related services  souvenirs and other merchandise 
other company operations are comprised of non motorsports and non event related merchandising activities that presently are not significant relative to those of our motorsports related operations 
as such  we believe we have only one reportable segment 
at this time  sfas no 
continues to have no effect on our financial statement disclosures 
recently issued accounting standards in january  financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities was issued which  among other things  provides guidance on identifying variable interest entities vie and determining when assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests  and operating results of a vie should be included in a company s consolidated financial statements  and also requires additional disclosures by primary beneficiaries and other significant variable interest holders 
in december  the fasb issued a revision of fin fin r to clarify certain provisions and exempt certain entities from its requirements 
we presently do not hold an interest in a variable interest entity  therefore  application of fin and fin r has not affected our financial statements or disclosures 
in november  sfas no 
inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter was issued as a result of the fasb s broader efforts to promote convergence of international accounting standards and  among other things  clarifies abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials  and requires allocation of fixed production overhead to inventory based on normal capacity of production facilities 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred in fiscal years beginning after june  at this time  adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to significantly impact our financial statements or future results of operations 
in december  sfas no

was issued which  among other things  eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
sfas no 
is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal years beginning after june  at this time  adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to significantly impact our financial statements or future results of operations

table of contents environmental matters lms s property includes areas that were used as solid waste landfills for many years 
landfilling of general categories of municipal solid waste on the lms property ceased in there is one lcid landfill currently being permitted to receive inert debris and waste from land clearing activities  and one lcid landfill that was closed in two other lcid landfills on the lms property were closed in lms intends to allow similar lcid landfills to be operated on the lms property in the future 
prior to  lms leased certain property to allied for use as c d landfill  which received solid waste resulting solely from construction  remodeling  repair or demolition operations on pavement  buildings or other structures  but could not receive inert debris  land clearing debris or yard debris 
the lms c d landfill is now closed 
in addition  allied owns and operates an active solid waste landfill adjacent to lms 
we believe the active solid waste landfill was constructed in such a manner as to minimize the risk of contamination to surrounding property 
we also believe our operations  including the landfills and facilities on our property  are in substantial compliance with all applicable federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
we are not aware of any situations related to landfill operations which we expect would materially adversely affect our financial position or future results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our financial instruments with interest rate risk exposure consist only of notes receivable  bank revolving credit facility borrowings and the term loan under the credit facility  and two interest rate swap agreements that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
a change in interest rates of one percent on floating notes receivable and debt balances outstanding at december   excluding the interest rate swaps  would cause an approximate change in annual interest income of  and annual interest expense of  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we use interest rate swap agreements at times for non trading purposes to hedge interest rate risk and optimize a combination of variable and fixed interest rate debt 
we presently have two interest rate swap transactions that are separately designated as cash flow and fair value hedges of underlying fixed and variable rate debt obligations 
the swaps have notional amounts  interest payments and maturity dates that match the underlying debt and meet the conditions for assuming no ineffectiveness using the short cut method 
the swaps have principal notional amounts of million  provide for settlement every six months on june and december  and expire corresponding with the underlying hedged debt terms 
at december  and  the aggregate net estimated fair market value liability of these hedges is  and 
fair value estimates are based on relevant market information at a specific point in time  and changes in assumptions or market conditions could significantly affect estimates
