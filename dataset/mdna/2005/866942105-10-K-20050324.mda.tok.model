new accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
arb 
fin provides guidance in determining whether consolidation is required under the controlling financial interest model of arb or whether the variable interest model under fin should be used to account for existing and new entities 
in december  the fasb released a revised version of fin fin r clarifying certain aspects of fin and providing certain entities with exemptions from its requirements 
the company uses the equity method of accounting to account for investments in its joint venture in china in which it does not have a majority ownership or exercise control 
the company adopted fin as of september   and does not believe that its investment in the china joint venture is a variable interest entity within the scope of fin r  nor is it material to the financial statements of the company at december  in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter the amendments made by sfas clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
while sfas enhances accounting research bulletin no 
 restatement and revision of accounting research bulletins  and clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage  the statement also removes inconsistencies between arb and international accounting standards no 
and amends arb to clarify that abnormal amounts of costs should be recognized as period costs 
under some circumstances  according to arb  the above listed costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges 
sfas requires these items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal and requires allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion 
this standard will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the impact of the adoption of sfas on the company s reported operating results  financial position and existing financial statement disclosure is not expected to be material

 statement of cash flows 
this statement requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions 
this statement eliminates the alternative to use apb s intrinsic value method of accounting that was provided in sfas as originally issued 
under apb  issuing stock options to employees generally resulted in recognition of no compensation cost 
sfas r also requires that the company estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest and to revise the estimate as the actual forfeitures differ from the estimate 
this standard is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  the effect of these items and other changes in sfas r as well as the potential impact on the company s reported operating results  financial position and existing financial statement disclosure is currently being evaluated 
sfas r requires that the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow  thus  reducing net operating cash flows and increasing net financing cash flows in the periods after the effective date 
the company cannot estimate what these amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options

rather  the impact of this deduction will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on the company s income tax return 
the repeal of eti and its replacement with a dpa deduction were not in effect in and  therefore  did not have an effect on the income tax provision for the year ended december  the company does not expect the net effect of the phase out of the eti deduction and phase in of the new dpa deduction to result in a material impact on its effective income tax rate in in fsp  the fasb acknowledged that  due to the proximity of the act s enactment date to many companies year ends and the fact that numerous provisions within the act are complex and pending further regulatory guidance  many companies might not be in a position to assess the impacts of the act on their plans for repatriation or reinvestment of foreign earnings 
therefore  the fsp provided companies with a practical exception to the permanent reinvestment standards of sfas and apb no
