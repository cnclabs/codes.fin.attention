critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report describe the company s significant accounting polices used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the company continually evaluates its critical accounting policies and estimates 
the company believes the critical accounting polices listed below reflect significant judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount estimated to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from extending credit to the company s customers 
in judging the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  the company considers multiple factors  including historical bad debt experience  the general economic environment  the need for specific client reserves and the aging of the company s receivables 
this provision is included in operating expenses as a general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing these factors 
if the factors utilized in determining the allowance do not reflect future performance  then a change in the allowance for doubtful accounts would be necessary in the period such determination has been made which would impact future results of operations 
as of december   the allowance for doubtful accounts was  for gross accounts receivable of million 
deferred taxes significant judgment is required in determining the realizability of the company s deferred tax assets 
the company must assess the likelihood that its net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent the company believes that recovery is not likely  it must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent the company establishes a valuation allowance  it must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
as of december   the consolidated balance sheet included net deferred tax assets of million 
the company s methodology for determining the realizability of its deferred tax assets involves estimates of future taxable income from its core business  the estimated impact of future tax deductions from the exercise of stock options outstanding as of december   and the expiration dates and amounts of net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credits 
these estimates are projected through the life of the related deferred tax assets based on assumptions which management believes to be reasonable and consistent with current operating results 
although the company had cumulative pre tax income for financial reporting purposes for the three years ended december   the company did not pay any significant income taxes over that period due to tax deductions from the exercise of stock options as well as its utilization of net operating losses 
in assessing the realizability of its deferred tax assets as of december   the company considered evidence regarding its ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize its deferred tax assets 
the primary evidence considered included the cumulative pre tax income for financial reporting purposes for the past three years  the cumulative tax operating loss for the past three years  the estimated impact of future tax deductions from the exercise of stock options outstanding as of december   and the estimated future taxable income based on historical operating results 
after giving consideration to these factors  the company concluded that it was more likely than not that tax loss carryforwards that expire in and other tax credits that expire within the next four years will not be utilized due to the estimated future tax deductions from the exercise of stock options outstanding as of december  as a result  the company recorded a valuation allowance of  for the year ended december  the company also recorded a full valuation allowance of  relating to foreign net operating losses that are subject to uncertainty regarding utilization 
the company also concluded that it was more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets of million as of december  and the estimated future tax deductions from the exercise of stock options outstanding as of december  would be utilized prior to expiring 
based on this conclusion  the company would require approximately million in cumulative future taxable income to be generated at various times over the next twenty years to realize the related net deferred tax assets of million as of december  as well as the estimated future tax deductions from the exercise of stock options outstanding and in the money as of december  in the event that the company adjusts its estimates of future taxable income or tax deductions from the exercise of stock options  or the company s stock price increases significantly without a corresponding increase in taxable income  the company may need to establish additional valuation allowances  which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations 
long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the market value of the business or asset acquired  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the business or asset acquired is used  or a significant adverse change in the business climate 
if such events or changes in circumstances are present  the undiscounted cash flows method is used to determine whether the asset is impaired 
cash flows would include the estimated terminal value of the asset and exclude any interest charges 
to the extent the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated remaining life of the asset  the impairment is measured using the discounted cash flows 
the discount rate utilized would be based on management s best estimate of the related risks and return at the time the impairment assessment is made 
the company s long lived assets consist of property and equipment of million  licensed technology of  and other intangible assets subject to amortization of million as of december  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives the company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized to expense and must be reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the company operates as one reporting unit and therefore compares the book value to the market value market capitalization plus a control premium 
if the market value exceeds the book value  goodwill is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is not necessary 
if the company s book value exceeds the market value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of the goodwill with the book value of the goodwill 
if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
any loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
after a goodwill impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill is its new accounting basis 
subsequent reversal of a previously recognized goodwill impairment loss is prohibited once the measurement of that loss is completed 
the company completed the annual goodwill impairment assessment as of december   upon which no impairment was recorded 
the company s goodwill was million as of december  commitments and contingencies as of december   the company had a commitment with r technology  inc r to purchase an estimated million of product for resale over the next quarters

any changes to these estimates could have an adverse impact on the company s financial position and results of operations

the company follows specific and detailed guidelines in determining the proper amount of revenue to be recorded  however  certain judgments affect the application of the company s revenue recognition policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause the company s operating results to vary significantly from period to period 
the significant judgments for revenue recognition typically involve whether collectibility can be considered probable and whether fees are fixed or determinable 
in addition  the company s transactions often consist of multiple element arrangements  which must be analyzed to determine the relative fair value of each element  the amount of revenue to be recognized upon shipment  if any  and the period and conditions under which deferred revenue should be recognized 
the company licenses its software and sells products and services to end users and also indirectly through original equipment manufacturers oems and independent distributors collectively resellers 
terms offered by the company do not generally differ based on whether the customer is an end user  or a reseller 
the company offers terms that require payment within to days after product delivery 
the company does not offer rights of return  acceptance clauses or price protection to its customers 
license fees revenue is derived from the licensing of computer software 
hardware revenue is derived from the sale of system hardware  including peripheral equipment 
maintenance and service revenue is derived from software maintenance and from telephone support  installation  training and engineering services 
the company s software licenses are always sold as part of an arrangement that includes maintenance and support and often installation and training services 
engineering services consist of software modification or development services that are sold separately to oems 
the company generally sells hardware as part of a system sale  but it occasionally sells hardware as part of a system upgrade or additional product sale 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the aicpa and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
the company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when it has persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been shipped or the services have been provided to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is probable 
provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met  license revenue from resellers is recognized on a sell in or sell through basis depending on the arrangement with the reseller 
the company recognizes revenue from resellers on a sell in basis provided the reseller i assumes all risk of the purchase  ii has the ability and obligation to pay regardless of receiving payment from the end user  and iii has a history of timely payments 
the company evaluates the credit worthiness of all customers 
in circumstances where the company does not have experience selling to a customer and lacks adequate credit information to conclude that collection is probable  revenue is deferred until the arrangement fees are collected and all other revenue recognition criteria in the arrangement have been met 
in addition to the aforementioned general policy  the following are the specific revenue recognition policies for services and multiple element arrangements 
software and hardware revenue from license fees and hardware is recognized when shipment of the product has occurred  no significant company obligations with regard to implementation remain and the company s services are not considered essential to the functionality of other elements of the arrangement 
see also multiple element arrangements below for further information 
services revenue from maintenance and support arrangements is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance and support arrangements 
revenue from training and installation services is recognized as the services are provided to customers 
revenue from engineering services  where the company is performing significant customization or modification of software  is recognized using contract accounting on a percentage of completion basis 
the company records revenue by reference to actual hours incurred to date and the estimated hours remaining to complete the services 
multiple element arrangements the company enters into arrangements with customers that include a combination of software products  system hardware  specified upgrades  maintenance and support  or installation and training services 
for such arrangements  the company recognizes revenue using the residual value method 
the company allocates the total arrangement fee among the various elements of the arrangement based on the relative fair value of each of the undelivered elements determined by vendor specific objective evidence 
the fair value of maintenance and support services is based upon the renewal rate for continued service arrangements 
the fair value of installation and training services is established based upon separate pricing for the services 
in software arrangements for which the company does not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for all elements  revenue is deferred until the earlier of when vendor specific objective evidence is determined for the undelivered elements residual method or when all elements for which the company does not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  have been delivered

during  the company concluded that it is more likely than not that substantially all of its net deferred tax assets would be realized  and the company reversed substantially all of its valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets  which resulted in the recording of a net tax benefit in the reversal of the deferred tax assets valuation allowance is based upon the company s historical operating performance and management s expectation that the company will generate taxable income of at least million in future periods to allow it to realize its deferred tax assets resulting from the tax benefits associated with its net operating loss carryforwards and a significant portion of its research and development tax credit carryforwards  as well as certain other tax benefits related to book and tax income timing differences 
the reversal of the valuation allowance resulted in a tax benefit of million 
this reversal net of other current year state and federal income taxes resulted in a net tax benefit of million in the company s effective income tax rate is volatile based on the level of operating income achieved  the level of research and development credits available to the company  the mix between our us operating results  for which we record income taxes  and our foreign operating results  for which we do not record an income tax benefit due to the uncertainty of realizing these tax benefits in future years in our foreign jurisdictions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices  interest rates  indices  volatilities  correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes  and it does not enter into forward financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency rates because  as disclosed above  substantially all of the company s foreign transactions are negotiated  invoiced and paid in us dollars 
based on the controls in place and the relative size of the financial instruments entered into  the company believes the risks associated with not using these instruments would not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in addition  the company does not engage in speculative transactions and does not use derivative instruments or engage in hedging activities 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s accounting policies and other information related to these financial instruments 
in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to market risks  including changes in interest rates and price changes that could affect the company s operating results 
as of december   fluctuations in interest rates  exchange rates and price changes would not have had a material effect on the company s financial position or operating results 
interest rate risk the company places its cash and cash equivalents  which generally have a term of less than days  with a high quality financial institution and has investment guidelines relative to diversification and maturities designed to maintain safety and liquidity 
as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
due to the short term nature of these instruments  the carrying value approximates market value 
if  during  average short term interest rates decreased by from average rates  the company s projected interest income from short term investments would decrease by approximately  assuming a similar level of investments in price risk as of december   the company held marketable securities with an aggregate fair market value of million 
all of the company s marketable securities are classified as available for sale and all mature in one year or less 
available for sale investments are recorded at market value  which is based on quoted market prices  with unrealized holding gains and losses included as a separate component of stockholders equity 
the company uses a specific identification cost method to determine the gross realized gains and losses on the sale of its securities 
had market prices of such securities declined as of december   the values of these instruments would have decreased by approximately million 
foreign currency risk substantially all of the company s foreign transactions are negotiated  invoiced and paid in us dollars 
therefore  fluctuations in the value of the dollar as compared to other foreign currencies have not had an effect on the company
