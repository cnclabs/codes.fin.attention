item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by  our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
certain statements in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are forward looking statements 
see special note regarding forward looking statements below 
overview we are a leading temporary healthcare staffing company and the largest nationwide provider of travel nurse staffing services 
we recruit nurses and allied health professionals  our temporary healthcare professionals  nationally and internationally and place them on temporary assignments of variable lengths at acute care hospitals and healthcare facilities throughout the united states 
for the year ended december   we recorded revenue of million  as compared to revenue of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the number of temporary healthcare professionals on assignment averaged   and  in  and  respectively 
we recorded net income of million for the year ended december   as compared to net income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
beginning in we experienced a decline in demand for our services  which led to a reduction in temporary healthcare professionals on assignment  revenue and net income 
see additional discussion in recent trends and results of operations below 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from fees paid directly by hospitals and healthcare facilities rather than from payments by government or other third parties 
we enter into two types of contracts with our hospital and healthcare facility clients payroll contracts and flat rate contracts 
under a payroll contract  the temporary healthcare professional is our employee 
we then bill our hospital or healthcare facility client at an hourly rate to compensate us for the temporary healthcare professional s wages and benefits  as well as for recruitment  housing and travel services 
our clients generally prefer payroll contracts because this arrangement eliminates significant employee and payroll administrative burdens for them 
alternatively  under a flat rate contract  the temporary healthcare professional becomes an employee of the hospital or healthcare facility and is placed on their payroll 
we bill the hospital or healthcare facility a flat weekly rate to compensate us for providing recruitment  housing and travel services 
temporary healthcare professional wages and benefits billed under a payroll contract effectively represent a pass through cost component for us and we are compensated by our clients for our value added services 
while payroll contracts generate more gross profit than flat rate contracts  the gross margin generated is lower due to the pass through of the temporary healthcare professional s compensation costs 
during  approximately of our contracts with our hospital and healthcare facility clients were payroll contracts 
since we have completed five strategic acquisitions 
we acquired medical express  inc in november  which strengthened our presence in the pacific northwest and mountain states 
during  we completed the acquisitions of nursesrx  inc in june and preferred healthcare staffing  inc in november  which strengthened our presence in the eastern and southern regions of the united states 
we completed our acquisition of ogp in may  the leading recruiter of registered nurses from english speaking foreign countries for placement in the united states 
we completed our fifth acquisition in april  acquiring hrmc  to add to our presence in the eastern and southern regions of the united states 
each of these acquisitions has been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting 
therefore  the operating results of the acquired entities are included in our results of operations commencing on the date of acquisition of each entity 
as a result  our results of operations following each acquisition may not be comparable with our prior results 
at the completion of our initial public offering in november  options to purchase  shares of our common stock that we previously granted to members of our management immediately vested 
these options 
table of contents had an average exercise price of  which was below the initial public offering price of per share 
as a result  we recorded approximately million of non cash stock based compensation expense in the fourth quarter of  of which million was related to these options 
in addition  we also recorded million of non cash stock based compensation expense in the first three quarters of and million for upon the completion of our initial public offering  we utilized a portion of the proceeds to retire all of our existing indebtedness approximately million 
the retirement of debt resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately million in  which was related to the write off of the unamortized discount on our senior subordinated notes and unamortized deferred financing costs and loan fees 
on october   we completed a tender offer for an aggregate of million  or approximately million shares of our common stock and certain employee stock options 
in connection with the tender offer  we amended our credit facility 
the amended credit facility provides for  among other things  a million secured revolving credit facility  letter of credit sub facility and swing line loan sub facility and a new million secured term loan facility maturing in october our amended and restated credit agreement stipulates a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  a maximum leverage ratio and other customary covenants 
recent trends from through  the temporary healthcare staffing industry grew at a compound annual growth rate of  and this growth accelerated to a compound annual growth rate of approximately from to during  the demand for temporary healthcare professionals declined due to a number of factors 
in particular  we believe hospitals increased their nurse recruitment efforts  stretched the productivity of permanent staff and maximized cost control efforts to eliminate or reduce outsourced staffing solutions 
in addition  influenced by economic conditions during  we believe permanent staff at our hospital and healthcare facility clients were more likely to work overtime and less likely to leave their positions  creating fewer vacancies and fewer opportunities for us to recruit and place our temporary healthcare professionals 
demand for our services stabilized from april through late  and increased each quarter in we believe that this improvement in demand has been caused by a number of factors  including an increase in hospital admissions  legislation impacting healthcare staffing such as the california nurse to patient staffing ratios that went into effect in january  signs of an improving economy and our increased focus on our hospital and healthcare facility clients 
while this rise in demand is positive and creates opportunities for growth  increases in the supply of new temporary healthcare professional candidates has not grown at the same pace as demand 
we primarily draw our supply of temporary healthcare professionals from national recruitment efforts through our targeted multi brand recruitment strategy 
we believe that sustained growth in hospital and healthcare facility orders will generate increasing interest and new recruiting opportunities in travel nursing 
recently  international supply channels have represented a small but growing supply source  however  our ability to recruit healthcare professionals through these foreign supply channels may be impacted by government legislation limiting the number of permanent immigrant visas that can be issued and the processing times associated with these visas 
the number of temporary healthcare professionals on assignment with us decreased from an average of  in to an average of  in primarily as a result of this decline  our revenue and net income also decreased 
however  demand for our services has grown during each quarter of we are uncertain whether these increases in demand for our services will generate consistent future growth in the average number of our temporary healthcare professionals on assignment 
critical accounting principles and estimates we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our financial 
table of contents statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to asset impairment  accruals for self insurance and compensation and related benefits  allowance for doubtful accounts and contingencies and litigation 
these estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements goodwill we have recorded goodwill resulting from our past acquisitions 
commencing with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january   we ceased amortizing goodwill and have performed annual impairment analyses to assess the recoverability of the goodwill  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
upon our annual impairment analyses on december  and december   we determined that there was no impairment of goodwill 
if we are required to record an impairment charge in the future  it could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
as of december  and december   we had million and million  respectively  of goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
self insured health insurance claims reserve we maintain an accrual for incurred  but not reported  claims arising from self insured health benefits we provide to our temporary healthcare professionals  which is included in accrued compensation and benefits in our consolidated balance sheets 
we determine the adequacy of this accrual by evaluating our historical experience and trends related to both health insurance claims and payments  information provided to us by our insurance broker and third party administrator and industry experience and trends 
if such information indicates that our accruals are overstated or understated  we reduce or provide for additional accruals 
our accrual at december  was based on i a monthly average of our actual historical health insurance claim amounts and ii the average period of time from the date the claim is incurred to the date that it is reported to us and paid 
we believe this is the best estimate of the amount of incurred  but not reported  self insured health benefit claims at year end 
as of december  and december   we had million and million  respectively  accrued for incurred  but not reported  health insurance claims 
the decline in the accrual was primarily related to a favorable trend in insurance claims paid over the past year 
historically  our accrual for health insurance has been adequate to provide for incurred claims  and has fluctuated with increases or decreases in the average number of temporary healthcare professionals on assignment  changes in our claims experience and changes in the reporting and processing time for claims 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated credit losses resulting from collection risks  including the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this results in a provision for bad debt expense 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reported as a reduction of accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by evaluating the credit risk for individual customer receivables  considering the financial condition of each customer and historical payment trends  delinquency trends  credit histories of customers and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of 
table of contents their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be provided 
as of december  and december   our allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million  respectively 
the reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts was primarily related to million of write offs of fully reserved receivables in the prior year  favorable trends in our customer collections experience and overall reductions in accounts receivable balances 
professional liability reserve we maintain an accrual for professional liability self insured retention limits  net of our insurance recoverable  which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets 
we determine the adequacy of this accrual by evaluating our historical experience and trends  loss reserves established by our insurance carriers and third party administrators  as well as through the use of independent actuarial studies 
we obtain updated actuarial studies on a semi annual basis that use actual claims data to determine the appropriate reserves for incurred  but not reported  professional liability claims for each year 
due to our varied historical claims loss experience  our actuary provides us with a range of incurred  but not reported  claim reserves 
the range for the total professional liability reserve at december   which incorporated the range for incurred  but not reported  claims provided by our actuaries  was between million and million 
as of december  and december   we had million and million  respectively  accrued for professional liability retention 
because of our varied loss history  there is no amount within the range that management or the actuaries believe is a better estimate than any other amount 
as such  we accrued the low end of the range at december  and december  the increase in the professional liability accrual was related to expected claims incurred  but not reported  during the year ended december  based on recent unfavorable development of reported claims and the unfavorable impact on incurred  but not reported  claims  offset by an immaterial amount of payments made during the period 
workers compensation reserve we maintain an accrual for workers compensation self insured retention limits  which is included in accrued compensation and benefits in our consolidated balance sheets 
we determine the adequacy of these accruals by evaluating our historical experience and trends  loss reserves established by our insurance carriers and third party administrators  as well as through the use of independent actuarial studies 
we obtain updated actuarial studies on a semi annual basis that use actual claims data to determine the appropriate reserve both for reported claims and incurred  but not reported  claims for each policy year 
the actuarial study for workers compensation provides us with the estimated losses for prior policy years and an estimated percentage of payroll compensation to be accrued for the current year 
we record our accruals based on the amounts provided in the actuarial study  and we believe this is the best estimate of our liability for reported claims and incurred  but not reported  claims 
as of december  and december   we had million and million  respectively  accrued for workers compensation claims 
claim payments made against the reserve in for the current and prior years lagged behind the increase in the reserve  as reserves remain outstanding for workers compensation claims incurred during the course of the last four years 
in addition  during the year ended december   we reduced the accrual for workers compensation for prior policy years by million based on the most recent independent actuarial study we received 
there has not been any material change in workers compensation rates 
contingent liabilities we are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 
some of these matters include payroll and employee related matters and investigations by governmental agencies regarding our employment practices 
as we become aware of such claims and legal actions  we provide 
table of contents accruals if the exposures are probable and estimable 
if an adverse outcome of such claims and legal actions is reasonably possible  we assess materiality and provide disclosure  as appropriate 
we may also become subject to claims  governmental inquiries and investigations and legal actions relating to services provided by our temporary healthcare professionals  and we maintain accruals for these matters if the amounts are probable and estimable 
we are currently not aware of any such pending or threatened litigation that would be considered reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain statements of operations data as a percentage of revenue

revenue decreased  from million for to million for this decrease is comparable to the decrease in the number of temporary healthcare professionals on assignment  which decreased from an average of  for to an average of  for of the million decrease  million was attributable to the decline in the average number of temporary healthcare professionals on assignment and million was attributable to a shift in the mix from payroll to flat rate contracts 
these decreases were partially offset by improvements in contract terms  which included increases in bill rates charged to hospital and healthcare facility clients  of approximately million  and the additional day in due to being a leap year  which contributed million 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue decreased  from million for to million for of the million decrease  approximately million was attributable to the decline in the average number of temporary healthcare professionals on assignment  partially offset by an increase of approximately million attributable to net increases in compensation provided to our temporary healthcare professionals and by an increase of approximately million attributable to the extra day in gross profit 
gross profit decreased  from million for to million for  representing gross margins of and  respectively 
the increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to decreased health insurance  housing and retirement costs as a percentage of revenue  partially offset by increases in temporary healthcare professionals compensation 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding non cash stock based compensation  increased  from million for to million for the million increase was primarily attributable to an increase in expenses related to corporate facilities as we occupied a larger corporate facility for a full year compared to a half year in and corporate employee and professional services increases related to additional compliance requirements in connection with compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of in addition  we recorded an increase in our professional liability insurance reserve as we have experienced negative trends in our malpractice claims development 
these increases were partially offset by a million charge in the fourth quarter of related to vested stock options purchased in our october tender offer that was not incurred during non cash stock based compensation 
we recorded non cash compensation charges of million in and million in in connection with our stock option plans to reflect the difference between the fair market value at the measurement date and the exercise prices of previously issued stock options  which are amortized over their respective vesting periods 
amortization and depreciation 
amortization expense was million in and million in depreciation expense increased from million for to million for this increase was primarily attributable to internally developed software placed into service in and and additions of leasehold improvements and assets acquired in connection with the consolidation of several san diego  california locations into a new corporate headquarters facility during the second half of other expense  net 
interest expense  net  was million for as compared to million for  due primarily to interest charges related to borrowings initiated under our credit facility in october to fund our tender offer and the amortization of deferred financing costs associated with those borrowings 
in addition  interest expense was also higher due to the write off of million of deferred financing costs during related to million in voluntary prepayments on our long term debt 
income tax expense 
income tax expense decreased from million for to million for  reflecting effective income tax rates of and for these periods  respectively 
the reduction in the effective income tax rate was primarily attributable to changes in the state tax provision in comparison of results for the year ended december  to the year ended december  revenue 
revenue decreased  from million for to million for this decrease was comparable to the decrease in the number of temporary healthcare professionals on assignment  which decreased from an average of  for to an average of  for of the million decrease  approximately million was attributable to the contraction in our existing brands through a decline in the average number of temporary healthcare professionals on assignment and million was attributable to a shift in the mix from payroll to flat rate contracts 
these decreases were partially offset by improvements in contract terms in our existing brands  which included increases in bill rates charged to hospital and healthcare facility clients  of approximately million

table of contents favorable collections  reductions in employee expenses related to the decline in the average number of temporary healthcare professionals on assignment and reductions in professional services

amortization and depreciation 
amortization expense of million was consistent for and  as there were no significant changes in the carrying values of intangible assets subject to amortization 
depreciation expense increased from million for to million for the increase was primarily attributable to internally developed software placed into service in  amortization of assets acquired under capital leases  and additions of leasehold improvements and assets acquired in connection with the consolidation of several san diego  california locations into our new corporate headquarters facility during the second half of transaction costs 
transaction costs of million for represent non capitalized costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of hrmc 
other expense income  net 
interest expense income  net  was income of million for as compared to expense of million for  due primarily to the liquidation of investments held in  interest charges related to the amendment of our revolving credit facility in october  and the amortization of deferred financing costs associated with our debt issuance 
income tax expense 
income tax expense decreased from million for to million for  reflecting effective income tax rates of and for these periods  respectively

liquidity and capital resources historically  our primary liquidity requirements have been for acquisitions  working capital requirements and debt service under our credit facility 
we have funded these requirements through internally generated cash flow and funds borrowed under our credit facility 
at december   million was outstanding under our credit facility 
we believe that cash generated from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next months 
we expect to be able to finance future acquisitions either with cash provided from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility  bank loans  debt or equity offerings  or some combination of the foregoing 
the following discussion provides further details of our liquidity and capital resources 
operating activities historically  our principal working capital need has been for accounts receivable 
at december  and december   our days sales outstanding dso was days and days  respectively 
the decrease in dso was primarily related to the return to normal client billing and collection processes during after a temporary delay in client billings associated with the implementation of a new payroll and billing system initiated in november and the resulting improvement of these processes due to the upgraded system 
our principal sources of cash to fund our working capital needs are cash generated from operating activities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
net cash provided by operations decreased million from million in to million in this decrease in net cash provided by operations was primarily related to the decrease in net income compared to the prior year  offset by the collection of accounts receivable and the reduction in dso 

table of contents investing activities we continue to have relatively low capital investment requirements 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  our capital expenditures were million for purchased and internally developed software and million for computers  furniture and equipment  leasehold improvements and other expenditures 
the higher level of capital expenditures in was primarily related to leasehold improvements for our new corporate headquarters 
we expect our future capital expenditure requirements to be similar to  in relation to revenue 
our business acquisition expenditures were million in and in and in april  we completed the acquisition of hrmc 
this acquisition was financed with cash provided by operations 
financing activities in november  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing a repurchase of up to million of our common stock on the open market from time to time through december stock repurchases were subject to prevailing market conditions and other considerations  including limitations under applicable securities laws 
under the terms of the repurchase program  we repurchased  shares at an average purchase price of per share  or an aggregate of million 
we do not currently have any authorized stock repurchase programs 
on october   we completed a tender offer for an aggregate of million  or approximately million shares of our common stock and certain employee stock options

on july   we amended our credit facility to provide for increased flexibility under our financial covenants  an increase in the amount available under our letter of credit sub facility and a basis point increase in the interest rate margin in the event of a downgrade in our credit rating 
based on our outstanding indebtedness at december   a downgrade in our credit rating and the resulting revised pricing would increase our interest expense by approximately  on an annualized basis 
since the amendment of our credit facility in july  we have not had a downgrade in our credit rating 
the revolving credit facility carries an unused fee of per annum  and there are no mandatory reductions in the revolving commitment under the revolving credit facility 
borrowings under this revolving credit facility bear interest at floating rates based upon either a libor or a prime interest rate option selected by us  plus a spread  to be determined based on our leverage ratio

the five year  million term loan portion of our credit facility is subject to quarterly amortization of principal in equal installments  with an amount equal to of the initial aggregate principal amount of the facility payable quarterly 
these quarterly payments began on june  and continue until with any remaining amounts payable in voluntary prepayments of the term loan portion of the credit facility are applied ratably to the remaining quarterly amortization payments 
we paid the initial principal installment of million on june   and the second and third mandatory installments of million and million on september  and december   respectively 
the mandatory installments were reduced after the initial installment due to the million of voluntary prepayments made during the second half of in addition  we wrote off million of deferred financing costs  which is included in interest expense  during the year ended december  related to these voluntary prepayments 

table of contents we are required to make additional mandatory prepayments on the term loan within ninety days after the end of each fiscal year  commencing with the fiscal year ending december  the prepayment required is equal to of our excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement  less any voluntary prepayments made during the fiscal year 
the mandatory prepayment amount  if any  is applied ratably to the remaining quarterly amortization payments 
the voluntary prepayments made during satisfied this additional prepayment requirement for the year ending december  we are also required to maintain interest rate protection on at least of the term loan portion of our credit facility until january  on october   we entered into three interest rate swap arrangements to minimize our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on million of our outstanding variable rate debt under our credit facility 
as of december   we have two interest rate swap agreements in place to minimize our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on million of our outstanding variable rate debt under our credit facility 
the two swaps have notional amounts of  and  whereby we pay fixed rates of and  respectively  and receive a floating three month libor 
the first agreement expired in september  and the remaining two agreements expire in september and september  respectively  and no initial investments were made to enter into these agreements 
at december  and  the interest rate swap agreements had a fair value of  and  respectively  which is included in other assets and other liabilities  respectively  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we have formally documented the hedging relationships and account for these arrangements as cash flow hedges 
as of december   this credit facility also served to collateralize certain letters of credit aggregating million  issued by us in the normal course of business
