item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview during the fourth quarter of  the company restructured certain of its fhlb borrowings to reduce interest costs in future years  shorten the duration of its liabilities  reduce repricing risk  and eliminate the callable feature 
in the debt restructuring  the company prepaid million of its callable fixed rate borrowings and replaced that debt with million of new non callable fhlb borrowings 
the company structured the transaction in a manner it initially believed  based on its analysis and discussions with the company s independent registered public accounting firm  would allow for extinguishment of debt accounting pursuant to emerging issues task force no 
 debtor s accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments eitf 
extinguishment of debt accounting would have resulted in the recognition of million in prepayment penalties associated with the restructuring in the fourth quarter of as a charge to non interest expense and significantly reduced the company s interest expense in future periods 
subsequent to december   it was determined that the technical requirements for extinguishment of debt accounting of eitf were not satisfied 
as a result  the company recognized million on the early extinguishment of debt as a charge to non interest expense during the fourth quarter of and deferred the remaining million prepayment penalty in accordance with eitf during the fourth quarter of  the company amortized as an adjustment to the cost of the new borrowings million of interest expense 
the remaining million of prepayment penalties as of december  will be recognized in interest expense as an adjustment to the cost of the company s borrowings in future periods 
the increase in interest expense related to the remaining prepayment penalties is expected to be million  million  million  million and  in the years ended december     and  respectively 
although the accounting for this transaction under eitf did not allow the company to reduce its interest costs immediately  the company anticipates the restructuring will have a positive overall effect in future periods by  among other things  improving the company s interest rate risk profile 
during the year ended december   the financial services industry continued to be impacted by the low interest rate environment 
the company was able to make strides in increasing its net interest margin by effectively managing its cost of deposits and redeploying certain lower yielding interest earning assets into higher yielding loans 
the company s net interest income before the provision for losses on loans improved during to million compared to million for  an increase of 
the company s net interest margin increased to for the year ended december  from for as discussed below  the composition of the company s loan portfolio has changed significantly in recent years 
the amounts of the company s commercial real estate  construction and land development and commercial and industrial loans have become the predominant types of loans in the company s loan portfolio 
these types of loans amounted to  in the aggregate  of the total loan portfolio at december  compared to at december  see changes in financial position loan portfolio composition in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below 
commercial loans are generally deemed to involve a greater degree of risk than single family residential mortgage loans 
during the year ended december   the company s charge offs of commercial real estate  construction and land development and commercial and industrial loans amounted to million in the aggregate  or of total charge offs for the year 
while the company believes the amount of its allowance for losses on loans at december  is appropriate  no assurance can be given that additional charge offs and or provisions to the allowance for losses on loans may not be required in the future 
the company increased its provision for losses on loans by million in compared to  primarily as a result of increased impairment allocations related to eight loans 
in addition  the company s financial results for were also adversely impacted by the following legal expenses of million related to the company s goodwill litigation  a million impairment of a trust preferred security deemed to be other than temporarily impaired during the year  the write down of  in viatical receivables held by the bank that were determined to be impaired  and an increase in loan collection expenses of  compared to the company also incurred an additional million in compensation expense related to the resignation of a senior executive officer 
this increase  however  was partially offset by an overall decrease of million in pension related expenses during as compared to critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the company to establish various accounting policies 
certain of these accounting policies require management to make estimates  judgments or assumptions that could have a material effect on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience  projected results  internal cash flow modeling techniques and other factors which management believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
the company s significant accounting policies are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
these policies along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this management s discussion and analysis  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
management views critical accounting policies to be those which are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments  estimates and assumptions  and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the financial statements 
management currently views the determination of the allowance for losses on loans to be a critical accounting policy 
allowance for losses on loans 
the company maintains an allowance for losses on loans at a level management believes is sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for losses on loans represents the company s estimate of probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio at each balance sheet date and is based on the review of available and relevant information 
one component of the allowance for losses on loans contains allocations for probable inherent but undetected losses within various pools of loans with similar characteristics pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for contingencies 
this component is based in part on certain loss factors applied to various loan pools as stratified by the company 
in determining the appropriate loss factors for these loan pools  management considers historical charge offs and recoveries  levels of and trends in delinquencies  impaired loans and other classified loans  concentrations of credit within the commercial loan portfolios  volume and type of lending  and current and anticipated economic conditions 
the second component of the allowance for losses on loans contains allocations for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships pursuant to sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
this component of the allowance for losses on loans consists of expected losses resulting in specific credit allocations for individual loans not considered within the above mentioned loan pools 
the analysis on each loan involves a high degree of judgment in estimating the amount of the loss associated with the loan  including the estimation of the amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values 
loan losses are charged off against the allowance  while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
the company assesses the adequacy of the allowance for losses on loans on a quarterly basis and adjusts the allowance for losses on loans by recording a provision for losses on loans in an amount sufficient to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level 
the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for losses on loans is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available or as future events occur 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from management estimates  an additional provision for losses on loans could be required that could adversely affect earnings or the company s financial position in future periods 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination processes  periodically review the provision for losses on loans for citizens and the carrying value of its other non performing assets  based on information available to them at the time of their examinations 
any of these agencies could require the bank to make additional provisions for losses on loans in the future

the company recognized a net loss for the year ended december  of million  or a loss per share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share per basic share  for the year ended december  the net loss was primarily a result of a million charge to non interest expense related to the company s million debt restructure which occurred during the fourth quarter of and an increase in the provision for losses on loans to million from million for the year ended december  also adversely impacting the company s results for the year ended december  were the following legal expenses of million related to the company s goodwill litigation  a million impairment of a trust preferred security deemed to be other than temporarily impaired during the year  the write down of  in viatical receivables held by the bank that were determined to be impaired  and an increase in loan collection expenses of  compared to the company also incurred an additional million in compensation expense related to the resignation of a senior executive officer 
however  this increase was partially offset by an overall decrease of million in pension related expenses during as compared to net interest income 
net interest income before the provision for losses on loans is the principal source of earnings for the company and consists of interest income received on loans and investment securities less interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income is a function of the company s interest rate spread  which is the difference between the average yield earned on the company s interest earning assets and the average rate paid on its interest bearing liabilities  and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the company s net interest margin  which is net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets  for the year ended improved to from for the company s net interest income before the provision for losses on loans for the year ended december  totaled million and represented an increase from million for the year ended december  the increase in the net interest income and the net interest margin for the year was mainly the result of effective management of the cost of deposits combined with the redeployment of lower yielding other interest earning assets into higher yielding loans 
although the company refinanced its fhlb debt at lower fixed rates  the amortization of a portion of the prepayment penalties negatively impacted the net interest margin for the year ended december  the company expects the net interest margin to continue to be adversely impacted as a direct result of the amortization through interest expense of the remaining prepayment penalty during and in future years 
interest income 
the company reported total interest income of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in average interest earning assets during from which was partially offset by a slight increase of basis points in the yield of average interest earning assets 
the company was able to redeploy certain lower yielding interest earning assets into higher yielding loans throughout as well as use some of the repayments received on lower yielding assets to prepay a portion of its fhlb borrowings 
during the year ended december  compared to the previous year  the company s average loan balances increased million or while the average balance of the company s other interest earning assets including the company s money market accounts  federal funds sold and interest bearing bank deposits decreased million or 
interest expense 
during  the company proactively managed its cost of interest bearing deposits and borrowings and reduced interest expense by million or as compared to total interest expense amounted to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  interest expense on deposits decreased to million during from primarily as a result of a basis point reduction in the average rate paid on total deposits coupled with a million decrease in the average balance of total deposits 
the company continues to focus on increasing core deposits as a means of managing its total cost of deposits 
interest expense on borrowings during decreased by  from primarily as a result of the overall lower average level of debt during included in interest expense in is the amortization of million in prepayment penalties recognized as a result of the debt restructuring completed in the fourth quarter of the company expects that the fourth quarter restructuring of the fhlb advances will continue to impact interest expense as the remaining prepayment penalties are amortized as an adjustment to the cost of the new borrowings 
additional interest expense related to the amortization of the remaining prepayment penalties is expected to be million  million  million  million and  in the years ended december     and  respectively 
provision for losses on loans 
the company s provision for losses on loans was million for the year ended december  compared to million in the million increase in the provision was mainly the result of the company s increased impairment allocation for impaired loans coupled with an increase in the amount of loan charge offs during during  the company identified eight impaired loans with a total aggregate balance of million 
the aggregate required impairment allocation was million  an increase from the previous allocation of million for these loans 
each of these eight loans was reviewed for impairment based upon updated information received in conjunction with its overall evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for losses on loans 
this updated information identified either a change in the borrower s ability to perform their loan obligations or in the estimated value of the collateral 
see additional information regarding the increases in the provision included in the allowance for losses on loans section below in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section 
non interest income 
the company s service charges and other fees increased by  or for the full year of compared to the increases were primarily related to service charges generated by the company s overdraft protection privilege product provided to both retail and business customers 
in  the company was able to realize a full year of income related to its business overdraft privilege which was introduced in july the company also increased the number of non interest bearing checking accounts by approximately since december  which added to the increase in service charges and other fees on deposit accounts 
during the fourth quarter of  the company also realized a  gain on the sale of land and an office building 
prior to the sale  the building was leased to a company that acquired the assets of the cfs insurance agency  inc in november the improvements in service charges and other fees in the periods were more than offset by changes in the amount of net realized gains on sales of securities and losses realized in the cost basis of one impaired security in compared to net realized gains on sales of securities were  for the year ended december  compared to million for during  the company also recorded an impairment write down of million related to the other than temporary impairment of one trust preferred security that had an original cost basis of million 
non interest expense 
the company s non interest expense for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million for the year ended december  the majority of this increase relates to the million of prepayment penalties that were expensed during as part of the company s restructuring of its fhlb borrowings 
exclusive of the prepayment penalties  the most significant changes in the company s non interest expense in compared to were in professional fees  which increased  data processing costs  which increased  and other general and administrative expenses  which increased  the increase in professional fees was due primarily to million of legal expenses incurred during in connection with the company s goodwill case that went to trial during the year 
the increased data processing charges related to the conversion to a new processor 
the increase in other general and administrative costs was primarily due to charges relating to the write down of the carrying value of certain viatical receivables by  to  an increase in loan collection expense of  was also a factor in the increase in other general and administrative costs 
the company also incurred million of compensation expense relating to the resignation of a senior executive officer during this increase in compensation expense was partially offset by a million decrease in pension expense for as compared to income tax expense 
the company s income tax benefit for the year ended december  totaled million 
the recognition during the year ended december  of income tax benefits was a significant change from the income tax expense incurred during the significant shift from income tax expense to income tax benefits during was the result of the pre tax losses combined with the application of available tax credits  the effects of permanent tax differences on the company s pre tax earnings and the reversal of tax accruals no longer considered necessary 
the available tax credits and permanent tax differences are expected to have a favorable impact on income tax expense throughout year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income 
net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share per basic share  compared to million  or per diluted share per basic share  for the year ended december  the historically low interest rate environment which prevailed throughout caused further deterioration in the company s net interest margin 
net interest income for the year ended december  decreased by million or from the year ended december  the company s results for the year ended december  were also adversely affected by a million contribution to the company s defined benefit pension plan to keep the plan appropriately funded and to avoid significantly higher estimated contributions in future years 
as with many pension plans  the company s plan had been adversely affected by three years of declining investment returns and record low interest rates which caused the level of funded benefits to drop significantly 
net interest income 
the company s average interest rate spread was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company s net interest margin was and during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company s net interest income for the year ended december  totaled million and represented a million decrease from million for the year ended december  the decrease in net interest income in was due primarily to the combined effects of the low interest rate environment and lower average balances of interest earning assets for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  interest income 
the company reported total interest income of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million or decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in average interest earning assets as well as a decrease in the average yield on interest earning assets of basis points for the year ended december  as compared to the average balances of the company s interest earning assets continued to decline during as a result of unprecedented refinancing activity which caused significant rate reductions within the loan portfolio and accelerated amortization of premiums on its mortgage backed securities portfolio 
given the low interest rate environment during  the company reinvested these funds predominantly in relatively low yielding assets with estimated average durations of two years or less as well as overnight funds with the expectation that they will be readily available for investment in higher yielding assets when the interest rate cycle turns upward 
during  the company made considerable progress in its strategy to transfer assets from lower yielding securities to higher yielding loans 
during the year ended december  compared to the previous year  average loan balances increased million or while the average balance of the company s securities portfolio decreased million or interest expense 
in contrast to the adverse impact on the asset side of the balance sheet  the low interest rate environment in provided some positive opportunities on the funding side 
the company proactively managed its funding costs throughout by aggressively lowering the interest rate paid on its core deposits which historically have not been rate sensitive 
total interest expense amounted to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million or reduction in interest expense during was primarily the result of an basis point reduction in the average rate paid on interest bearing deposits coupled with a million decrease in the average balance of interest bearing deposits 
provision for losses on loans 
the company s provision for losses on loans was million for the year ended december  compared to million in the increase in provision was a result of the company s increased emphasis on growing the commercial real estate and multi family residential loan portfolios which are generally deemed to involve more risk of loss than single family residential real estate loans 
this change in emphasis has resulted in an increase in the allowance for losses on loans 
non interest income 
the company reported non interest income of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the primary reasons for the increase in non interest income in compared to were a million increase in service charges and other fees  and million increase in net gains on the sale of securities  which were partially offset compared to the company s results in by the absence of insurance commissions of million and the million net gain on the sale of the company s insurance agency that were realized during the increase in service charges and other fees during was mainly realized from the company s popular overdraft protection privilege offered to both retail and business checking customers 
the company also realized  of commission income during  which was the first full year of outsourcing its alternative investment program 
through this program  the company s third party outsourcing partner sold nearly million of tax deferred annuities and other investments as an alternative investment to our depositors 
non interest expense 
the company reported non interest expense of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  while the company s salary expense remained relatively stable during compared to  compensation and employee benefits expense increased as a result of a million payment to the company s defined benefit pension plan during the fourth quarter of as with many pension plans  the company s plan was adversely affected by three years of declining investment returns and record low interest rates which caused the level of funded benefits to drop significantly 
the voluntary contribution was made to keep the plan funded at a level deemed appropriate 
the company froze the benefits associated with this plan in march although no further benefits will accrue while the freeze remains in place  the freeze does not reduce the benefits accrued through march professional fees were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the increase in professional fees was mainly the result of the company hiring independent third parties to perform an information systems technology assessment which led to the decision to move forward to upgrade our core data processor and helped prioritize additional technology systems and upgrades  improve the processing and underwriting for the company s home equity lines of credit heloc program and implementation of our heloc equity access card  and implement new software designed to streamline and enhance the processing and underwriting of retail loans 
income tax expense 
the company s income tax expense amounted to  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company s effective tax rates were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the significant decrease in income tax expense was a result of lower pre tax income  the application of available tax credits and the effects of permanent tax differences on the lower pre tax earnings 
changes in financial condition general 
during the year ended december   the company s total assets decreased by million to billion from billion at december  the significant changes in the composition of the company s balance sheet during the year ended december  include a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million  net decrease in securities of million  net decrease in total deposits of million  and net decrease in fhlb borrowings of million 
the decrease in total assets was a direct result of a decrease in certificates of deposit and fhlb borrowings 
during  certificates of deposit decreased million due to managed runoff of above market rate certificates as they reached maturity 
partially offsetting the decrease in certificates was an increase in core deposits of million 
the company has continued to focus on obtaining lower costing core deposits through its promotional efforts and retail incentive programs 
during  the bank repaid million of fixed rate fhlb borrowings  of which million was repaid and replaced with million of new fhlb borrowings during the fourth quarter of subsequent to the debt restructuring  an additional million was repaid by the company during the fourth quarter of the company incurred million of prepayment penalties related to the debt restructuring  of which  million is being deferred as an adjustment to the carrying value of the total debt outstanding and will be recognized in interest expense as an adjustment to the cost of the borrowings over their remaining life

the company purchased total commercial real estate participations of million which was more than offset by million of commercial real estate participations sold 
the company s construction and land development loan portfolio increased as a result of over million of originations and million of participations purchased 
the company s construction and land development loans had million of available credit under construction loans and land development lines of credit as of december  the company s commercial and industrial loan portfolio also increased due to new fundings of over million and participations purchased of million 
both the construction and land development and the commercial and industrial loan portfolios were also impacted by principal repayments 
during  the company s single family residential loan portfolio continued to decline as repayments more than offset new originations of over million 
the bank also sold million of fixed rate single family residential mortgage loans with servicing released during the continued decline in single family residential loans since in each of the last three years is primarily due to the high levels of refinancing and prepayments experienced throughout the industry 
given the lower interest rate environment during the past three years  the company focused on originating more variable rate products  including helocs 
total helocs originated during were over million and were partially offset by repayments 
as of december   the company had million in unused helocs 
the company s other loans consist mainly of million in participations purchased for indirect auto loans during which were offset by repayments on all consumer loans 
as reflected in the preceding table  the company s portfolio of commercial real estate loans has increased significantly in recent years 
at december   these loans represented of the company s total loan portfolio 
in addition  the company s construction and land development loans and commercial and industrial loans have increased and  at december   represented and  respectively  of the company s total loan portfolio 
these types of commercial loans are all generally deemed to have a higher degree of risk than single family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the project or business or the successful completion of the construction project 
local and general economic conditions  supply and demand  the abilities of the borrower to manage the creditor s operations  and many other factors  affect the borrower s ability to repay 
included in the company s commercial and construction loan portfolio is an aggregate of million or of the company s total loan portfolio  of loans to the hotel and motel industry 
the company has no other concentrations of loans to any industry exceeding of its total loan portfolio 
the hotel and motel business is very competitive and the success of the hotel and motel operators and their ability to repay loans is dependent on local and general economic conditions among other factors

contractual principal repayments and interest rates 
the following table sets forth scheduled contractual amortization of the bank s loans at december   as well as the dollar amount of such loans which are scheduled to mature after one year which have fixed or adjustable interest rates 
demand loans  loans having no scheduled repayments and no stated maturity  and overdraft loans are reported as due in one year or less

scheduled contractual loan amortization does not reflect the expected term of the bank s loan portfolio 
the average life of loans is substantially less than their contractual terms because of prepayments and due on sale clauses  which give the bank the right to declare a conventional loan immediately due and payable in the event  among other things  that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the average life of mortgage loans tends to increase when current market rates of interest for mortgage loans are higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and  conversely  decrease when rates on existing mortgage loans are higher than current market rates as borrowers refinance adjustable rate and fixed rate loans at lower rates 
under the latter circumstance  the weighted average yield on loans decreases as higher yielding loans are repaid or refinanced at lower rates 
allowance for losses on loans the allowance for losses on loans is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb estimated probable loan losses 
management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on the company s past loan loss experience  known and inherent losses in the portfolio  evaluations of real estate collateral  composition of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions and levels of non performing and other classified loans 
loans which are determined to be uncollectible are charged off against the allowance for losses on loans and recoveries of loans that were previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
see further analysis in the critical accounting policies previously discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as well as note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s charge off policy varies with respect to the category of and specific circumstances surrounding each loan under consideration 
the company records charge offs on the basis of management s ongoing evaluation of collectibility 
as of december   the bank s allowance for losses on loans amounted to million or and of the bank s non performing loans and total loans receivable  respectively 
the bank s provision for losses on loans amounted to million for the year ended december  and million for management of the company believes that  as of december   the allowance for losses on loans was adequate

allocation of the allowance for losses on loans 
the bank allocates its allowance for losses on loans by loan category

all of the bank s assets are subject to review under its classification system 
see discussion on classified and criticized assets 
loans are periodically reviewed by the bank s loan committee 
the board of directors also reviews the classified assets on a quarterly basis 
when a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan  the bank attempts to cure the deficiency by contacting the borrower and seeking payment 
contacts are generally made prior to days after a payment is due 
late charges are generally assessed after days with additional efforts being made to collect the past due payments 
while the bank generally prefers to work with borrowers to resolve such problems  when the account becomes days delinquent  the bank may institute foreclosure or other proceedings  as deemed necessary  to minimize any potential loss 
loans are placed on non accrual status when  in the judgment of management  the probability of collection of interest is deemed to be insufficient to warrant further accrual 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  previously accrued but unpaid interest is deducted from interest income 
the bank does not accrue interest on loans past due days or more 
real estate acquired by the bank as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as other real estate owned until sold 
foreclosed assets are held for sale and such assets are carried at the lower of fair value minus estimated costs to sell the property or cost generally the balance of the loan on the property at the date of acquisition 
after the date of acquisition  all costs incurred in maintaining the property are expensed  and costs incurred for the improvement or development of such property are capitalized up to the extent of the property s net realizable value

one loan totaling million secured by a hotel in the chicago metropolitan area was transferred to non accrual during the second quarter of and was subsequently written down through an impairment allocation to a balance of million as of december  the loan was still considered impaired and has a remaining estimated impairment allocation of million as of december  during december  bank management negotiated a forbearance agreement extending the maturity of the loan through may when the loan is required to be paid off 
in conjunction with the forbearance agreement  the borrower placed the title of the property in escrow 
the borrowers have the opportunity for a day extension if they pay additional funds on the loan

see legal proceedings for more details 
based on the collateral values  the company believes there is little risk of loss related to the outstanding balance of these loans as of december  partially offsetting the above increases in non performing commercial real estate loans  the bank foreclosed on and transferred a million motel loan to other real estate owned prior to it being sold for million during the second quarter of also  the bank received the full payoff during the second quarter of of a million loan secured by a strip mall that was transferred to non performing status during the fourth quarter of the decrease in non performing loans related to construction and land development related to the full payoff of two loans totaling million in the aggregate and the million partial charge off of a non performing commercial construction loan secured by an apartment complex 
the amount charged off on this loan was equal to the impairment allocation identified at the end of the third quarter of the interest income that would have been recorded during the year ended december   if all of the bank s non performing loans at the end of such period had been current in accordance with their terms during such periods  was million 
the actual amount of interest recorded as income on a cash basis on such loans during the period amounted to  classified and criticized assets 
federal regulations require that each insured institution classify its assets on a regular basis 
furthermore  in connection with examinations of insured institutions  federal examiners have authority to identify problem assets and  if appropriate  classify them 
there are three classifications for problem assets substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values questionable  and there is a high probability of loss 
loss assets are considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted 
federal examiners have designated another category as special mention for assets which have some identified weaknesses but do not currently expose an insured institution to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification as substandard  doubtful or loss 
as of december   the bank had an aggregate of million of classified assets  of which were classified substandard and of which were classified as doubtful  compared to million of classified assets as of december  securities as of december   all of the company s investment securities were classified as available for sale 
securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are recognized as direct increases or decreases in equity  net of applicable deferred income taxes

the company held no callable gse securities at december  or december  the company also held no commercial paper at december the decrease in total securities from december  to december  was primarily a result of the company selling approximately million of securities available for sale during the fourth quarter of in conjunction with the restructuring of its fhlb debt in order to fund the prepayment penalties incurred in the restructuring 
the remainder of the decline related to the sale of securities during the second quarter of as the company took advantage of a steep yield curve to reposition its investment portfolio 
during  management identified one impaired trust preferred security 
write downs to fair value of million were made during when the issuer first deferred an interest payment during the second quarter of and again when the issuer announced the continuation of interest deferral on the trust preferred securities coupled with the sale of a significant portion of the issuer s assets  continuing restructuring objectives  and regulatory restrictions on the issuer 
as of december   the new carrying value of this trust preferred security was  which was equal to its market value 
management does not believe any remaining individual unrealized loss as of december  represents an other than temporary ott impairment 
the unrealized losses reported for agency securities  mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are  in their entirety  on securities issued by the federal government  its agencies or gses  including the federal national mortgage association fnma  the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac and the government national mortgage association gnma  and in management s belief  are attributable to changes in interest rates and the resultant change in the shape of the yield curve 
the unrealized losses associated with equity securities relate to one issuance 
management believes that the unrealized loss is specifically related to the changes in interest rates and the resultant change in the shape of the yield curve 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding the maturities and weighted average yield of the company s securities as of december  the amounts listed in the table are based on carrying value and the yield is calculated based on amortized cost

as such  the maturities presented in the table for these securities are based on historical and estimated prepayment rates for the underlying mortgage collateral 
the estimated average lives may differ from actual principal cash flows since cash flows include prepayments and scheduled principal amortization 
security is impaired  therefore  the company has not calculated a related yield 
other securities include equity securities which have no stated maturity date and are not included in the average months to maturity

the majority of these certificates were originated during when the company offered above market rate short term certificates on new money deposits to attract new customers 
while the company did not offer similar promotions during  it may continue to use these types of promotions from time to time to build its customer base 
partially offsetting the decrease in certificates of deposit during was an increase in core deposits of million 
the company continues to manage its interest expense on deposits by effectively managing the cost of its deposits and by focusing on obtaining low cost core deposits through promotional efforts and retail incentive programs

off balance sheet obligations 
the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the company s exposure to credit loss in the event of non performance by the third party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments 
the company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
the following table details the amounts and expected maturities of significant commitments as of december  over one over three one year through through over or less three years five years five years total dollars in thousands commitments to extend credit commercial   retail   commitments to purchase loans commercial   commitments to fund unused construction loans      commitments to fund unused lines of credit commercial    retail    letters of credit    credit enhancements     the above listed commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements  in that certain of these commitments often expire without being drawn upon 
letters of credit include credit enhancements which are related to the issuance by municipalities of taxable and nontaxable revenue bonds 
the proceeds from the sale of such bonds are loaned to for profit and not for profit companies for economic development projects 
in order for the bonds to receive a triple a rating which provides for a lower interest rate  the fhlb in issues  in favor of the bond trustee  an irrevocable direct pay letter of credit for the account of the bank 
since the bank  in accordance with the terms and conditions of a reimbursement agreement between the fhlb in and the bank  would be required to reimburse the fhlb in for draws against the letter of credit  these facilities are analyzed  appraised  secured by real estate mortgages  and monitored as if the bank had funded the project initially

the company has not utilized and has no intention of utilizing derivatives or commodity contracts 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results generally in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in relative purchasing power over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
monetary items  such as cash  loans and deposits  are those assets and liabilities which are or will be converted into a fixed number of dollars regardless of changes in prices 
as a result  changes in interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than general inflation 
over short periods of time  interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the bank  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk irr 
this risk relates to changes in market interest rates which could adversely affect net interest income or the net portfolio value npv of its assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
irr is primarily the result of an imbalance between the price sensitivity of the bank s assets and its liabilities 
these imbalances can be caused by differences in the maturity  repricing  and coupon characteristics of assets and liabilities as well as options such as loan prepayment options 
the bank maintains a written asset liability management policy that establishes written guidelines for the asset liability management function  including the management of net interest margin  interest rate risk  and liquidity 
the asset liability management policy falls under the authority of the board of directors who in turn assigns its formulation  revision  and administration to the asset liability committee alco 
the alco meets monthly and consists of certain senior officers of the bank and one outside director 
the results of the monthly meetings are reported to the board of directors 
the primary duties of the alco are to develop reports and establish procedures to measure and monitor irr  verify compliance with board approved irr tolerance limits  take appropriate actions to mitigate those risks  monitor and discuss the status and results of implemented strategies and tactics  monitor the bank s capital position  review the current and prospective liquidity positions  and monitor alternative funding sources 
while maintaining its interest rate spread objectives  the bank attempts to reduce interest rate risk with a variety of strategies designed to maintain what the bank believes to be an appropriate relationship between its assets and liabilities 
first  the bank emphasizes real estate mortgage loans and commercial loans with adjustable interest rates or fixed rates of interest for an initial term of three or five years  that convert to an adjustable rate based on the one  three and five year constant maturity of united states treasury obligations as the index after the initial terms and for subsequent adjustment periods 
at december   the bank had approximately million of adjustable rate loans in its portfolio 
second  the bank s securities portfolio consists of securities that have expected average lives of five years or less at time of purchase 
at december   the modified duration of the securities portfolio was less than two years 
third  the bank has a substantial amount of savings  demand deposit and money market accounts which the bank believes may be less sensitive to changes in interest rates than certificate accounts 
at december   the bank had million of these types of accounts 
the bank utilizes the ots npv model as its primary method of monitoring its exposure to irr 
the npv represents the excess of the present value of expected cash flows from assets over the present value of expected cash flows from liabilities 
the npv model estimates the sensitivity of the bank s npv over a series of instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in interest rates 
on a quarterly basis  the alco reviews the calculations of npv as adjusted for expected cash flows from off balance sheets contracts  if any  for compliance with board approved tolerance limits 
the table below presents  as of december  and  an analysis of the bank s irr as measured by changes in npv for instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in the yield curve in basis point increments  up to basis points and down basis points in and in accordance with ots regulations 
as illustrated in the table  the bank s npv in the base case basis point change increased million from million at december  to million at december  the primary reason for the increase was a reduction in the effective duration of the bank s liabilities resulting from the restructuring of the company s fhlb advances completed in the fourth quarter of see further discussion regarding this restructure in the borrowed money section 
at december   the bank s overall sensitivity to interest rate risk has decreased in each of the assumed change in interest rate scenarios compared to december  net portfolio value year ended december  amount change change amount change change dollars in thousands assumed change in interest rates basis points as modeled above  the bank s npv increases nominally with an increase in interest rates of basis points while the npv decreases in each of the other rate scenarios 
the relatively small percentage change in the bank s npv in each of the rate scenarios indicates the price sensitivity of the bank s assets reasonably matches the price sensitivity of the bank s liabilities 
at december  and december   the bank was within the board approved tolerance limits in each rate scenario 
this npv model is a static model and does not consider potential adjustments of strategies by management on a dynamic basis in a volatile rate environment in order to protect or conserve equity values 
as such  actual results may vary from the modeled results 
the above analysis includes the assets and liabilities of the bank only 
inclusion of company only assets and liabilities would increase npv nominally at all levels
