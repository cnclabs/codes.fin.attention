item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company that discovers  develops  and intends to commercialize pharmaceutical products for the treatment of serious medical conditions 
we are currently conducting clinical programs for the vegf trap  il trap  and il trap  which are in various stages of development 
in addition to our clinical programs  we have research programs focused on angiogenesis  metabolic diseases  muscle atrophy and related disorders  inflammatory conditions  and other diseases and disorders 
we also use our velocigene and trap technology platforms to discover and develop new product candidates and are developing our velocimmune tm platform to create fully human  therapeutic antibodies 
developing and commercializing new medicines entails significant risk and expense 
since inception we have not generated any sales or profits from the commercialization of any of our product candidates and may never receive such revenues 
before revenues from the commercialization of our product candidates can be realized  we or our collaborators must overcome a number of hurdles which include successfully completing research and development and obtaining regulatory approval from the fda and regulatory authorities in other countries 
in addition  the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are rapidly evolving and highly competitive  and new developments may render our products and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete 
from inception on january  through december   we had a cumulative loss of million 
in the absence of revenues from the commercialization of our product candidates or other sources  the amount  timing  nature  or source of which cannot be predicted  our losses will continue as we conduct our research and development activities 
we expect to incur substantial losses over the next several years as we continue the clinical development of the vegf trap  il trap  and il trap  advance new product candidates into clinical development from our existing research programs  continue our research and development programs  and commercialize product candidates that receive regulatory approval  if any 
our activities may expand over time and may require additional resources  and we expect our operating losses to be substantial over at least the next several years 
our losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend  among other factors  on the progress of our research and development efforts  the timing of certain expenses  and the amount and timing of payments that we receive from collaborators 
as a company that does not expect to generate product revenues or profits over the next several years  management of cash flow is extremely important 
the most significant use of our cash is for research and development activities  which include drug discovery  preclinical studies  clinical trials  and the manufacture of drug supplies for preclinical studies and clinical trials 
in  our research and development expenses totaled million 
we expect these expenses  exclusive of non cash expenses related to grants of stock options  to increase in  depending on the progress of our clinical programs 
the principal sources of cash to date have been sales of common equity and convertible debt and funding from our collaborators in the form of up front payments  research progress payments  payments for our research and development activities  and purchases of our common stock 
we also receive payments for contract manufacturing 

table of contents a primary driver of our expenses is our number of full time employees 
our annual average headcount in was compared to in and in in  we expect our average headcount to increase to approximately  primarily to support our research and development programs 
the planning  execution  and results of our clinical programs are significant factors that can affect our operating and financial results 
in our clinical programs  key events in and plans for are as follows product candidate events plans vegf trap oncology completed phase subcutaneous single agent trial in cancer commence additional single agent and combination trials in cancer commenced phase intravenous single agent trial in cancer received fast track designation for vegf trap for specific niche cancer indication vegf trap eye diseases completed treatment portion of phase intravenous single agent trial in neovascular age related macular degeneration commence studies in eye diseases utilizing local delivery systems  such as intraocular injections completed treatment portion of phase intravenous single agent trial in diabetic macular edema il trap planned for future trials in rheumatoid arthritis completed treatment phase of single dose patient tolerability studies to evaluate new formulations commenced proof of concept study in cias associated periodic syndrome caps received fda orphan designation for the il trap in treatment of caps commence clinical trial in rheumatoid arthritis commence clinical trial in osteoarthritis commence exploratory proof of concept trials in other indications complete caps proof of concept study and commence additional trial in this indication evaluate il trap in other inflammatory conditions il trap completed phase trial in asthma commence clinical trial in asthma or allergy indication in september  we entered into a collaboration agreement with the sanofi aventis group to collaborate on the development and commercialization of the vegf trap 
sanofi aventis made a non refundable up front payment of million and purchased  newly issued unregistered shares of our common stock for million 
in january  we and sanofi aventis amended our collaboration agreement to exclude rights to develop and commercialize the vegf trap for eye diseases through local delivery systems 
in connection with this amendment  sanofi aventis made a million non refundable payment to us 
under the collaboration agreement  as amended  we and sanofi aventis will share co promotion rights and profits on sales  if any  of the vegf trap for disease indications included in our collaboration 
in december  we earned a million payment from sanofi aventis  which was received in january  upon the achievement of an early stage clinical milestone 
we may also receive up to million in additional milestone payments upon receipt of specified marketing approvals for up to eight vegf trap indications in europe or the united states 
regeneron has agreed to continue to manufacture clinical supplies of the vegf 
table of contents trap at our plant in rensselaer  new york 
sanofi aventis has agreed to be responsible for providing commercial scale manufacturing capacity for the vegf trap 
under the collaboration agreement  agreed upon development expenses incurred by both companies during the term of the agreement will be funded by sanofi aventis 
if the collaboration becomes profitable  we will reimburse sanofi aventis for of the vegf trap development expenses  including of the million payment received in connection with the january amendment to our collaboration agreement  in accordance with a formula based on the amount of development expenses and our share of the collaboration profits  or at a faster rate at our option 
since inception of the collaboration through december   we and sanofi aventis have incurred million in development expenses related to vegf trap program 
in addition  if the first commercial sale of a vegf trap product for disease of the eye through local delivery systems predates the first commercial sale of a vegf trap product under the collaboration by two years  we will begin reimbursing sanofi aventis for up to million of vegf trap development expenses in accordance with a formula until the first commercial vegf trap sale under the collaboration occurs 
sanofi aventis has the right to terminate the agreement without cause with at least twelve months advance notice 
upon termination of the agreement for any reason  any remaining obligation to reimburse sanofi aventis for of the vegf trap development expenses will terminate and we will retain all rights to the vegf trap 
in march  we entered into a collaboration agreement with novartis pharma ag to jointly develop and commercialize the il trap 
novartis made a non refundable payment of million and purchased  newly issued unregistered shares of our common stock for million 
in february  novartis provided notice of its intention not to proceed with the joint development of the il trap  and subsequently paid us million to satisfy its obligation to fund development costs for the nine month period following its notification and for the two months prior to that notice 
all rights to the il trap have reverted to regeneron 
novartis and we retain rights under the collaboration agreement to elect to collaborate in the future on the development and commercialization of certain other il antagonists 
in march  we also achieved a pre defined development milestone and novartis forgave all its outstanding development expense loans to us  totaling million

in addition to expenses incurred by us  sanofi aventis has incurred million in development expenses through december  related to the vegf trap program 
we and sanofi aventis plan to initiate multiple clinical studies in to evaluate the vegf trap as both a single agent and in combination with other therapies in various cancer indications 
during the third quarter of  the fda granted fast track designation to the vegf trap for a specific niche cancer indication 
as a result of the fda s decision  we and sanofi aventis plan to initiate a clinical trial in that indication in merck license agreement in august  merck granted to us a non exclusive license to certain patents and patent applications which may be used in the development and commercialization of axokine 
as consideration  we issued to merck  newly issued unregistered shares of our common stock the merck shares  valued at million based on the fair market value of shares of our common stock on the agreement s effective date 
in august  we repurchased from merck  and subsequently retired  the merck shares for million  based on the fair market value of the shares on august  we also made a cash payment of million to merck as required under the license agreement

funding requirements our total expenses for research and development from inception through december  have been approximately million 
we have entered into various agreements related to our activities to develop and commercialize product candidates and utilize our technology platforms  including collaboration agreements  such as with sanofi aventis  novartis  and procter gamble  and agreements to use our velocigene tm technology platform  such as with serono sa we incurred expenses associated with these agreements  which include an allocable portion of general and administrative costs  of million  million and million in   and  respectively 
we expect to continue to incur substantial funding requirements primarily for research and development activities including preclinical and clinical testing 
we currently anticipate that approximately of our expenditures for will be directed toward the preclinical and clinical development of product 
table of contents candidates  including the vegf trap  il trap  and il trap  approximately of our expenditures for will be applied to our basic research activities and the continued development of our novel technology platforms  and the remainder of our expenditures for will be used for capital expenditures and general corporate purposes 
in connection with our funding requirements  the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  for leases and long term debt 
none of these obligations extend beyond years 
payments due by period less than to to total one year years years in millions convertible senior subordinated notes payable operating leases includes amounts representing interest 
excludes future contingent rental costs for utilities  real estate taxes  and operating expenses 
in  these costs were million 
the amount we need to fund operations will depend on various factors  including the status of competitive products  the success of our research and development programs  the potential future need to expand our professional and support staff and facilities  the status of patents and other intellectual property rights  the delay or failure of a clinical trial of any of our potential drug candidates  and the continuation  extent  and success of any collaborative research and development collaborations including those with sanofi aventis and procter gamble 
clinical trial costs are dependent  among other things  on the size and duration of trials  fees charged for services provided by clinical trial investigators and other third parties  the costs for manufacturing the product candidate for use in the trials  supplies  laboratory tests  and other expenses 
the amount of funding that will be required for our clinical programs depends upon the results of our research and preclinical programs and early stage clinical trials  regulatory requirements  the clinical trials underway plus additional clinical trials that we decide to initiate  and the various factors that affect the cost of each trial as described above 
in the future  if we are able to successfully develop  market  and sell certain of our product candidates  we may be required to pay royalties or otherwise share the profits generated on such sales in connection with our collaboration and licensing agreements 
also under the terms of the sanofi aventis collaboration agreement  if the collaboration becomes profitable  we will reimburse sanofi aventis for percent of the vegf trap development expenses  including of the million payment received in connection with amending our collaboration agreement in january  in accordance with a formula based on the amount of development expenses and our share of the collaboration profits  or at a faster rate at our option 
in addition  if the first commercial sale of a vegf trap product for diseases of the eye through local delivery systems predates the first commercial sale of a vegf trap product under the collaboration  we will begin reimbursing sanofi aventis for up to million of vegf trap development expenses commencing two years after such initial commercialization outside the collaboration in accordance with a formula until the first commercial vegf trap sale under the collaboration occurs 
sanofi aventis has the right to terminate the agreement without cause with at least twelve months advance notice 
upon termination of the agreement for any reason  any remaining obligation to reimburse sanofi aventis for of the vegf trap development expenses will terminate and we will retain all rights to the vegf trap 
we expect that expenses related to the filing  prosecution  defense  and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property claims will continue to be substantial as a result of patent filings and prosecutions in the united states and foreign countries 
we believe that our existing capital resources will enable us to meet operating needs through at least mid however  this is a forward looking statement based on our current operating plan  and there may be a change in projected revenues or expenses that would lead to our capital being consumed significantly before such time 
if there is insufficient capital to fund all of our planned operations and activities  we believe we would prioritize available capital to fund preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates 
we 
table of contents have no off balance sheet arrangements and do not guarantee the obligations of any other entity 
as of december   we had no established banking arrangements through which we could obtain short term financing or a line of credit 
in the event we need additional financing for the operation of our business  we will consider collaborative arrangements and additional public or private financing  including additional equity financing 
in january  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s to sell  in one or more offerings  up to million of equity or debt securities  together or separately  which registration statement was declared effective in february however  there is no assurance that we will be able to complete any such offerings of securities 
factors influencing the availability of additional financing include our progress in product development  investor perception of our prospects  and the general condition of the financial markets 
we may not be able to secure the necessary funding through new collaborative arrangements or additional public or private offerings 
if we cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy our capital requirements  we may have to delay  scale back  or eliminate certain of our research and development activities or future operations 
this could harm our business 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates revenue recognition we recognize revenue from contract research and development and research progress payments in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab and emerging issues task force  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
during the third quarter of  we elected to change the method we use to recognize revenue under sab related to non refundable collaborator payments  including up front licensing payments  payments for development activities  and research progress milestone payments  to the substantive milestone method  adopted retroactively to january  under this method  we recognize revenue from non refundable up front license payments  not tied to achieving a specific performance milestone  ratably over the period over which we expect to perform services 
the period over which we expect to perform services is estimated based on product development plans 
these estimates are updated based on the results and progress of clinical trials and drug production and revisions to these estimates could result in changes to the amount of revenue recognized each year in the future 
in addition  if a collaborator terminates the agreement in accordance with the terms of the contract  we would recognize the remainder of the up front payment at the time of the termination 
payments for development activities are recognized as revenue as earned  ratably over the period of effort 
substantive at risk milestone payments  which are based on achieving a specific performance milestone  are recognized as revenue when the milestone is achieved and the related payment is due  provided there is no future service obligation associated with that milestone 
previously  we had recognized revenue from non refundable collaborator payments based on the percentage of costs incurred to date  estimated costs to complete  and total expected contract revenue 
however  the revenue recognized was limited to the amount of non refundable payments received 
the change in accounting method was made because we believe that it better reflects the substance of our collaborative agreements and is more consistent with current practices in the biotechnology industry 
in connection with our vegf trap collaboration agreement with sanofi aventis  in september  we received a non refundable up front payment of million which was recorded to deferred revenue and is being recognized as contract research and development revenue ratably over the period over which we are obligated to perform services 
in the fourth quarter of  we revised our estimate based on current vegf trap product development plans and extended the period over which we expect to be obligated to perform services under the collaboration by one year 
as a result  we anticipate that we will recognize approximately million of revenue related to the sanofi aventis million up front payment over each of the next years 
also  in connection with our collaboration agreement with novartis  in the first quarter of  novartis provided notice of its intention not to proceed with the joint development of the il trap 
accordingly  the remaining balance of the million up front payment  or million  was recognized as contract research and development revenue 

table of contents recognition of deferred revenue related to contract manufacturing agreement we have entered into a contract manufacturing agreement with merck under which we manufacture a vaccine intermediate at our rensselaer  new york facility and perform services 
we recognize contract manufacturing revenue from this agreement after the product is tested and approved by  and shipped fob shipping point to  merck  and as services are performed 
in connection with the agreement  we agreed to modify portions of our rensselaer facility to manufacture merck s vaccine intermediate and merck agreed to reimburse us for the related capital costs 
these capital cost payments were deferred and are recognized as revenue as product is shipped to merck  based upon our estimate of merck s order quantities each year through the expected end of the agreement which  for and prior years  was october since we commenced production of the vaccine intermediate in november  our estimates of merck s order quantities each year have not been materially different from merck s actual orders 
in february  we and merck amended our contract manufacturing agreement by extending its term by one year through october in addition  we provided merck the opportunity  upon twelve months prior notice  to extend the agreement for an additional year through october as a result  we will recognize the remaining deferred balance of merck s capital cost payments as of december   or million  as revenue as product is shipped to merck  based upon our revised estimate of merck s order quantities through october clinical trial accrual estimates for each clinical trial that we conduct  certain clinical trial costs  which are included in research and development expenses  are expensed based on the expected total number of patients in the trial  the rate at which patients enter the trial  and the period over which clinical investigators or contract research organizations are expected to provide services 
we believe that this method best aligns the expenses we record with the efforts we expend on a clinical trial 
during the course of a trial  we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates 
no material adjustments to our past clinical trial accrual estimates were made during the years ended december    and depreciation of property  plant and equipment property  plant  and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation is provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs which do not materially extend the useful lives of the assets are charged to expense as incurred 
the cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization of assets retired or sold are removed from the respective accounts  and any gain or loss is recognized in operations 
the estimated useful lives of property  plant  and equipment are as follows building and improvements years leasehold improvements life of lease laboratory and computer equipment years furniture and fixtures years in some situations  the life of the asset may be extended or shortened if circumstances arise that would lead us to believe that the estimated life of the asset has changed 
the life of leasehold improvements may change based on the extension of lease contracts with our landlords 
changes in the estimated lives of assets will result in an increase or decrease in the amount of depreciation recognized in future periods 
costs of construction of certain long lived assets include capitalized interest which is amortized over the estimated useful life of the related asset 
future impact of recently issued accounting standards in april  the emerging issues task force issued statement no 
 participating securities and the two class method under fasb statement no 
 earnings per share eitf 
eitf addresses a number of questions regarding the computation of earnings per share eps by companies that have issued securities other than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to participate in dividends 
table of contents and earnings of the company when  and if  it declares dividends on its common stock 
eitf defines participation rights based solely on whether the holder would be entitled to receive any dividends if the entity declared them during the period and requires the use of the two class method for computing basic eps when participating convertible securities exist 
in addition  eitf expands the use of the two class method to encompass other forms of participating securities and is effective for fiscal periods beginning after march  since we have no participating securities  our adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on our financial statements

risk factors we operate in an environment that involves a number of significant risks and uncertainties 
we caution you to read the following risk factors  which have affected  and or in the future could affect  our business  operating results  financial condition  and cash flows 
the risks described below include forward looking statements  and actual events and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
furthermore  additional risks and uncertainties are discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k and should be considered by our investors 
risks related to our financial results and need for additional financing we have had a history of operating losses and we may never achieve profitability 
if we continue to incur operating losses  we may be unable to continue our operations 
from inception on january  through december   we had a cumulative loss of million 
if we continue to incur operating losses and fail to become a profitable company  we may be 
table of contents unable to continue our operations 
we have no products that are available for sale and do not know when we will have products available for sale  if ever 
in the absence of revenue from the sale of products or other sources  the amount  timing  nature or source of which cannot be predicted  our losses will continue as we conduct our research and development activities 
we currently receive contract manufacturing revenue from our agreement with merck and contract research and development revenue from our agreements with procter gamble and serono 
our agreements with procter gamble and serono may expire in our agreement with merck is scheduled to expire before the end of  unless extended for one additional year by merck 
we can provide no assurance that all or any of these agreements will be extended 
failure to extend these agreements may negatively impact our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we will need additional funding in the future  which may not be available to us  and which may force us to delay  reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts 
we will need to expend substantial resources for research and development  including costs associated with clinical testing of our product candidates 
we believe our existing capital resources will enable us to meet operating needs through at least mid  however  our projected revenue may decrease or our expenses may increase and that would lead to our capital being consumed significantly before such time 
we will likely require additional financing in the future and we may not be able to raise such additional funds 
if we are able to obtain additional financing through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  such sales may be dilutive to our shareholders 
debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets or enter into covenants that would restrict our business activities or our ability to incur further indebtedness and may contain other terms that are not favorable to our shareholders 
if we are unable to raise sufficient funds to complete the development of our product candidates  we may face delay  reduction or elimination of our research and development programs or preclinical or clinical trials  in which case our business  financial condition or results of operations may be materially harmed 
we have a significant amount of debt and may have insufficient cash to satisfy our debt service and repayment obligations 
in addition  the amount of our debt could impede our operations and flexibility 
we have a significant amount of convertible debt and semi annual interest payment obligations 
this debt  unless converted to shares of our common stock  will mature in october we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on our debt 
even if we are able to meet our debt service obligations  the amount of debt we already have could hurt our ability to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes 
in addition  our debt obligations could require us to use a substantial portion of cash to pay principal and interest on our debt  instead of applying those funds to other purposes  such as research and development  working capital  and capital expenditures 
we intend to adopt  effective january   the fair market value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
this is expected to materially increase our non cash compensation expenses in our statement of operations commencing in  primarily due to compensation costs related to stock options 
we intend to adopt  effective january   the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation under the provisions of sfas statement of financial accounting standards no

we expect to begin recognizing this compensation cost in the first quarter of the impact of adopting sfas nos 
in has not yet been quantified 
however  had we adopted sfas nos 
effective january   our net income would have decreased by approximately million and our basic net income per share would have decreased from per share to per share

risks related to development of our product candidates successful development of any of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
only a small minority of all research and development programs ultimately result in commercially successful drugs 
we have never developed a drug that has been approved for marketing and sale  and we may never succeed in developing an approved drug 
even if clinical trials demonstrate safety and effectiveness of any of our product candidates for a specific disease and the necessary regulatory approvals are obtained  the commercial success of any of our product candidates will depend upon their acceptance by patients  the medical community  and third party payors and on our and our partners ability to successfully manufacture and commercialize our product candidates 
our product candidates are delivered either by intravenous  intravitreal or subcutaneous injections  which are generally less well received by patients than tablet or capsule delivery 
if our products are not successfully commercialized  we will not be able to recover the significant investment we have made in developing such products and our business would be severely harmed 
clinical trials required for our product candidates are expensive and time consuming  and their outcome is highly uncertain 
if any of our drug trials are delayed or achieve unfavorable results  we will have to delay or may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates 
we must conduct extensive testing of our product candidates before we can obtain regulatory approval to market and sell them 
we need to conduct both preclinical animal testing and human clinical trials 
conducting these trials is a lengthy  time consuming  and expensive process 
these tests and trials may not achieve favorable results for many reasons  including  among others  failure of the product candidate to demonstrate safety or efficacy  the development of serious or life threatening adverse events or side effects caused by or connected with exposure to the product candidate  difficulty in enrolling and maintaining subjects in the clinical trial  lack of sufficient supplies of the product candidate  and the failure of clinical investigators  trial monitors and other consultants  or trial subjects to comply with the trial plan or protocol 
a clinical trial may fail because it did not include a sufficient number of patients to detect the endpoint being measured or reach statistical significance 
a clinical trial may also fail because the dose s of the investigational drug included in the trial were either too low or too high to determine the optimal effect of the investigational drug in the disease setting 
for example  we intend to study higher doses of the il trap after a previous phase trial of the il trap in subjects with rheumatoid arthritis failed to achieve its primary endpoint 
additional clinical trial risks and examples of our prior clinical trials which did not achieve favorable results are described in the risk factor below entitled a previous phase study evaluating axokine demonstrated modest average weight loss over a month period 
in addition  a completed phase study evaluating the il trap in patients with rheumatoid arthritis failed to achieve its primary endpoint 
we will need to reevaluate any drug candidate that does not test favorably and either conduct new trials  which are expensive and time consuming  or abandon the drug development program 
even if we obtain positive results from preclinical or clinical trials  we may not achieve the same success in future trials 
many companies in the biopharmaceutical industry  including us  have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials  even after promising results have been obtained in earlier trials 
the failure of clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness for the desired indication s could harm the development of the product candidate s  and our business  financial condition  and results of operations may be materially harmed 

table of contents the development of serious or life threatening side effects with any of our product candidates would lead to delay or discontinuation of development  which could severely harm our business 
during the conduct of clinical trials  patients report changes in their health  including illnesses  injuries  and discomforts  to their study doctor 
often  it is not possible to determine whether or not the drug candidate being studied caused these conditions 
various illnesses  injuries  and discomforts have been reported from time to time during clinical trials of our product candidates 
although our current drug candidates appeared to be generally well tolerated in clinical trials conducted to date  it is possible as we test any of them in larger  longer  and more extensive clinical programs  illnesses  injuries  and discomforts that were observed in earlier trials  as well as conditions that did not occur or went undetected in smaller previous trials  will be reported by patients 
many times  side effects are only detectable after investigational drugs are tested in large scale  phase clinical trials or  in some cases  after they are made available to patients after approval 
if additional clinical experience indicates that any of our product candidates has many side effects or causes serious or life threatening side effects  the development of the product candidate may fail or be delayed  which would severely harm our business 
our vegf trap is being studied for the potential treatment of certain types of cancer and diseases of the eye 
there are many potential safety concerns associated with significant blockade of vascular endothelial growth factor  or vegf 
these risks  based on the clinical and preclinical experience of systemically delivered vegf inhibitors  including the vegf trap  include bleeding  hypertension  and proteinuria 
these serious side effects and other serious side effects have been reported in our vegf trap studies in cancer and diseases of the eye 
in addition  patients given infusions of any protein  including the vegf trap delivered through intravenous administration  may develop severe hypersensitivity reactions  referred to as infusion reactions 
these and other complications or side effects could harm the development of the vegf trap for either the treatment of cancer or diseases of the eye 
although the il trap was generally well tolerated and was not associated with any drug related serious adverse events in the phase rheumatoid arthritis study completed in  safety or tolerability concerns may arise as we test higher doses of the il trap in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases and disorders 
like tnf antagonists such as enbrel a registered trademark of amgen and remicade a registered trademark of centocor  the il trap affects the immune defense system of the body by blocking some of its functions 
therefore  there may be an increased risk for infections to develop in patients treated with the il trap 
in addition  patients given infusions of the il trap delivered through intravenous administration have developed hypersensitivity reactions  referred to as infusion reactions 
these and other complications or side effects could harm the development of the il trap 
our product candidates in development are recombinant proteins that could cause an immune response  resulting in the creation of harmful or neutralizing antibodies against the therapeutic protein 
in addition to the safety  efficacy  manufacturing  and regulatory hurdles faced by our product candidates  the administration of recombinant proteins frequently causes an immune response  resulting in the creation of antibodies against the therapeutic protein 
the antibodies can have no effect or can totally neutralize the effectiveness of the protein  or require that higher doses be used to obtain a therapeutic effect 
in some cases  the antibody can cross react with the patient s own proteins  resulting in an auto immune type disease 
whether antibodies will be created can often not be predicted from preclinical or clinical experiments  and their appearance is often delayed  so that there can be no assurance that neutralizing antibodies will not be created at a later date in some cases even after pivotal clinical trials have been completed 
approximately two thirds of the subjects who received axokine in the completed phase study developed neutralizing antibodies 
in addition  subjects who received the il trap in clinical trials have developed antibodies 
it is possible that as we test the vegf trap in different patient populations and larger clinical trials  subjects given the vegf trap will develop antibodies to the product candidate 

table of contents a previous phase study evaluating axokine demonstrated modest average weight loss over a month period 
in addition  a completed phase study evaluating the il trap in patients with rheumatoid arthritis failed to achieve its primary endpoint 
in march  we reported data from the month treatment period of our initial phase pivotal trial of axokine 
although the phase study met its primary endpoints and individuals achieved a medically meaningful weight loss  the average weight loss was small and limited by the development of antibodies 
in october  we reported results from the first phase trial of our il trap in rheumatoid arthritis 
we plan to conduct large scale rheumatoid arthritis trials of the il trap in a larger patient population  testing higher doses than were tested in the previous phase trial for a longer period of time 
we plan to study higher doses of the il trap through subcutaneous injections and intravenous delivery 
however  higher doses may not lead to better results than were demonstrated in the previous phase trial 
in addition  safety or tolerability concerns may arise which limit our ability to deliver higher doses of the il trap to patients 
the dose levels that will be tested are substantially higher than the dose levels of other biological therapeutics currently approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 
the higher doses may affect the safety and or tolerability of the il trap  which may limit its commercial potential if the product candidate is ever approved for marketing and sale 
we intend to study our lead product candidates  the vegf trap and il trap  in a wide variety of indications in so called proof of concept studies 
we intend to study the vegf trap in a variety of cancer settings and ophthalmologic indications and the il trap in a wide variety of inflammatory disorders 
the specific indications were selected based on available pre clinical and clinical data from medical publications  our product candidates  and competitive agents 
the purpose of these exploratory proof of concept studies is to identify what diseases  if any  are best suited for treatment with these product candidates 
however  it is likely that our product candidates will not demonstrate the requisite efficacy and or safety profile to support continued development for most of the indications that are to be studied in these proof of concepts studies 
in fact  our product candidates may not demonstrate the requisite efficacy and safety profile to support the continued development for any of the indications studied in these early stage trials 
regulatory and litigation risks if we do not obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates  we will not be able to market or sell them 
we cannot sell or market products without regulatory approval 
if we do not obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our product candidates  the value of our company and our results of operations will be harmed 
in the united states  we must obtain and maintain approval from the united states food and drug administration fda for each drug we intend to sell 
obtaining fda approval is typically a lengthy and expensive process  and approval is highly uncertain 
foreign governments also regulate drugs distributed in their country and approval in any country is likely to be a lengthy and expensive process  and approval is highly uncertain 
none of our product candidates has ever received regulatory approval to be marketed and sold in the united states or any other country 
we may never receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates 
if the testing or use of our products harms people  we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims 
we could also face costly and damaging claims arising from employment law  securities law  environmental law or other applicable laws governing our operations 
the testing  manufacturing  marketing  and sale of drugs for use in people expose us to product liability risk 
we are currently involved in a product liability lawsuit brought by a subject who participated in a clinical trial of one of our drug candidates 
any informed consent or waivers obtained from people who sign up for our clinical trials may not protect us from liability or the cost of litigation 
our product liability insurance may not cover all potential liabilities or may not completely cover any liability arising from any such litigation 
moreover  we may not have access to liability insurance or be able to maintain our insurance on acceptable terms 

table of contents in may  purported class action securities lawsuits were commenced against us and certain of our officers and directors in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
a consolidated amended class action complaint was filed in october the complaint  which purports to be brought on behalf of a class consisting of investors in our publicly traded securities between march  and march   alleges that the defendants misstated or omitted material information concerning the safety and efficacy of axokine  in violation of sections b and a of the securities and exchange act of and rule b promulgated thereunder 
damages are sought in an unspecified amount 
on february   the united states district court of the southern district for new york denied our motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint 
we believe the lawsuit is without merit and intend to continue to defend the action vigorously 
because we do not believe that a loss is probable  no legal reserve has been established 
however  we cannot assure investors that we will be successful in defending this action  or that the amount of any settlement or judgment in this action will not exceed the coverage limits of our director and officers liability insurance policies 
if we are not successful in defending this action  our business and financial condition could be adversely affected 
in addition  whether or not we are successful  the defense of this action may divert attention of our management and other resources that would otherwise be engaged in running our business 
our operations may involve hazardous materials and are subject to environmental  health  and safety laws and regulations 
we may incur substantial liability arising from our activities involving the use of hazardous materials 
as a biopharmaceutical company with significant manufacturing operations  we are subject to extensive environmental  health  and safety laws and regulations  including those governing the use of hazardous materials 
our research and development and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of chemicals  viruses  radioactive compounds  and other hazardous materials 
the cost of compliance with environmental  health  and safety regulations is substantial 
if an accident involving these materials or an environmental discharge were to occur  we could be held liable for any resulting damages  or face regulatory actions  which could exceed our resources or insurance coverage 
risks related to our dependence on third parties on february   novartis pharma ag provided notice to us that they would not participate in the continued development and commercialization of the il trap under our collaboration agreement 
this may harm our ability to develop and commercialize the il trap 
we relied heavily on novartis to provide their expertise  resources  funding  manufacturing capacity  clinical expertise  and commercial infrastructure to support the il trap program 
novartis decision to withdraw from participating in the development and commercialization of the il trap may delay or disrupt the il trap program 
we do not have the resources and skills to replace those of novartis  which could result in significant delays in the development and potential commercialization of the il trap 
in addition  we will have to fund the development and commercialization of the il trap without novartis long term commitment  which will require substantially greater expenditures on our part 
if our collaboration with sanofi aventis for the vegf trap is terminated  our business operations and our ability to develop  manufacture  and commercialize the vegf trap in the time expected  or at all  would be harmed 
we rely heavily on sanofi aventis to assist with the development of the vegf trap 
if the vegf trap program continues  we will rely on sanofi aventis to assist with funding the vegf trap program  providing commercial manufacturing capacity  enrolling and monitoring clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approval  particularly outside the united states  and providing sales and marketing support 
while we cannot assure you that the vegf trap will ever be successfully developed and commercialized  if sanofi aventis does not perform its obligations in a timely manner  or at all  our ability to develop  manufacture  and commercialize the vegf trap will be significantly adversely affected 
sanofi aventis has the right to terminate its collaboration agreement with us at any time 
if sanofi aventis were to terminate its collaboration agreement 
table of contents with us  we might not have the resources or skills to replace those of our partner  which could cause significant delays in the development and or manufacture of the vegf trap and result in substantial additional costs to us 
we have no sales  marketing or distribution capabilities and would have to develop or outsource these capabilities 
termination of the sanofi aventis collaboration agreement would create new and additional risks to the successful development of the vegf trap 
our collaborators and service providers may fail to perform adequately in their efforts to support the development  manufacture  and commercialization of our drug candidates 
we depend upon third party collaborators  including sanofi aventis and service providers such as clinical research organizations  outside testing laboratories  clinical investigator sites  and third party manufacturers and product packagers and labelers  to assist us in the development of our product candidates 
if any of our existing collaborators or service providers breaches or terminates its agreement with us or does not perform its development or manufacturing services under an agreement in a timely manner or at all  we would experience additional costs  delays  and difficulties in the development or ultimate commercialization of our product candidates 
risks related to the manufacture of our product candidates we have limited manufacturing capacity  which could inhibit our ability to successfully develop or commercialize our drugs 
before approving a new drug or biologic product  the fda requires that the facilities at which the product will be manufactured be in compliance with current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp requirements 
manufacturing product candidates in compliance with these regulatory requirements is complex  time consuming  and expensive 
to be successful  our products must be manufactured for development  following approval  in commercial quantities  in compliance with regulatory requirements  and at competitive costs 
if we or any of our product collaborators or third party manufacturers  fillers or labelers are unable to maintain regulatory compliance  the fda can impose regulatory sanctions  including  among other things  refusal to approve a pending application for a new drug or biologic product  or revocation of a pre existing approval 
as a result  our business  financial condition  and results of operations may be materially harmed 
our manufacturing facility is likely to be inadequate to produce sufficient quantities of product for commercial sale 
we intend to rely on our corporate collaborators  as well as contract manufacturers  to produce the large quantities of drug material needed for commercialization of our products 
we rely entirely on third party manufacturers for filling and finishing services 
we will have to depend on these manufacturers to deliver material on a timely basis and to comply with regulatory requirements 
if we are unable to supply sufficient material on acceptable terms  or if we should encounter delays or difficulties in our relationships with our corporate collaborators or contract manufacturers  our business  financial condition  and results of operations may be materially harmed 
we may expand our own manufacturing capacity to support commercial production of active pharmaceutical ingredients  or api  for our product candidates 
this will require substantial additional funds  and we will need to hire and train significant numbers of employees and managerial personnel to staff our facility 
start up costs can be large and scale up entails significant risks related to process development and manufacturing yields 
we may be unable to develop manufacturing facilities that are sufficient to produce drug material for clinical trials or commercial use 
in addition  we may be unable to secure adequate filling and finishing services to support our products 
as a result  our business  financial condition  and results of operations may be materially harmed 
we may be unable to obtain key raw materials and supplies for the manufacture of our product candidates 
in addition  we may face difficulties in developing or acquiring production technology and managerial personnel to manufacture sufficient quantities of our product candidates at reasonable costs and in compliance with applicable quality assurance and environmental regulations and governmental permitting requirements 

table of contents if any of our clinical programs are discontinued  we may face costs related to the unused capacity at our manufacturing facilities 
we have large scale manufacturing operations in rensselaer  new york 
under a long term manufacturing agreement with merck  which expires in october unless extended for one additional year by merck  we produce an intermediate for a merck pediatric vaccine at our facility in rensselaer  new york 
we also use our facilities to produce api for our own clinical and preclinical candidates 
if we no longer use our facilities to manufacture the merck intermediate or clinical candidates are discontinued  we would have to absorb overhead costs and inefficiencies 
certain of our raw materials are single sourced from third parties  third party supply failures could adversely affect our ability to supply our products 
certain raw materials necessary for manufacturing and formulation of our product candidates are provided by single source unaffiliated third party suppliers 
we would be unable to obtain these raw materials for an indeterminate period of time if these third party single source suppliers were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these materials or products to us for any reason  including due to regulatory requirements or action  due to adverse financial developments at or affecting the supplier or due to labor shortages or disputes 
this  in turn  could materially and adversely affect our ability to manufacture our product candidates for use in clinical trials  which could materially and adversely affect our business and future prospects 
also  certain of the raw materials required in the manufacturing and the formulation of our clinical candidates may be derived from biological sources  including mammalian tissues  bovine serum  and human serum albumin 
there are certain european regulatory restrictions on using these biological source materials 
if we are required to substitute these sources to comply with european regulatory requirements  our clinical development activities may be delayed or interrupted 
risks related to commercialization of products if we are unable to establish sales  marketing  and distribution capabilities  or enter into agreements with third parties to do so  we will be unable to successfully market and sell future products 
we have no sales or distribution personnel or capabilities and have only a small staff with marketing capabilities 
if we are unable to obtain those capabilities  either by developing our own organizations or entering into agreements with service providers  we will not be able to successfully sell any products that we may obtain regulatory approval for and bring to market in the future 
in that event  we will not be able to generate significant revenue  even if our product candidates are approved 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to hire the qualified sales and marketing personnel we need or that we will be able to enter into marketing or distribution agreements with third party providers on acceptable terms  if at all 
under the terms of our collaboration agreement with sanofi aventis  we currently rely on sanofi aventis for sales  marketing  and distribution of the vegf trap  should it be approved in the future by regulatory authorities for marketing 
we will have to rely on a third party or devote significant resources to develop our own sales  marketing  and distribution capabilities for our other product candidates  and we may be unsuccessful in developing our own sales  marketing  and distribution organization 
we may be unable to formulate or manufacture our product candidates in a way that is suitable for clinical or commercial use 
changes in product formulations and manufacturing processes may be required as product candidates progress in clinical development and are ultimately commercialized 
if we are unable to develop suitable product formulations or manufacturing processes to support large scale clinical testing of our product candidates  including the vegf trap  il trap  and il trap  we may be unable to supply necessary materials for our clinical trials  which would delay the development of our product candidates 
similarly  if we are unable to supply sufficient quantities of our product or develop product formulations suitable for commercial use  we will not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates 
for example  we 
table of contents are in the process of developing formulations that would allow delivery of higher doses of the il trap to test in clinical trials 
the dose levels that will be tested are substantially higher than the dose levels of other biological therapeutics currently approved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 
separate new formulations will be used for subcutaneous and intravenous administration of the higher dose therapeutic 
if we are unable to develop or manufacture such a higher dose formulation that can be produced in a cost effective manner  potential future il trap sales and profitability may be limited 
even if our product candidates are ever approved  their commercial success is highly uncertain because our competitors may get to the marketplace before we do with better or lower cost drugs or the market for our product candidates may be too small to support commercialization or sufficient profitability 
there is substantial competition in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries from pharmaceutical  biotechnology  and chemical companies 
many of our competitors have substantially greater research  preclinical and clinical product development and manufacturing capabilities  and financial  marketing  and human resources than we do 
our smaller competitors may also enhance their competitive position if they acquire or discover patentable inventions  form collaborative arrangements or merge with large pharmaceutical companies 
even if we achieve product commercialization  our competitors have achieved  and may continue to achieve  product commercialization before our products are approved for marketing and sale 
genentech has an approved vegf antagonist on the market for treating certain cancers and many different pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are working to develop competing vegf antagonists  including novartis  eyetech pharmaceuticals  and pfizer 
many of these molecules are further along in development than the vegf trap and may offer competitive advantages over our molecule 
novartis has an ongoing phase clinical development program evaluating an orally delivered vegf tyrosine kinase in different cancer settings 
if this phase product candidate is safer and more efficacious than genentech s approved vegf antibody in these cancer settings  it will make it more difficult for us to successfully develop and commercialize the vegf trap 
the marketing approval for genentech s vegf antagonist  avastin tm  may make it more difficult for us to enroll patients in clinical trials to support the vegf trap and to obtain regulatory approval of the vegf trap in these cancer settings 
this may delay or impair our ability to successfully develop and commercialize the vegf trap 
in addition  even if the vegf trap is ever approved for sale for the treatment of certain cancers  it will be difficult for our drug to compete against avastin and  if approved by the fda  the novartis phase tyrosine kinase  because doctors and patients will have significant experience using these medicines 
the market for eye diseases is also very competitive 
eyetech pharmaceuticals and pfizer are marketing an approved vegf inhibitor for age related macular degeneration 
novartis and genentech are collaborating on another vegf inhibitor for the treatment of eye diseases that is in phase development 
the marketing approval of the eyetech pfizer vegf inhibitor and the potential approval of the novarits genentech vegf antibody makes it more difficult for us to successfully develop the vegf trap in eye diseases 
in addition  even if the vegf trap is ever approved for sale for the treatment of eye diseases  it will be difficult for our drug to compete against the eyetech pfizer drug and  if approved by the fda  the novartis genentech phase vegf antibody  because doctors and patients will have significant experience using these medicines 
the markets for both rheumatoid arthritis and asthma are both very competitive 
several highly successful medicines are available for these diseases 
examples include the tnf antagonists enbrel a registered trademark of amgen  remicade a registered trademark of centocor  and humira a registered trademark of abbott laboratories for rheumatoid arthritis  the il receptor antagonist kineret a registered trademark of amgen  and the leukotriene modifier singulair a registered trademark of merck  as well as various inexpensive corticosteroid medicines for asthma 
the availability of highly effective fda approved tnf antagonists and other marketed therapies makes it more difficult to successfully develop the il trap for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis  since it will be difficult to enroll patients with rheumatoid arthritis to participate in clinical trials of the il trap 
this may delay or impair our ability to successfully develop the drug candidate 
in addition  even if the il trap is ever approved for sale  it will be difficult for our drug to compete against these fda approved tnf antagonists because doctors and patients will have significant experience using these effective medicines 
moreover  these approved therapeutics may 
table of contents offer competitive advantages over the il trap  such as requiring fewer injections 
in addition  there are both small molecules and antibodies in development by third parties that are designed to block the synthesis of interleukin or inhibit the signaling of interleukin for example  vertex pharmaceuticals incorporated is developing an oral cytokine inhibitor of interleukin beta converting enzyme ice 
these drug candidates could offer competitive advantages over the il trap 
the successful development of these competing molecules could delay or impair our ability to successfully develop and commercialize the il trap 
we are developing the il trap for the treatment of a spectrum of rare diseases associated with mutations in the cias gene 
these rare genetic disorders affect a small group of people  estimated to be between several hundred and a few thousand 
there may be too few patients with these genetic disorders to profitably commercialize the il trap in this indication 
the successful commercialization of our product candidates will depend on obtaining coverage and reimbursement for use of these products from third party payors 
sales of biopharmaceutical products largely depend on the reimbursement of patients medical expenses by government health care programs and private health insurers 
without the financial support of the governments or third party payors  the market for any biopharmaceutical product will be limited 
these third party payors increasingly challenge the price and examine the cost effectiveness of products and services 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of any new therapeutic  particularly if there exist lower cost standards of care 
third party payors may not reimburse sales of our products  which would harm our business 
risk related to employees we are dependent on our key personnel and if we cannot recruit and retain leaders in our research  development  manufacturing  and commercial organizations  our business will be harmed 
we are highly dependent on our executive officers 
if we are not able to retain any of these persons or our chairman  our business may suffer 
in particular  we depend on the services of roy vagelos  md  the chairman of our board of directors  leonard schleifer  md  md  our president and chief executive officer  and george d 
yancopoulos  md  md  our executive vice president  chief scientific officer and president  regeneron research laboratories 
there is intense competition in the biotechnology industry for qualified scientists and managerial personnel in the development  manufacture  and commercialization of drugs 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for developing our business 
risks related to intellectual property if we cannot protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets or our patents are insufficient to protect our proprietary rights  our business and competitive position will be harmed 
our business requires using sensitive and proprietary technology and other information that we protect as trade secrets 
we seek to prevent improper disclosure of these trade secrets through confidentiality agreements 
if our trade secrets are improperly exposed  either by our own employees or our collaborators  it would help our competitors and adversely affect our business 
we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
the patent position of biotechnology companies involves complex legal and factual questions and  therefore  enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty 
our patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
patent applications filed outside the united states may be challenged by third parties who file an opposition 
such opposition proceedings are increasingly common in the european union and are costly to defend 
we have patent applications that are being opposed and it is likely that we will need to defend additional patent applications in the future 
our patent rights may not provide us with a proprietary position or competitive advantages against competitors 
furthermore  even if the outcome is favorable to us  the enforcement of our intellectual property rights can be expensive and time consuming 

table of contents we may be restricted in our development and or commercialization activities by third party patents 
our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties 
other parties may allege that they have blocking patents to our trap products in clinical development  either because they claim to hold proprietary rights to fusion proteins or proprietary rights to components of the trap or the way it is manufactured 
we are aware of certain united states and foreign patents relating to particular il and il receptors 
our il trap includes portions of the il and il receptors 
in addition  we are aware of a broad patent held by genentech relating to proteins fused to certain immunoglobulin domains 
our trap product candidates include proteins fused to immunoglobulin domains 
although we do not believe that we are infringing valid and enforceable third party patents  the holders of these patents may sue us for infringement and a court may find that we are infringing one or more validly issued patents  which may materially harm our business 
any patent holders could sue us for damages and seek to prevent us from manufacturing  selling or developing our drug candidates  and a court may find that we are infringing validly issued patents of third parties 
in the event that the manufacture  use or sale of any of our clinical candidates infringes on the patents or violates other proprietary rights of third parties  we may be prevented from pursuing product development  manufacturing  and commercialization of our drugs and may be required to pay costly damages 
such a result may materially harm our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
legal disputes are likely to be costly and time consuming to defend 
we seek to obtain licenses to patents when  in our judgment  such licenses are needed 
if any licenses are required  we may not be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
the failure to obtain any such license could prevent us from developing or commercializing any one or more of our product candidates  which could severely harm our business 
risks related to our common stock our stock price is extremely volatile 
there has been significant volatility in our stock price and generally in the market prices of biotechnology companies securities 
various factors and events may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
these factors include  by way of example progress  delays or adverse results in clinical trials  announcement of technological innovations or product candidates by us or competitors  fluctuations in our operating results  public concern as to the safety or effectiveness of our product candidates  developments in our relationship with collaborative partners  developments in the biotechnology industry or in government regulation of healthcare  large sales of our common stock by our executive officers  directors or significant shareholders  arrivals and departures of key personnel  and general market conditions 
the trading price of our common stock has been  and could continue to be  subject to wide fluctuations in response to these and other factors  including the sale or attempted sale of a large amount of our common stock in the market 
broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

table of contents future sales of our common stock by our significant shareholders or us may depress our stock price and impair our ability to raise funds in new share offerings 
a small number of our shareholders beneficially own a substantial amount of our common stock 
as of february   our seven largest shareholders  which include sanofi aventis and novartis  beneficially owned of our outstanding shares of common stock and class a stock  assuming  in the case of leonard s 
schleifer  md  ph 
d  our chief executive officer  the exercise of all options held by him which are exercisable within days of february  as of that date  novartis owned  shares of common stock  representing approximately of the shares of common stock and class a stock then outstanding 
under our registration rights agreement with novartis  these shares of common stock may generally not be sold or otherwise transferred by novartis until after march  commencing after march   novartis has certain registration rights with respect to these shares 
as of february   sanofi aventis owned  shares of common stock  representing approximately of the shares of common stock and class a stock then outstanding 
under our stock purchase agreement with sanofi aventis  these shares may generally not be sold or otherwise transferred until after september   and for one year after that date  sanofi aventis may sell no more than  shares in any calendar quarter 
after september   sanofi aventis may sell no more than  shares in any calendar quarter 
accordingly  in and thereafter  as the restrictions on transfer applicable to the shares of common stock owned by novartis and sanofi aventis expire  these shares will be freely tradeable in the public market  subject  in the case of sanofi aventis  to the foregoing continuing contractual sales volume restrictions 
if novartis or sanofi aventis  or our other significant shareholders or we  sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales may occur exists  the market price of our common stock could fall 
sales of common stock by our significant shareholders  including sanofi aventis and novartis  also might make it more difficult for us to raise funds by selling equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
our existing shareholders may be able to exert significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval 
holders of class a stock  who are the shareholders who purchased their stock from us before our initial public offering  are entitled to ten votes per share  while holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share 
as of february   holders of class a stock held of all shares of common stock and class a stock then outstanding  and had of the combined voting power of all shares of common stock and class a stock 
these shareholders  if acting together  would be in a position to significantly influence the election of our directors and to effect or prevent certain corporate transactions that require majority or supermajority approval of the combined classes  including mergers and other business combinations 
this may result in our company taking corporate actions that you may not consider to be in your best interest and may affect the price of our common stock 
as of february  our current officers and directors beneficially owned of our outstanding shares of common stock and class a stock and of the combined voting power of our shares of common stock and class a stock  assuming the exercise of all options held by such persons which are exercisable within days of february   and our seven largest shareholders beneficially owned of our outstanding shares of common stock and class a stock and of the combined voting power of our shares of common stock and class a stock  assuming  in the case of leonard s 
schleifer  md  ph 
d  our chief executive officer  the exercise of all options held by him which are exercisable within days of february  the anti takeover effects of provisions of our charter  by laws and our rights agreement  and of new york corporate law  could deter  delay or prevent an acquisition or other change in control of us and could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  our by laws  our rights agreement and the new york business corporation law contain various provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing 
table of contents a change in control of our company or our management that shareholders may consider favorable or beneficial 
some of these provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other shareholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
these provisions include authorization to issue blank check preferred stock  which is preferred stock that can be created and issued by the board of directors without prior shareholder approval  with rights senior to those of our common shareholders  a staggered board of directors  so that it would take three successive annual meetings to replace all of our directors  a requirement that removal of directors may only be effected for cause and only upon the affirmative vote of at least eighty percent of the outstanding shares entitled to vote for directors  as well as a requirement that any vacancy on the board of directors may be filled only by the remaining directors  any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of shareholders may be taken without a meeting  only if  prior to such action  all of our shareholders consent  the effect of which is to require that shareholder action may only be taken at a duly convened meeting  any shareholder seeking to bring business before an annual meeting of shareholders must provide timely notice of this intention in writing and meet various other requirements  and under the new york business corporation law  a plan of merger or consolidation of the company must be approved by of the votes of all outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon 
see the risk factor immediately above captioned our existing shareholders may be able to exert significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval 
we have a shareholder rights plan which could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the support of our board of directors and principal shareholders 
in addition  many of our stock options issued under our long term incentive plan may become fully vested in connection with a change in control of the company  as defined in the plan 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates primarily from our investment of available cash balances in investment grade corporate and us government securities 
we do not believe we are materially exposed to changes in interest rates 
under our current policies we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we estimated that a one percent change in interest rates would result in an approximately million change in the fair market value of our investment portfolio at both december  and
