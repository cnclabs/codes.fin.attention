i part i item business overview we are a pharmaceutical company that develops  manufactures and commercializes generic versions of controlled release  niche and immediate release pharmaceutical products  including oral contraceptives  and distributes pharmaceuticals  primarily generics  which have been commercialized by others  as well as our own  primarily to independent pharmacies  pharmacy chains  pharmacy buying groups and physicians offices 
our controlled release pharmaceutical products use our proprietary controlled release drug delivery technologies 
controlled release pharmaceutical products generally provide more consistent drug levels in the bloodstream than immediate release dosage forms and may improve drug efficacy and reduce side effects  by releasing drug dosages at specific times and in specific locations in the gastrointestinal tract of the body 
they also provide patient friendly dosage forms that reduce the number of times a drug must be taken  thus improving patient compliance 
we also commercialize brand pharmaceuticals that  in some instances  use our proprietary controlled release drug delivery technologies 
on march   we entered into agreements with first horizon pharmaceutical corporation for the sale and licensing of certain rights and assets related to our two main brand products  altoprev and fortamet 
the closing of the transaction  which is subject to certain customary conditions including clearance under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act  is expected to occur by may business strategy we are focusing our efforts on our core competencies of formulation development of generic versions of controlled release and other pharmaceutical products as well as the sales  marketing and distribution of both our own and others generic pharmaceuticals 
we intend to grow through both internal and external efforts  such as strategic alliances  collaborative agreements and acquisitions 
we continue to seek agreements with third parties that will leverage our formulation capabilities and our controlled release technologies  including but not limited to agreements to develop combination and other products 
research and development our research and development efforts are focused on developing generic products using our proprietary controlled release drug delivery technologies  as well as niche and immediate release products  including oral contraceptives 
we also continue to develop a brand product combining takeda chemical industries  ltd 
s actos pioglitizone and our extended release metformin product 
total research and development expenses were approximately million  million and million  in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that research and development expenses will total approximately million during our level of research and development spending will be periodically evaluated during to take into consideration  among other things  our level of profitability and cash flows 
the expenses associated with generic research and development are primarily costs relating to personnel  overhead  laboratories for conducting bioequivalence studies and raw materials used in developing our products 
we incurred significant levels of research and development expenses for brand products through  but curtailed our brand product research and development in the latter part of the expenses associated with those brand research and development were primarily for costs related to personnel  overhead  professional services  filing fees and laboratory services  clinical investigators and clinical research organizations responsible for conducting the clinical trials required to support a product application with the food and drug administration fda and preparing new drug applications ndas 
strategic alliances  collaborative agreements and dispositions we intend to consider and  as appropriate  enter into strategic alliances and collaborative agreements with other companies to  among other things  license or acquire rights to generic products or product candidates  and possibly to acquire complementary businesses 
we also intend to divest ourselves of products or businesses that are no longer a strategic fit to our business strategy 
generic pharmaceuticals generic pharmaceutical products contain the same active pharmaceutical ingredient as the brand product they are allowed to be substituted for  and otherwise mimic the physiological characteristics of that brand product 
we have historically focused on developing generic versions of controlled release  patent protected brand pharmaceuticals  using our controlled release technologies and formulation techniques to develop products that do not infringe the patents protecting the brand product 
over the past several years  we have broadened our generic business strategy to include the research and development of immediate release and niche pharmaceuticals  including oral contraceptives  and to enter into collaborative agreements with other companies to  among other things  license or acquire rights to their generic products or product candidates 
in connection with our generic products  we generally conduct studies to establish that our product is bioequivalent to the brand product  and obtain legal advice that our product does not infringe the patents of the nda owner or the innovator  or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable and or have expired 
fda approval is required before a generic version of a previously approved brand pharmaceutical product or certain new dosage forms of an existing product can be marketed 
approval for such products generally is sought using an abbreviated new drug application anda 
in most cases  bioavailability and bioequivalence studies are required in support of an anda 
bioavailability indicates the rate of absorption and levels of concentration of a drug in the blood stream 
bioequivalence compares the bioavailability of one drug product with another and  when established  indicates that the rate of absorption and levels of concentration in the body are substantially equivalent to the previously approved reference listed drug 
an anda may be submitted for a drug product on the basis that it is the equivalent of a previously approved pharmaceutical product or  in the case of a new dosage form  that it is suitable for use for the indications specified without the need to conduct additional safety or efficacy testing 
as further detailed below  the law provides a complex  time consuming and litigious process for gaining approval to market generic versions of brand products that are covered by existing patents see regulation pharmaceuticals anda process generic pharmaceuticals for a description of this regulatory process and patent infringement litigation for a discussion of the pending litigation involving our anda products 
if the anda applicant is the first to successfully file an application for a patent protected product and provides the appropriate patent certification notice to the fda  the nda holder and the patent holder  the applicant may be awarded a day period of marketing exclusivity against other companies that subsequently file andas for that same product 
however  during such period of marketing exclusivity  the brand company or its licensee  or both  may market the brand product using a generic label  which is commonly referred to as an authorized generic 
other approved generic products can immediately come to market if this exclusivity period is not awarded or  if awarded  the marketing exclusivity period has expired 
we believe this day period of marketing exclusivity provides an opportunity for the recipient to build market share  to better defend that market share against competition that will arise when the exclusivity period expires  to realize greater gross profit  and in some cases  to gain value by relinquishing or transferring its marketing exclusivity right to others 
the ability to secure the benefit of this exclusivity period  and the extent of the benefit it confers  is dependent upon a variety of factors  some beyond the anda applicant s control  including whether the brand product will also be marketed as an authorized generic  either before or during such exclusivity period  the date in which its anda was filed  and consequently  the law pertaining to its anda and its exclusivity period  and the speed and results of litigation involving other anda filers see regulation pharmaceuticals anda process generic pharmaceuticals

our generic versions of cardizem cd and  to a lesser extent  tiazac  claritin d  claritin reditabs and glucotrol xl account for a substantial portion of the revenues and profits we presently derive from our generic product portfolio 
see risk factors 
our andas for generic versions of accupril  biaxin xl  claritin d  monopril and monopril hct have received fda approval 
for various reasons  as of march   we have not commenced the sale of these products 
we continue to work to expand our generic product line 
in  we received final product approvals and two tentative approvals  launched nine generic products  two of which were in licensed from affiliates of genpharm inc  and submitted andas to the fda  some of which we believe may have been the first filed andas for such product 
the fda issues a tentative approval when it has determined that the anda is approvable  but there is a patent or exclusivity period prohibiting it from granting final approval 
we currently have approximately andas pending at the fda 
for various reasons  we generally do not publicly comment on the identity  or approval  launch or litigation status of the products that are the subject of our pending andas 
disclosure of the names of our anda products could cause our competitors to also develop such products or to pursue various strategies to delay or avoid generic competition from our product 
disclosure of the approval or litigation status or the probable timing of the approval of our pending andas or the launch of our products is inherently uncertain  and any indications we receive are preliminary and  therefore  subject to change 
actual results sometimes differ from our expectations and we believe that disclosure of our expectations with respect to the approval  launch or litigation status of our anda filings could create unrealistic expectations among investors 
however  from time to time the identity of some of our pending anda products may become publicly known as a result of  among other things  the initiation of patent infringement litigation against us with respect to the product or the inclusion of such product on various formularies 
our disclosed andas currently pending approval at the fda include our generic versions of toprol xl mg  for which we believe we will be entitled to a day period of marketing exclusivity  toprol xl mg  mg and mg  concerta  wellbutrin sr  zyban  and certain oral contraceptive products  including ortho novum and ortho novum our generic products are generally sold through our internal sales team under the andrx pharmaceuticals  inc label primarily to warehousing pharmacy chains  wholesalers  large managed care customers and selected government agencies 
while there were no sales to a single customer that represented of andrx corporation s consolidated net revenues  the top customers in our generic segment represent approximately of the segment s revenues 
since this distribution network has undergone consolidation  marked by the growth of a few large retail drug store chains  securing and maintaining customers for generic products is highly competitive  and significant price erosion often results when competitors attempt to gain market share from each other 
in addition to these customers  we sell our generic products through our distribution operations directly to independent pharmacies  pharmacy chains  buying groups and physicians offices 
generic product pipeline we are continually evaluating potential generic product candidates 
as part of this evaluation process  we look for brand products that we can formulate as generics and review the pharmaceutical patents associated with such products to determine whether we can challenge those patents as being invalid or not infringed by the application of our technologies or know how 
though the majority of such products have historically been controlled release products  we also develop certain niche and immediate release pharmaceutical products  including oral contraceptives 
collaborative agreements and strategic alliances we intend to consider and  as appropriate  enter into collaborative agreements and strategic alliances with other companies to  among other things  license or acquire rights to generic products or product candidates  to collaborate on the formulation of brand products employing our controlled release technologies  to acquire complementary businesses and to achieve other business objectives 
we also intend to consider and  as appropriate  enter into collaborative agreements and strategic alliances with other companies to  among other things  manufacture  market or sell our generic products or product candidates 
the following are examples of these types of collaborative agreements our march agreement to market in the united states all four strengths of genpharm inc s generic version of paxil 
our june agreement with martec pharmaceutical  inc whereby martec will supply its generic version of procardia xl mg tablets to us and we will market the product in the united states 
under the terms of the arrangement  the parties share the net profits  as defined  from product sales 
our september agreement with ranbaxy pharmaceuticals inc in which we transferred to ranbaxy the remaining portion of our day period of market exclusivity for a generic version of monopril hct in exchange for a share of ranbaxy s profits from the sale of this product for a period of time 
our october agreement to market in the united states the mg and mg strengths of genpharm s generic version of pletal 
our january agreement with perrigo company providing for our manufacture and supply to perrigo of our generic versions of claritin d  claritin reditabs and claritin d  as store brand otc products 
this agreement followed the fda s determination that the claritin line of products should be sold as otc products  and not as prescription pharmaceuticals 
our july agreement with impax laboratories  inc and teva pharmaceuticals curacao  nv pertaining to the respective andas for generic versions of wellbutrin sr and zyban 
in march and may  we relinquished our rights to the day period of market exclusivity for generic wellbutrin sr mg and generic zyban  respectively  allowing impax and other companies to gain fda approval to market their products 
teva launched impax s generic wellbutrin sr product in the first quarter of and impax s generic zyban product in the second quarter of  and we were entitled to a share of the profits  as defined  derived from teva s sale of such products for a day period 
our share of profits from sales of generic wellbutrin sr mg ended in september and our share of profits from sales of generic zyban expired in november our september agreement resolving patent infringement litigation with pfizer inc and alza corporation concerning our andas for the mg  mg and mg strengths of glucotrol xl 
pursuant to this agreement  the lawsuits were dismissed and we received the right to either market the glucotrol xl product including any strength thereof supplied by pfizer as an authorized generic and or to manufacture and market our anda product s in exchange for a royalty pursuant to a sublicense for relevant alza patents 
though we launched all three strengths of glucotrol xl  supplied by pfizer  in december  we continue to work toward gaining fda approval to launch our own versions of this product 
our october agreement where we sold our massachusetts aerosol manufacturing operation to amphastar pharmaceuticals  inc  a california based generic and specialty pharmaceutical company and agreed  under certain circumstances  to continue to purchase certain minimum quantities of albuterol mdi for at least one year  which we renewed for another two years in november our december agreement with teva pharmaceuticals providing for our formulation  submission to the fda and manufacture of certain oral contraceptive products to be marketed in both the united states and canada by teva as part of its larger product line of oral contraceptives 
our december agreement to co develop and manufacture a combination brand product consisting of takeda chemical industries  ltd 
s actos pioglitazone and our extended release metformin  each of which products is administered once a day for the treatment of type diabetes 
our october agreement in which genpharm and we relinquished our shared marketing exclusivity rights to the generic versions of the mg and mg strengths of prilosec  and accelerated the ability of kudco to receive fda approval of the sale of its product 
though the amount was higher in the past  this agreement gives us of kudco s net profits  as defined  from the sale of kudco s product  which will continue until approximately february customer arrangements consistent with generic industry practice  we have a return policy that allows customers to return our products within a specified period both prior and subsequent to the product s expiration date 
if we reduce the selling price of our product  we may also provide inventory credits  known as shelf stock adjustments  to our customers in an amount approximating the decrease in the value of the inventory owned by our customers as of the date of that price reduction 
we also have indirect customer arrangements whereby chain pharmacies and certain other customers purchase our products at prices negotiated with us  but obtain those products through wholesalers they independently select  and agreements with certain wholesalers to establish contract pricing for certain products that the wholesaler will agree to place in their preferential pricing program 
under either form of arrangement  we will provide the wholesaler or customer with a credit  known as a chargeback  for an amount equal to the difference between our agreed upon contract price and the price we previously invoiced to the wholesaler 
see critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition 
we have from time to time entered into long term supply agreements with certain customers related to our generic products 
joint ventures we have established two unconsolidated joint ventures for the commercialization of generic products  including caran  which is a joint venture with carlsbad technologies  inc through this joint venture  carlsbad developed and manufactures generic versions of pepcid  prozac and mevacor  which we are currently selling under the andrx pharmaceuticals  inc label  and ancirc  which is a joint venture with watson pharmaceuticals  inc for the development  manufacture and sale of certain generic products 
we are currently selling one ancirc product  a generic version of oruvail  for which we share profits equally with watson 
in november  we became solely responsible for all of the additional costs to develop  manufacture and sell the six remaining ancirc products  and watson became entitled  under certain conditions  to a royalty on the net sales we derive from the commercialization of those products  including our generic versions of glucotrol xl 
other than glucotrol xl  we have discontinued our development efforts with respect to the ancirc products 
pharmaceutical distribution operations through our distribution business  which consists of our anda  anda pharmaceuticals and valmed also known as vip subsidiaries  we distribute predominantly generic pharmaceutical products and certain brand pharmaceuticals  nutritional products and medical office products 
while most of the shelf keeping units skus in our distribution operations are for products commercialized by unrelated entities  we also utilize these operations for the sale and marketing of our  and our collaborative partners  generic products 
we believe that our distribution operations are a valuable resource in the national distribution of generic pharmaceuticals 
our distribution operations offer next day delivery  competitive pricing  and responsive customer service for more than  skus  which we believe are the critical elements to competing effectively in this market 
we purchase these products from approximately vendors  no one of whom accounts for more than of our skus or dollar volume  and market them primarily to independent pharmacies  pharmacy chains  pharmacy buying groups and physicians offices 
we sell and receive orders for these products through both telemarketing and electronic means 
our telemarketing staff is comprised of approximately persons  as well as sales executives responsible for national accounts 
these telemarketers initiate approximately  phone calls per week to approximately  active accounts throughout the united states and puerto rico from our south florida and grand island  new york offices 
our internally developed  proprietary internet ordering systems  andanet  andameds and vippharm  as well as our hand held palm ordering devices  andaconnect and vipconnect  also allow our customers to place their orders electronically 
during  approximately of sales were generated through our order entry internet sites  and approximately of sales were generated through andaconnect and vipconnect 
these amounts were approximately and  respectively in we are seeking to further leverage our distribution operations by dedicating a portion of our telemarketing staff and warehouses to other synergistic business to business opportunities 
as an example  we are seeking to provide non warehousing customers with a virtual warehouse service that will allow these customers to use our warehousing and distribution capabilities to ship and store their products 
we believe that this virtual warehouse will allow us to provide operational benefits to these customers and will result in an expansion of our relationship with them 
we presently distribute products from our facilities in weston  florida and columbus  ohio 
for the year ended december   approximately half of our distribution sales were shipped from each of these facilities  though this percentage can vary 
our ohio distribution center provides us with additional distribution opportunities for the foreseeable future 
brand pharmaceuticals we currently sell brand products under the andrx laboratories  inc label 
these sales are made primarily to wholesalers  warehousing pharmacy chains and pharmacy benefit managers pbms 
unlike generic products  which are generally substituted at the pharmacy  brand products need to generate demand through a sales force dedicated to describing to physicians the pharmaceutical characteristics of the product  as well as marketing materials 
the cost of maintaining a sales force and promoting a brand pharmaceutical product is substantial 
in our brand business  there are a limited number of large customers 
these customers may attempt to modify the terms by which we have historically done business  such as through the imposition of service fees and or additional concessions 
during the years ended december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of our brand product shipments were made to four customers 
as of march   our principal brand products are altoprev and fortamet  two internally developed extended release products that we market through approximately primary care sales representatives in approximately territories 
our brand business also has approximately marketing  regulatory  medical affairs and related personnel 
we anticipate continuing to operate our brand business unit until such time as we complete its sale or disposition 
on march   we entered into agreements with first horizon for the sale and licensing of certain rights and assets related to our fortamet and altoprev brand pharmaceutical products 
first horizon has agreed to pay us million for fortamet and up to million for altoprev 
the amount that we may receive from first horizon related to altoprev  if any  is contingent upon meeting and maintaining certain supply requirements  as defined 
we will also be entitled to receive royalties on net sales  as defined  of fortamet and altoprev of and  respectively 
we will retain our obligation to pay a royalty to sandoz related to fortamet subject to certain minimums and a maximum 
we have also entered into a long term manufacturing and supply arrangement for fortamet and altoprev with first horizon 
the closing of the transaction  which is subject to certain customary conditions including clearance under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act  is expected to occur by may after that closing occurs  we have agreed to provide certain transitional services to first horizon for a period of time 
in connection with this divestiture of our brand business  we estimate that we will incur personnel related expenses of approximately million  including severance  performance incentives and retention 
in addition  we estimate we will incur approximately million in other costs  including million in non cash charges 
we also sell  but do not actively market  the entex line of cough and cold products 
the continued commercial sale of our entex product line is subject to uncertainty as a result of the draft compliance policy guide issued by fda on october   pertaining to pharmaceutical products that are presently permitted to be on the market and sold without an approved anda or nda 
this draft guidance advises that  once fda approves a version of such product  unapproved drug products  such as our entex product line  may become subject to fda enforcement action 
even though the fda approved an nda for an otc product containing the same active ingredients as our entex pse prescription product in june  as of march   we have not received any indication of an enforcement action from the fda concerning our entex pse product see note to consolidated financial statements 
the contemplated brand business divestiture does not include the sale of the entex product rights  and this product line will continue to be sold as part of our generic business 
our proprietary controlled release drug delivery technologies certain of our pharmaceutical products both generic and brand utilize our proprietary controlled release drug delivery technologies to control the release characteristics of a variety of orally administered drugs 
controlled release products are formulations that gradually and predictably release active drug compounds in the gastrointestinal tract of the body over a to hour period and therefore need be taken only once or twice daily  as compared to immediate release products that have to be taken three to four times per day 
controlled release products typically provide benefits over immediate release drugs 
we have proprietary drug delivery technologies that have been patented for certain applications or for which we have filed for patent protection for certain applications 
these include pelletized pulsatile delivery system single composition osmotic tablet system solubility modulating hydrogel system delayed pulsatile hydrogel system stabilized pellet delivery system stabilized tablet delivery system granulated modulating hydrogel system pelletized tablet system porous tablet system modified antihistamine decongestant combination system pulsatile hydrogel system directly compressible hydrogel system modulating matrix system pulsatile enteric coating system pelletized delivery system patents and other intellectual property rights like others in the pharmaceutical industry  we place considerable importance on obtaining patent and trademark protection and otherwise preserving the confidentiality of our trade secrets and proprietary know how pertaining to our technologies  products and processes 
our general policy is to file patent applications and trademarks for our technologies  products and processes that we consider important to our business 
we hold numerous us and foreign patents and expect to continue to file us and foreign patent applications to protect our intellectual property 
as of december   we had patents issued  allowed or applied for in the us and internationally  and had exclusively licensed additional us and foreign patents and patent applications from others 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to obtain us patent protection for certain of our products  to preserve our trade secrets and proprietary rights  and to operate without infringing on the intellectual property rights of third parties or having third parties circumvent our rights 
we also seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know how through confidentiality agreements with our partners  employees and consultants 
it is possible that these agreements will be breached or will not be enforceable in every instance  and that we will not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
it is also possible that our trade secrets will otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors 
we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights  to protect our trade secrets or know how or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
litigation concerning patents  trademarks  copyrights and proprietary technologies can often be protracted and expensive and  as with litigation generally  the outcome is inherently uncertain 
raw materials the active chemical raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are generally available from multiple sources 
however  certain raw materials are available from limited sources  and our andas generally specify a particular single source for the active pharmaceutical ingredient 
we have at times experienced problems as a result of a lack of raw material availability 
such problems result from  among other things  a supplier s delay in providing raw materials  the closure of a particular source of raw materials  the unavailability of a replacement  and the shipment to us of raw materials that fail to meet our specifications 
in addition  since fda approval of raw material suppliers or product manufacturers is generally required in connection with each product  a significant delay in the manufacture or supply of that product could occur if raw materials or finished products from an approved supplier or manufacturer were to become unavailable 
manufacturing and quality we currently operate manufacturing facilities in florida totaling approximately  square feet  which are primarily used for the manufacture of controlled release and immediate release solid dosage products  as well as oral contraceptives 
an expansion is underway in our davie  florida facility to increase our manufacturing capacity 
though we anticipate that this expansion project will provide us with our required capacity through  additional expansion at that site is also possible 
we are also upgrading our high potency manufacturing operations at certain of our other facilities in south florida 
for certain of our products  we contract with third parties for the manufacture of the products  some of which are currently available only from that supplier 
we believe it is more likely than not that we will sell our  square foot manufacturing facility in morrisville  north carolina 
we sometimes file our anda or nda based on study results utilizing product batches that are smaller than what we anticipate may be required for the commercial launch of that product 
thus  in order to manufacture these products in sufficient quantities for commercial launch  we are required to scale up our manufacturing process for use on larger equipment  in accordance with fda regulations 
to meet the market demand for our current and anticipated products  and manufacture our products in compliance with our regulatory submissions and fda s current good manufacturing practices cgmp  we continue to focus on improving the efficiency and quality of our manufacturing operations 
these efforts include  among others i optimizing our processes  thereby reducing product rejections  ii implementing quality initiatives to ensure compliance with cgmp  including laboratory information management systems  iii increasing personnel training  accountability  development and expertise  iv implementing jd edwards enterprise resource planning erp system  an integrated planning and operating system  which we accomplished in early  v evaluating the commercial viability of producing certain products that we anticipate will generate a relatively small amount of profit compared to the utilization of resources in order to allow us to optimize our output and maximize our profitability  vi transferring production or portions thereof for certain products to equipment capable of handling larger batch sizes or to third parties  including foreign contract manufacturers  and vii renovating our facilities to increase capacity and optimize production 
until all of our efforts come to fruition  we will continue to incur significant costs related to inefficiencies and excess capacity at our manufacturing facilities and production related write offs 
our pharmaceutical manufacturing operations are required to comply with cgmp 
cgmp encompasses all aspects of the production process  including validation and record keeping  in addition to standards for facilities  equipment and personnel  and involves changing and evolving standards 
consequently  continuing compliance with cgmp can be a particularly difficult  extensive and expensive part of pharmaceutical manufacturing operations 
similar cgmp regulations and other requirements apply to products that we manufacture for sale in canada 
we are subject to regular inspections by the fda 
any non compliance with cgmp or the corrective action plan we proposed to the fda in response to the two form fda s issued by the fda in and the fda warning letter we received in august  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations see risk factors 
as a result of all of the foregoing factors  we may at times have difficulty fulfilling all of the market demand for our products and having pre launch quantities of our product candidates available when we obtain fda approval to market our products see risk factors 
information systems we have experienced significant growth in our operations  which has required the expansion  upgrading and improvement of our administrative  operational  and management systems  controls and resources 
to achieve this objective  in we began the implementation of an integrated enterprise resource planning erp suite of operational and financial systems  with the jd edwards enterprise one jde software package 
the objective of this initiative was to build an information systems platform to support our current and future operational needs as our business continues to grow 
in early  we successfully completed the jde implementation  as the systems portfolio has been deployed across all operating entities 
as a result  we believe we have achieved the following benefits automation of certain labor intensive administrative processes and activities  optimized manufacturing and distribution business processes  enhanced collaboration with electronic trading partners customers and suppliers  improved materials management usage and movement  enhanced performance management capabilities through improved accuracy and availability of information  and enhanced regulatory compliance 
in  andrx also began the implementation of the peoplesoft human resources and payroll system 
peoplesoft is an enterprise wide software package intended to enable us to better manage  optimize and leverage our employees and thereby achieve a higher level of business performance 
the payroll software modules were successfully implemented among our divisions in and the human resource modules were completed in we will continue to incur costs to support and modify these systems for our expanding or changing operations 
we also intend to enhance the information systems capabilities of our distribution operations and to invest further in new technology and systems to enhance customer and supplier relationships and internal capabilities and efficiencies 
regulation pharmaceuticals anda process generic pharmaceuticals in our generic operations  we apply our proprietary technology processes and formulations to develop a product that will reproduce the brand product s physiological characteristics ie  the rate and extent of absorption into the bloodstream  but not infringe the patents of the brand owner or other innovator of the nda 
in connection with this process  we conduct studies to establish that our product is bioequivalent to the brand product  and obtain legal advice that our product does not infringe the nda owner s or the innovator s patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable 
fda approval is required before a generic version of a previously approved drug or certain new dosage forms of an existing drug can be marketed 
approval for such products generally is sought using an anda 
in most cases  bioavailability and bioequivalence studies must be conducted in support of the anda and clinical studies are not required 
bioavailability indicates the rate of absorption and levels of concentration of a drug in the blood stream 
bioequivalence compares the bioavailability of one drug product with another and  when established  indicates that the rate of absorption and levels of concentration in the body are substantially equivalent to the previously approved reference listed drug 
an anda may be submitted for a drug product on the basis that it is bioequivalent to a previously approved drug product or  in the case of a new dosage form  that it is suitable for use for the indications specified without the need to conduct additional safety or efficacy testing 
the drug price competition and patent restoration act of  known as the hatch waxman amendments  require that we submit an anda to the fda for each generic product we seek to market 
the anda contains a substantial amount of information about the proposed product s formulation  ingredients  chemistry and manufacturing controls  stability and the bioavailability and bioequivalence studies conducted on such product  all of which is reviewed by the fda s office of generic drugs ogd 
in addition  the anda is required to contain the anda applicant s certification concerning each patent that has been listed for the reference brand product in the orange book 
if there is no patent listed in the orange book  the anda applicant so states by submitting what is referred to as a paragraph i certification 
if the patent listed in the orange book has expired  the anda applicant so states by submitting what is referred to as a paragraph ii certification 
if the anda applicant intends to wait until the expiration of the patent listed in the orange book before it intends to market its product  the anda applicant so states by submitting what is referred to as a paragraph iii certification 
and  if the anda applicant believes that the listed patent is invalid or unenforceable  or that its product does not infringe such patent s  the anda applicant so states by submitting what is referred to as a paragraph iv certification in its anda 
if a paragraph iv certification is made  the anda applicant must also send a notice containing its factual basis for its paragraph iv certification to the nda owner and any patent holder 
the nda owner or patent holder may then initiate a legal challenge against the anda applicant for patent infringement 
before the december amendments to hatch waxman were enacted  if the nda owner or patent holder asserted a patent challenge within days of their receipt of notice of the anda applicant s paragraph iv certification  fda was prevented from approving that anda until the earlier of months  the expiration of the patent  or when the infringement case concerning each such patent was favorably decided in an anda applicant s favor  or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court 
this prohibition is generally referred to as the month stay 
in some cases  nda owners and patent holders obtained additional patents for their products after an anda had been filed  but before that anda received final marketing approval  and then initiated a new patent challenge  which resulted in more than one month stay 
the december amendments to hatch waxman were intended to eliminate certain unfair advantages of patent holders in the implementation of hatch waxman 
as a result of those amendments  the nda owner remains entitled to an automatic month stay if they initiate a patent infringement lawsuit within days of their receipt of notice of our paragraph iv certification  but only if their patent infringement lawsuit is directed to patents that were listed in the orange book before the anda was filed 
where there are no patents listed in the orange book at the time the applicant files its anda  there is no automatic month stay of regulatory approval 
if patents are listed in the orange book after the anda has been filed  the nda owner may still sue the anda applicant for that patent  but the anda will not be subject to an automatic stay of regulatory approval 
an anda applicant is permitted to take legal action to enjoin or prohibit the listing of certain patents in the orange book 
an fda regulation effective august further defines the types of patents that may be listed in the orange book and requires increased disclosure requirements for listed patents in an effort to decrease the number of improperly listed patents 
while most of these changes should help prevent improperly listed patents  the long term effectiveness of this regulation and the december amendments is unclear 
if an anda applicant is the first to file an anda with a paragraph iv certification and provides appropriate notice  the nda holder and all patentees for a particular generic product  the applicant may be awarded a day period of marketing exclusivity against other companies that subsequently file andas containing paragraph iv certifications for that same product 
we believe this period of marketing exclusivity can provide an opportunity for the successful patent challenger to build its market share  to recoup the expense of patent litigation and to realize greater profit margins  and in some cases  to gain value by relinquishing or transferring this marketing exclusivity right to others 
in addition  once that exclusivity period has lapsed  we believe that the marketer of the first commercialized product may more effectively defend its market share position against future competition 
however  an anda applicant s ability to secure the benefit of this exclusivity period  and the actual benefit it gains from the exclusivity period  depends on a variety of factors  some beyond the applicant s control  such as the timing of fda approval  whether other anda applicants share that exclusivity  patent litigation related to the product and competitors products  raw material availability  and whether the brand product will also be marketed as a generic sometimes referred to as an authorized generic 
court decisions  fda interpretations  legislative changes and the date of filing of an anda all affect  among other things  how this exclusivity period is to be awarded  how it is affected by other anda applicants  and the benefit  if any  which may be obtained from the day marketing exclusivity period 
as an example  fda had previously taken the position that it could award shared day marketing exclusivity if different anda applicants were first to file paragraph iv certifications to different patents listed in the orange book for the same product 
this interpretation was both accepted and rejected by two separate united states district courts 
the federal circuit court of appeals declined to address the issue on appeal 
fda has announced that it will continue to rely on this interpretation for andas filed before december  for andas submitted after december   the december hatch waxman amendments to hatch waxman prospectively eliminated patent by patent shared exclusivity  so that the day marketing exclusivity period will only be awarded to the first anda applicant s to assert a paragraph iv certification as to any patent listed in the orange book for the product 
however  fda will award shared day marketing exclusivity to multiple anda applicants who all file the first paragraph iv certification on the same day 
the december amendments to hatch waxman also modify the rules governing when generic products are eligible for day exclusivity periods and when the day exclusivity period is triggered or forfeited 
prior to the amendments  the day marketing exclusivity period was triggered upon the first commercial marketing of the anda or a court decision holding the patent invalid  unenforceable or not infringed 
for andas accepted for filing before march  that court decision had to be final and non appealable  for andas accepted for filing after march  any court decision  including a district court decision  could trigger exclusivity  and in all cases  the court decision trigger did not have to involve the first anda applicant  but could be a court decision by a subsequent anda applicant 
the amendments retroactively apply a final and non appealable court decision trigger for all andas filed before december  as for andas filed after december   exclusivity is only triggered upon the first commercial marketing of the anda product 
however  that exclusivity may be forfeited under certain circumstances  including among other things  if the anda is not marketed by the first filer or another anda applicant within a certain timeframe after a final and non appealable court decision  or if the fda does not tentatively approve the first filer s anda within months 
regulatory approval of an anda may also be affected by the grant of a period of pediatric exclusivity 
pediatric exclusivity rewards brand pharmaceutical companies for conducting research in a pediatric population through the grant of an additional six months of exclusivity  which is attached to any patent or market exclusivity period protecting its product 
thus  where pediatric exclusivity is requested by a brand company and granted by fda  final marketing approval could be delayed by an additional six months 
certain anda procedures for generic controlled release drugs and other products are presently the subject of petitions filed by brand name drug manufacturers  which seek changes from fda in the approval process for generic drugs 
we cannot predict at this time whether fda will make any changes to the anda procedures as a result of such petitions  ongoing rulemakings or litigation  or the effect that such changes may have on us 
any changes in fda regulations  policies or procedures may make anda approvals more difficult or may otherwise have a significant adverse effect on our business 
under the generic drug enforcement act of  the fda is allowed to impose debarment and other penalties on individuals and companies that commit certain illegal acts relating to the generic drug approval process 
in some situations  the generic drug enforcement act requires the fda to not accept or review andas for a period of time from a company or an individual that has committed certain violations 
it also provides for temporary denial of approval of applications during the investigation of certain violations that could lead to debarment and also  in more limited circumstances  provides for the suspension of the marketing of approved drugs by the affected company 
the generic drug enforcement act also allows for civil penalties and withdrawal of previously approved applications 
nda process brand pharmaceuticals approval of a new drug requires the filing and fda approval of an nda 
the nda must contain complete pre clinical  clinical safety and efficacy data  as well as reference to such data or literature 
before clinical testing can begin  stringent governmental requirements for pre clinical evaluation must be satisfied 
pre clinical data are typically obtained from studies in animal species  as well as laboratory studies  and are submitted to fda in an investigational new drug application ind 
the pre clinical data must provide an adequate basis for evaluating both the safety and the scientific rationale for the initiation of clinical trials ie  trials in humans and demonstrate that such studies would not expose subjects to an unreasonable or significant risk of illness or injury 
clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases  phase i  phase ii and phase iii  although the phases may overlap 
the process of completing clinical trials for a new drug typically takes several years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
preparing an nda involves considerable data collection  verification  analysis and expense 
the approval process is affected by a number of factors  including the risks and benefits of a drug product as demonstrated in clinical trials  the severity of the target disease or health condition and the availability of alternative treatments 
fda or other health authorities may deny approval of an nda if the regulatory criteria are not satisfied  or may require additional testing or information before an nda will be approved 
the safety and effectiveness testing necessary to obtain approval of an nda is time consuming and expensive 
the ndas we submitted for altoprev  fortamet and zalkote which is currently pending marketing approval  our internally developed brand pharmaceutical products  used a procedure permitted by section b of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act 
a section b nda must contain safety and effectiveness studies  but may rely on published reports or prior fda determinations that related products are safe and effective eg  approval of a controlled release version of a previously approved immediate release drug product for those studies 
thus  by eliminating the need for certain duplicative testing  the section b nda process may significantly reduce the time and expense of new drug development 
there are limitations on the use of section b ndas  however 
first  patent listing certification requirements and exclusivity awarded to reference or competitor products may result in the lengthy and uncertain delay of approvals similar to those described above for andas 
second  the extent to which section b ndas may rely upon prior fda findings that reference listed drugs are safe and effective for approved uses is currently being challenged 
for example  abbott has filed a citizens petition asserting that the andrx nda for zalkote should not be approved on these grounds 
there may therefore be limitations on a section b nda applicant s ability to innovate without conducting substantial clinical testing 
nda products  including section b ndas  may qualify for specific patent and marketing exclusivity protections against competitive products submitted for approval via the section b nda or anda processes 
patent infringement litigation patent litigation can be a part of the business of bringing some generic or brand pharmaceuticals to market 
if such action is filed within the day period prescribed by law  such litigation may  in certain circumstances  result in a delay in fda s ability to approve the marketing of a pharmaceutical product 
numerous patent infringement actions have been filed against us  and we have been successful in resolving many of such litigation matters  either through a court decision or through settlement  in a manner that permits our product to be marketed 
examples of this litigation include former proceedings relating to our generic versions of dilacor xr  cardizem cd  glucotrol xl  tiazac  remeron  claritin d  claritin d  claritin reditabs  monopril and monopril hct 
we did not prevail in our patent infringement litigation involving our generic version of prilosec and are currently unable to market such product 
we are continuing to litigate patent issues pertaining to our generic versions of naprelan and toprol xl  as well as our brand valproate product see  ongoing patent litigation 
though the patent litigation pertaining to our generic versions of wellbutrin sr and zyban was dismissed  we have not received final fda marketing approval for those products 
patent litigation was also filed against andrx and carlsbad  one of our joint venture partners  with respect to the raw material used in the generic version of pepcid that carlsbad developed and that we sell as part of our caran joint venture 
this litigation was settled 
we anticipate that additional actions may be filed as we or companies we collaborate with file additional andas containing paragraph iv certifications 
the outcome of patent litigation or any litigation is difficult to predict because of the uncertainties inherent to litigation 
our business could be harmed by the delay in obtaining fda approval to market our products as a result of patent litigation both with respect to patents listed with fda when the anda was filed and thereafter  the delay in obtaining judicial decisions in such litigation  the expense of litigation whether or not we are successful  or an adverse outcome of such litigation 
moreover  this litigation or other events may precipitate additional litigation affecting the marketing of our products 
we often encounter substantial delay in obtaining judicial decisions in anda paragraph iv litigation 
such delay could cause us to decide to launch a product prior to final resolution of the pending litigation 
the risk involved in doing so can be substantial because the remedies available to the owner of a patent for infringement include  among other things  damages measured by the profits lost by the patent owner and not by the profits earned by the infringer 
because of the discount pricing typically involved with generic products  patented brand products generally realize a higher profit margin than generic products 
in the case of a willful infringer  the definition of which is unclear  such damages may be trebled 
we believe that this profit differential can act as a disincentive for the patent holder to settle patent litigation on terms that will allow our products to be marketed upon the settlement of that litigation 
thus  we have faced  and will continue to be faced with  the decision of whether  and in what manner  time frame or other circumstances  we should launch our product prior to the conclusion of patent litigation  or to discontinue selling our product in the face of new patent litigation 
in making these determinations  we intend to consider and balance what we then believe are the relevant considerations and factors  including i the risk that our product will be found to infringe the brand product  the size of the market and the claim for damages that could result from the sale of an infringing product  and other costs  including inventory  ii the potential claim for damages that could result from the sale of an infringing product against our current capital resources  and our future capital needs  iii the risk of being enjoined from making such sales and thereby losing our exclusivity rights for such product  iv the possibility that launching the product may increase the incentive for the owner of the patented brand product to settle the pending litigation on a basis that would allow us to continue to market our product without further legal risk  and v the lost opportunity cost if we do not have available launch quantities of our product when the patent litigation is ultimately resolved  particularly in instances where that court decision starts the day period of marketing exclusivity for us  and additional competition awaits the expiration of that period of marketing exclusivity 
ongoing patent infringement litigation following submission of a paragraph iv certification that our anda product candidate does not infringe the valid patent rights of the referenced brand product  we would anticipate that patent infringement litigation will be commenced against us 
generally  unless we commence selling such anda product before the related litigation has been concluded  we would not incur any substantial damages in connection with this type of litigation 
naproxen sodium naprelan in march  the us district court for the southern district of florida issued an order that elan corporation plc s patent was invalid  and in september  we commenced selling naproxen sodium  our generic version of naprelan 
in march  the district court issued an order denying  among other things  i elan s motion for reconsideration of the march order invalidating its patent  and ii our motion asking the district court for a ruling on our non infringement defenses 
both parties appealed that march decision 
on may   the federal circuit court of appeals reversed the district court s determination that the elan patent was invalid  and remanded the case back to the district court for a determination as to whether our product infringes the elan patent 
on august   the district court entered an order indicating that it will delay issuing findings of fact and conclusions in this matter until the federal circuit court of appeals has issued its decision in a non related case on how a court should address issues of claim construction 
we are continuing to sell our generic version of naprelan 
however  in january  elan both sought a status conference with the district court to amend that order and filed a new complaint in the us district court for the southern district of florida seeking willful damages as a result of our sale of our generic version of naprelan 
though we are not in a position to determine the ultimate outcome of this matter  an adverse determination could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial statements 
metoprolol succinate toprol xl in and  we filed andas seeking fda approval to market metoprolol succinate extended release tablets in the mg  mg  mg and mg strengths  respectively  our generic versions of toprol xl 
astrazeneca ab  aktiebolaget hassle and astrazeneca lp sued us for patent infringement in the us district court for the district of delaware in february on the mg strength  in july on the mg strength  and in december on the mg and mg strengths 
on august   the multidistrict litigation panel consolidated and sent to the us district court for the eastern district of missouri the three pending metoprolol succinate patent infringement cases brought by astra against andrx and two other generic drug companies for pretrial discovery purposes 
the trial of this matter has been tentatively scheduled to begin in august sodium valproate we filed an anda seeking fda approval to market a generic version of depakote  and in march  abbott laboratories sued us in the us district court for the southern district of florida for patent infringement 
the fda refused to accept our anda and as a result  we filed a b application to market a sodium valproate product that is bioequivalent to depakote 
in may  abbott filed a new infringement complaint against us in the same us district court in connection with our new application 
both cases were consolidated and the original anda lawsuit was subsequently dismissed without prejudice 
the trial of this matter has been tentatively scheduled to begin in july paroxetine hydrochloride paxil we filed an anda seeking fda approval to market paroxetine hydrochloride mg  our generic version of paxil mg  and in june  smithkline beecham corporation and beecham group plc smithkline sued us  and our raw material supplier  in the us district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania for patent infringement 
we later amended our anda to add the mg  mg and mg strengths of paroxetine hydrochloride and in november  smithkline filed a new infringement complaint against us in the us district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania in connection with those lower strengths 
these cases and several other cases related to other companies andas for generic versions of paxil were consolidated for pre trial discovery purposes only 
in april  the us court of appeals for the federal circuit invalidated smithkline s hemihydrate patent in a case not directly involving us 
thereafter  smithkline voluntarily dismissed its claims against us relating to all but the hemihydrate patent 
with respect to the hemihydrate patent  the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania entered an order on july  staying ie  placing on hold all discovery and pre trial proceedings against us pending the outcome of smithkline s appeal of the federal circuit decision 
if that decision is not overturned  smithkline has agreed to dismiss its remaining claims against us 
in september  we withdrew our andas for paxil  which will likely lead to the dismissal of this action as being moot 
omeprazole prilosec in  we filed an anda seeking approval from the fda to market omeprazole  our generic version of prilosec 
in may  astrazeneca plc filed suit under the provisions of the hatch waxman act alleging patent infringement 
the matter was tried in the us district court for the southern district of new york along with the consolidated claims of three other anda applicants 
in october  the district court entered an order and an opinion finding that astra s and patents are valid and that the generic versions of prilosec developed by us infringe those patents 
on december   the federal circuit court of appeals affirmed the lower court s opinion that astra s patents are valid and infringed by our product 
astra advised the district court that it believes it may be entitled to damages as a result of our decision to build an inventory of our product prior to the district court s determination  but has not sought to enforce such claims 
on may   the district court ruled that our product does not infringe any valid claims of the patent  and that astra s and patents are not unenforceable against our product 
both astra and we have appealed this determination 
the district court has not issued an opinion on astra s claims for willful infringement of the and patents or on astra s request for attorneys fees 
though we believe that astra is unlikely to prevail in its request for damages or attorneys fees and that astra has not been damaged as a result of our decision to build inventory prior to the district court s determination  if astra were to prevail in these claims  it could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements 
the following patent infringement matters were resolved in bupropion hydrochloride wellbutrin sr zyban in june  we filed andas seeking fda approval to market bupropion hydrochloride  our generic versions of wellbutrin sr zyban 
in september  glaxo smithkline glaxo filed suit against us in the us district court for the southern district of florida  claiming patent infringement 
in may  after settling this matter without payment from us  glaxo dismissed its lawsuit against us 
fosinopril sodium and fosinopril hctz monopril and monopril hct in february  we filed andas seeking fda approval to market fosinopril sodium tablets  our generic version of monopril  and fosinopril sodium hydrochlorothiazide tablets  our generic version of monopril hct 
on april   bristol myers squibb company and er squibb and sons  llc filed identical suits against us in the us district court for the southern district of new york and florida for alleged patent infringement 
the new york action was transferred to florida and on april   dismissed 
on june   after a trial on the merits  the u 
s district court for the southern district of florida issued a final judgment of non infringement in our favor 
bristol myers did not appeal the judgment 
seasonality there are no significant seasonal aspects to our business  except that shipments of pharmaceutical products indicated for cold and flu symptoms are typically higher during the fourth quarter as customers supplement inventories in anticipation of the cold and flu season 
personnel as of december   andrx had approximately  employees 
the following chart generally reflects the areas in which such personnel are engaged distribution generic brand corporate total sales marketing research and development manufacturing quality and regulatory affairs administration warehouse shipping maintenance though certain of these personnel perform work on both generic and brand products  all such personnel are included in the generic segment 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following factors and other information contained and incorporated by reference in this form k 
any of these risks could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
any of these events could also cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
risks relating to andrx as we are dependent on a small number of products  a loss of revenues from certain products prior to the introduction of significant new products could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
currently  our overall level of profitability depends in large part on a relatively small number of products 
if the revenues and profitability we derive from these products  and particularly our generic version of cardizem cd  and to a lesser extent our generic versions of tiazac  our claritin products d and reditabs  and glucotrol xl which we currently purchase from pfizer  were to be significantly reduced prior to the introduction of significant new products  it would adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
such reductions could result from many factors  including  among other things  price reductions and or reduced market share as a result of competition  cgmp  manufacturing or regulatory issues  and or the unavailability of raw materials or finished product 
potential new competition for our generic versions of cardizem cd and tiazac products could arise at any time 
the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive  and is affected by new technologies  financing and numerous other factors 
our competitors vary with respect to each of our operations  and many of our competitors have greater financial  research and development  marketing and other resources than we do 
we expect to be subject to competition from numerous other entities that currently operate or intend to operate in the pharmaceutical industry 
we also face competition for the acquisition or licensing of new product opportunities from other companies 
our sales efforts for generic products compete with domestic and international companies and with generic divisions of large brand pharmaceutical companies that may offer a wider variety of generic products to their customers 
some of these companies currently engage in the development of controlled release products 
even more develop immediate release products 
some of these companies manufacture their products in other countries  such as india and china  where raw materials are obtained and finished product can be manufactured at a significantly lower cost 
the unit price of a generic product will generally decline as the number of generic competitors increases or the existing competitors seek to expand their market share 
the timing and extent of these price decreases is unpredictable and can result in significantly reduced profitability for a generic product 
the profitability of our generic products may also be affected by the market withdrawal of the corresponding brand product  competition with that brand product  the promotion of an alternative to that brand product including a follow on or otc version of that product  the marketing of an authorized generic  and by the significant reduction in the amount of large customers for generic products 
in our pharmaceutical distribution business  we compete with a number of large wholesalers and other distributors of pharmaceuticals  including mckesson corporation  amerisourcebergen corporation and cardinal health  inc  which market both brand and generic pharmaceutical products to their customers 
we believe that increased competition  the growing role of managed care organizations mcos  the formation of buying groups and competition between manufacturers could result in increased price erosion and competition for market share 
in the sales efforts for our brand products  we compete with large domestic and international brand pharmaceutical companies with significantly larger and more experienced sales forces and significantly greater financial resources to support their products 
as these pharmaceutical companies compete aggressively to have their products included in formularies  our lack of a broad range of brand products places us at a competitive disadvantage when competing for inclusion on some mco formularies 
our brand sales may also be affected by our announced agreement to divest this segment of our business  the introduction of new brand products in the same therapeutic class and by the advent of generic competition for our products 
if we are unable to successfully develop and commercialize new products  our operating results will suffer 
our future results of operations will depend to a significant extent upon our ability to successfully develop and commercialize new generic products in a timely manner 
we can encounter numerous difficulties in our efforts to develop and commercialize our new products  including remaining at all times in compliance with regulatory standards and the specifications set forth in our andas  scaling up production to commercial levels in a timely manner  securing  on a timely basis and on commercially reasonable terms  all of the raw materials required for the manufacture of our products  receiving requisite regulatory approvals to commercialize our products in a timely manner  avoiding the commercialization delays which may result under the regulatory process  and successfully defending legal actions including citizens petitions brought by our direct competitors or others who seek to prevent or delay the commercialization of our products 
these and other difficulties may delay  prevent or stop the marketing of our products  and products being developed or manufactured in collaboration with others 
we cannot guarantee that any investment we make in developing products will be recouped  even if we are successful in commercializing those products 
litigation claiming that our products infringe the proprietary rights of third parties  and other litigation  may delay or prevent us from manufacturing and commercializing our products or result in substantial damages 
the manufacture  use and sale of pharmaceutical products  and their ingredients  have been the subject of substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical industry  particularly in the context of paragraph iv litigation involving the andas and ndas filed with the fda 
these lawsuits can  and have  delayed or prevented the marketing of some of our products 
we anticipate that additional actions may be commenced against our products in the future 
litigation is generally costly and time consuming  and can divert the attention of our management and technical personnel 
the timing and outcome of litigation is difficult to predict and inherently uncertain 
if our products  or their ingredients  infringe on the rights of others  we could lose our right to develop or manufacture products  be required to license proprietary rights from third parties or be required to pay monetary damages  in the form of lost profits  a reasonable royalty or a combination of the two 
such damages could even apply if we did not begin to sell that product until after the relevant patent expired 
although the parties to patent and intellectual property disputes in the pharmaceutical industry have often settled their disputes through licensing or similar arrangements  the costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that the necessary licenses would be available to us on terms we believe to be acceptable 
as a result  an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products  which could harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we often encounter delays in obtaining judicial decisions in connection with patent litigation  and may not be able to obtain a final or even a preliminary judicial decision as to whether our products  or the material incorporated therein  infringe the intellectual property rights of others at the time fda approves the marketing of our product  and we are otherwise able to do so 
if we were to wait for a preliminary or final judicial decision  we face the risk that  during the interim  additional competition may arise  the brand product may be offered as an authorized generic or an otc product  other brand products may be introduced and promoted to prescribers instead of  or in addition to  the brand  additional exclusivities may be awarded to the brand product  additional patents that cover the brand product may issue or be listed in the orange book  the labeling of the brand product may change or other matters could occur that lessen the economic opportunity for our product 
we could invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of our generic products only to be subject to significant additional delay and changes in the economic prospects for our products 
accordingly  we may be faced with the decision whether we should commercialize our products prior to final resolution of our pending litigation 
the risk involved in marketing these products can be substantial because the remedies available to the owner of a patent for infringement could include  among other things  damages measured by the profits lost by the patent owner as opposed to the profits earned by the infringer 
because of the discount pricing typically involved with generic products  brand products generally realize a significantly higher profit margin than generic products 
in the case of a willful infringer  the definition of which is unclear  these damages may even be trebled 
this profit differential can act as a disincentive to the patent holder to settle patent litigation on terms that could allow our products to be marketed upon the settlement of such litigation 
thus  in order to reap the economic benefits of some of our products  we may decide to risk an amount  which exceeds the profit we anticipate making on our product  or even the selling price for such product 
in addition to the risks associated with patent litigation described above  we are also involved in the other litigation matters more particularly described in item litigation 
an adverse judgment in any of our pending or future litigation matters could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
our failure to prevail in any of the litigation matters reflected in item litigation  as well as item patent infringement litigation could result in material damages or adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
our business could suffer as a result of manufacturing issues 
the continued increase in the amount of products we market and those pending approval at the fda requires us to continue to expand our manufacturing capabilities  including making changes to our manufacturing facilities in florida 
an expansion is underway in our davie  florida facility to significantly increase our cgmp manufacturing capacity 
the timely completion of these efforts is necessary for us to maintain sufficient manufacturing capacity for the anticipated quantities of the products we expect to market in the future 
we are also upgrading our high potency manufacturing operations at certain of our other facilities in south florida 
our manufacturing and other processes utilize sophisticated equipment  which sometimes requires a significant amount of time to obtain and install 
although we endeavor to properly maintain our equipment and spare parts on hand  our business could suffer if certain manufacturing or other equipment  or a portion or all of our facilities were to become inoperable for a period of time 
this could occur for various reasons  including catastrophic events such as hurricane or explosion  unexpected equipment failures or delays in obtaining components or replacements thereof  as well as construction delays or defects and other events  both within and outside of our control 
the manufacture of certain of our generic products and product candidates  such as our controlled release products and generic concerta and oral contraceptives  is more difficult than the manufacture of immediate release products 
successful manufacturing of these types of products requires precise manufacturing process controls  raw materials that conform to very tight tolerances for specific characteristics and equipment that operates consistently within narrow performance ranges 
manufacturing complexity  testing requirements  and safety and security processes combine to increase the overall difficulty of manufacturing these products and resolving manufacturing problems that we may encounter 
our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected if we are unable to timely complete our construction  conversion and upgrading projects  or adequately equip our facilities in a timely manner  or we are otherwise unable to manufacture any of our significant products 
in addition  we sometimes file an anda or nda based on study results utilizing product batches that are smaller than what we anticipate may be required for the commercial launch of that product 
thus  in order to manufacture these products for commercial launch  we must scale up our manufacturing process for use on larger equipment  in accordance with fda regulations 
our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully scale up any of our significant products or if successful scale up of any such product is delayed 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient supplies of raw materials from key suppliers that in some cases may be the only source of those supplies  our ability to manufacture and market our products may be impaired 
some of the raw materials used in the manufacture of our generic and brand products are available from limited sources and  in some cases  a single source 
any curtailment in the availability of these raw materials could be accompanied by production or other delays and  in the case of products for which only one raw material supplier exists or has been approved by the fda  could result in a material loss of sales  with consequential adverse effects on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
in addition  because raw material sources for pharmaceutical products must generally be identified and approved by regulatory authorities  changes in raw material suppliers may result in production delays  higher raw material costs and loss of sales and customers 
we also obtain a portion of our raw materials from foreign suppliers  and our arrangements with these suppliers are subject to  among other risks  fda approval  governmental clearances  natural disasters  export duties  political instability  currency fluctuations and restrictions on the transfer of funds abroad 
we have at times experienced problems as a result of a lack of availability of raw materials 
these problems result from the supplier s delay in providing these materials  delays in getting these materials through customs  the closure of a particular materials source and the unavailability of a comparable replacement  and defects in the materials received by us 
we have at times also experienced problems as a result of our acquisition cost of raw materials becoming too close to  or even more than  the price at which finished pharmaceutical product may be obtained in the marketplace 
while we have improved our efforts to actively identify alternative and redundant sources of raw materials and negotiated lower prices for current raw materials  any inability to obtain raw materials on a timely and cost effective basis could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
from time to time  we purchase raw materials and make commercial quantities of our product candidates prior to the date that we receive fda final marketing approval or satisfactory resolution of the patent infringement litigation  if any 
purchase of raw materials and production of pre launch inventories involves the risks that such product may not be approved for marketing by the fda on a timely basis or ever  that such approval may require additional or different testing and or specifications than what was performed in the manufacture of such pre launch inventory and that we may be liable for patent infringement damages 
if any of these risks were to occur or the launch of such products is significantly postponed  we may be required to reassess the net realizable value of the related raw materials or inventory and could  in such case  incur a charge  which may be significant  to write down the value of such materials or inventory 
there are inherent uncertainties involved in the estimates  judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements  and any changes in those estimates  judgments and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
the consolidated and condensed consolidated financial statements that we file with the sec are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap involves making estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the most significant estimates we are required to make under gaap include  but are not limited to  those related to revenue recognition and sales returns and allowances  allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  inventories and cost of goods sold  useful life or impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets  litigation settlements and related accruals  income taxes  and self insurance programs 
in instances where we have entered into collaborative agreements for the sale of certain generic products  the net revenues that we have reported are subject to numerous estimates by these other parties  such as returns and other sales allowances and certain related expenses 
we periodically evaluate estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for reasonableness  including estimates provided by those with whom we have entered into collaborative agreements 
appropriate adjustments to the estimates will be prospectively made  as necessary  based on such periodic evaluations 
we base our estimates on  among other things  currently available information  our historical experience and on various assumptions  which together form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
although we believe that these assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances  estimates would differ if different assumptions were utilized and these estimates may prove in the future to have been inaccurate 
allowances against sales for estimated discounts  rebates  returns  chargebacks  shelf stock adjustments and other sales allowances are established by us concurrently with the recognition of revenue 
our most significant sales allowances vary depending upon the business segment 
in our distribution business  our most significant sales allowances are for estimated returns  discounts and rebates 
sales returns and allowances for estimated discounts and rebates have historically have been predictable and less subjective 
in our generic business  our most significant sales allowances are for estimated discounts  customer and medicaid rebates  returns  chargebacks and shelf stock adjustments 
the estimates for returns  chargebacks and shelf stock adjustments are more subjective and  consequently  may be more variable 
in our brand business  our most significant sales allowances are for estimated discounts  returns and medicaid and managed care rebates 
the estimates for returns are more subjective and  therefore  may be more variable 
these allowances are established based upon consideration of a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  prescription data  inventory reports and other information received from our customers and other third parties  our customers right of return  historical information by product  the number and timing of competitive products approved for sale  both historically and as projected  the estimated size of the market for our products  current and projected economic conditions  anticipated future product pricing  future levels of prescriptions for our products and other analyses that we perform 
we believe that the sales allowance accruals are reasonably determinable and are based on the information available at that time to arrive at our best estimate of the accruals 
the key assumptions used to arrive at our best estimate of the accruals for sales allowances are our estimate of inventory levels in the distribution channel  our estimates of future price changes and potential returns 
our estimates of prescription data  inventory at customers and in the distribution channel are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third party data  as certain third party information may itself rely on estimates  and reflect other limitations 
actual product returns  chargebacks  shelf stock adjustments and other sales allowances incurred are dependent upon future events 
we periodically monitor the factors that influence sales returns and allowances and make adjustments to these provisions when we believe that actual product returns  chargebacks  shelf stock adjustments and other sales allowances may differ from previously established allowances 
if conditions in future periods change  revisions to previous estimates may be required  potentially in significant amounts 
changes in the level of provisions for estimated product returns  chargebacks  shelf stock adjustments and other sales allowances will affect revenues 
if we are unable to adequately protect our technology  our business could suffer 
our success with the products that we develop will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain patent protection for these products 
we currently have a number of us and foreign patents issued and pending 
we cannot be sure that we will receive patents for any of our patent applications 
furthermore  the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or as to the enforceable scope of the claims of the patent 
accordingly  our patents may not prevent other companies from developing similar or functionally equivalent products or from successfully challenging the validity of our patents 
if our patent applications are not approved or  even if approved  such patents are circumvented or not upheld in a court of law  our ability to competitively exploit our patented products and technologies may be significantly reduced 
also  such patents may or may not provide competitive advantages for their respective products or they may be challenged or circumvented by competitors  in which case our ability to commercially exploit these products may be diminished 
from time to time  we may need to obtain licenses to patents and other proprietary rights held by third parties to develop  manufacture and market our products 
if we are unable to timely obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms  our ability to commercially exploit such products may be inhibited or prevented 
we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how that we seek to protect  in part  through confidentiality agreements with our partners  customers  employees and consultants 
it is possible that one or more of these agreements will be breached or that they will not be fully enforceable in every instance  and that we will not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
it is also possible that our trade secrets will become known or independently developed by our competitors 
if we are unable to adequately protect our technology  our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 
we may need to rely on licenses to proprietary technologies  which may be difficult or expensive to obtain 
we may need to obtain licenses to patents and other proprietary rights held by third parties to develop  manufacture and market products 
if we are unable to obtain these licenses or unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms in a timely manner  our ability to commercially exploit one or more of our products may be inhibited or prevented 
we may have to pay additional tax as a result of audits by the internal revenue service 
our federal income tax returns for the years to are currently under audit by the internal revenue service 
despite our belief that our tax return positions are correct and supportable  our policy is to establish accruals for tax contingencies that may result from examinations by tax authorities 
while it is difficult to predict the final outcome of any particular tax matter  we believe that our tax accruals provide an adequate allowance for such contingencies 
the tax accruals are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made  as events occur to warrant such adjustment 
our effective tax rate and or cash flows may be materially impacted by the ultimate resolution of our tax positions 
our operations could be disrupted if our information systems fail or if we are unsuccessful in implementing necessary upgrades 
our business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications software and hardware systems  and our other information technology 
we have substantially completed the implementation of significant upgrades to our information systems  including the implementation and qualification of our jde software 
if our systems were to fail or we were unable to successfully expand the capacity of these systems or to integrate new technologies into our existing systems  our operations and financial results could suffer 
the loss of our key personnel could cause our business to suffer 
the success of our present and future operations will depend  to a significant extent  upon the experience  abilities and continued service of key personnel  including senior corporate and divisional executive officers 
we cannot be assured that we will be able to attract and retain key personnel  and our failure to do so could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we will continue to incur losses in the brand business until we conclude our disposition of this business unit 
on march   we entered into agreements for the sale and licensing of certain rights and assets related to our fortamet and altoprev brand pharmaceutical products 
the closing of this transaction is subject to certain customary conditions including clearance under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act 
we anticipate continuing to operate our brand business unit until the closing occurs  which we anticipate to be on or before may subsequent to the closing  we have agreed to provide certain transition services 
in connection with this divestiture  we estimate that we will incur personnel related expenses of approximately million  including severance  performance incentives and retention 
in addition  we estimate we will incur approximately million in other costs  including million in non cash charges 
until that disposition is completed  net sales of our brand products could be adversely affected by the reduction in our existing sales force as a result of our announced intention to dispose of this business to first horizon or manufacturing issues which  as of march   we are experiencing with respect to altoprev 
our sales of generic products may suffer if the use of such products is limited through legislative  regulatory and other efforts 
pharmaceutical companies increasingly have used state and federal legislative  regulatory and other means to delay generic product competition 
these efforts have included pursuing new patents that could extend patent protection for their brand products and delay the launch of generic competition  selling the brand product as an authorized generic  either by the brand company directly  through an affiliate or by a marketing partner  pursuing pediatric exclusivity for their brand products  using the citizens petition process to request amendments to fda standards  seeking changes to us pharmacopeia  an organization that publishes industry recognized compendia of drug standards  attaching patent extension amendments to unrelated federal legislation  and engaging in state by state initiatives to enact legislation that restricts the substitution of certain generic products 
if pharmaceutical companies are successful in limiting the use of generic products through these or other means or in securing changes in fda regulations  policies or procedures  the approval of our generic products may be adversely affected  which could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
sales of our generic and brand products may be adversely affected by the consolidation or loss of our customers 
in recent years  the distribution network for both brand and generic products has undergone significant consolidation marked by mergers and acquisitions among wholesalers and the growth of large retail drug store chains and mail order pharmacies that control a significant share of the market 
as a result of the concentration of the customer base and the potential for further consolidation  the loss of any of our customers or significant defaults in payment or reductions in purchases from our customers could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
our distribution business concentrates on generic products and is therefore subject to the risks of the generic industry 
the ability of our distribution business to provide consistent  sequential quarterly growth is affected  in large part  by our participation in the launch of new products by us and other generic manufacturers and the subsequent advent and extent of competition encountered by these products 
this competition can result in significant and rapid declines in the prices of these products and a corresponding decrease in the net sales of our distribution operations 
our margins can also be affected by the risks inherent to the generic industry 
our business could suffer if we experience difficulties in integrating any technologies  products and businesses we acquire  or if we incur significant charges to earnings with respect to such acquisitions 
we regularly review potential acquisitions of technologies  products and businesses 
acquisitions typically entail many risks and could result in difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of companies that we acquire and the technologies and products that we acquire 
if we are not able to successfully integrate our acquisitions  we may not obtain the advantages that the acquisitions were intended to create  which could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
in addition  in connection with acquisitions  we could experience disruption in our business or employee base 
there is also a risk that key employees of companies that we acquire or key employees necessary to successfully commercialize technologies and products that we acquire may seek employment elsewhere  including with our competitors 
as a result of acquiring businesses or products or entering into other significant transactions  we may incur significant charges to earnings for merger and related expenses  including transaction costs  closure costs and acquired in process research and development charges 
these costs may include substantial fees for investment bankers  attorneys  accountants and other advisors and severance and other closure costs associated with the elimination of duplicate or discontinued products  operations and facilities 
charges that we may incur in connection with acquisitions could adversely affect our results of operations for a particular quarter or annual period 
our business could suffer from rising insurance costs  the unavailability of insurance or other events 
the cost of insurance  including directors and officers  workers compensation  product liability  business interruption and general liability insurance  continues to represent a significant expense to us 
in response  we may increase deductibles and or decrease some coverages to mitigate these costs 
these increases  and our increased risk due to increased deductibles and reduced coverages  could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the design  development  manufacture  sale and utilization of our products and the products we distribute involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and represent a continuing risk  as no reasonable amount of insurance can fully protect against all such risks because of the potential liability inherent to the business of producing or distributing pharmaceuticals for human consumption or use 
although we currently maintain product liability insurance in amounts we believe to be commercially reasonable  product liability insurance is expensive and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts  if it is available at all  particularly for certain classes of products 
a claim brought against us  even if covered by our insurance policies  could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
as most of our operations are located in south florida  on an annual basis we are faced with the possibility of incurring damages or business disruption as a result of a hurricane 
business interruption insurance is expensive and may not be available in amounts that will fully protect us from such occurrences  whether caused by casualties such as hurricanes or fire  or other events  which may or may not be within our control 
we have entered into a consent decree with the sec  and future sec investigations could result in the imposition of severe penalties 
on may   we entered into an administrative consent order with the sec pursuant to which  without admitting or denying the sec s findings  we agreed to cease and desist from committing or causing any future violations of certain of the reporting provisions of the securities exchange act of the order related to the sec s finding that cybear had improperly recognized approximately million in revenue representing approximately  in gross profit pursuant to a joint venture between andrx and cybear 
in a separate matter addressed in the same consent order  the sec found that our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was understated due to the unauthorized actions of an employee who had altered certain of our accounts receivable records 
a future violation of the sec consent decree could result in the imposition of fines or other sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
risks relating to the pharmaceutical industry generally and to andrx specifically our failure to comply with fda  drug enforcement administration dea  licensure and other regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business 
all pharmaceutical companies  including us  are subject to extensive  complex  costly and evolving regulation by the federal government  principally the fda  and  to a lesser extent  by dea  environmental protection agency epa  occupational safety and health administration osha and state government agencies and regulators 
the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  the controlled substances act  the prescription drug marketing act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern or influence the testing  manufacturing  packaging  labeling  storage  purchase  record keeping  safety  approval  marketing  advertising  promotion  sale and distribution of our products and those that we distribute 
the process of complying with these statutes and regulations is rigorous  time consuming and costly  and our failure to comply could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
under these regulations  we are subject to periodic inspection of our facilities  procedures and operations and or the testing of our products by fda  dea  epa  osha and other authorities  which conduct periodic inspections to confirm that we are in compliance with all applicable regulations 
in addition  the fda conducts pre approval and post approval reviews and plant inspections to determine whether our facilities and manufacturing techniques are in compliance with cgmp and other fda regulations 
following these inspections  the fda may provide inspectional observations on a form and issue warning letters that could cause us to modify activities identified during the inspection 
a form is generally issued at the conclusion of an fda inspection and lists conditions the fda staff believes are objectionable conditions with respect to cgmp or other fda regulations 
fda guidelines specify that a warning letter is issued only for violations of regulatory significance for which the failure to adequately and promptly achieve correction may be expected to result in an enforcement action 
any non compliance with cgmp or the corrective action plan we proposed to the fda in response to the form observations issued by the fda on july  and march   and the fda warning letter we received in august  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that the fda will not seek to impose sanctions against us for violations of applicable statutes and regulations 
the range of possible sanctions includes  among others  fda issuance of adverse publicity  product recalls or seizures  fines  total or partial suspension of production and or distribution  suspension of the fda s review of product applications  enforcement actions  injunctions and civil or criminal prosecution 
any such sanctions  if imposed  could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
under some circumstances  the fda also has the authority to revoke previously granted drug approvals 
sanctions similar to those enumerated above may be available to the fda under a consent decree  depending upon the actual terms of such decree 
if our operations are deemed deficient in any significant way  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
some of our vendors are subject to similar regulation and periodic inspections 
we cannot predict the extent to which we  or they  may be affected by these types of regulatory developments 
we are also subject to numerous and increasingly stringent federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other things  the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances and the discharge of pollutants into the air and water 
environmental permits and controls are required for some of our operations  and these permits are subject to modification  renewal and revocation by the issuing authorities 
our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future as a result of changes in environmental laws and regulations or increased manufacturing activities at any of our facilities 
we could be adversely affected by any failure to comply with environmental laws  including the costs of undertaking a clean up at a site to which our wastes were transported 
there is no assurance that our products will receive fda approval or enjoy the benefits of the day exclusivity period 
pharmaceutical manufacturers are generally required to obtain approval from the fda  and possibly other regulatory agencies  before manufacturing  marketing and shipping their products 
this approval process is often costly  time consuming and litigious 
we cannot assure you that our drug applications will be timely approved by the fda or by any other regulatory agency  if at all 
for generic products  fda approval is required before a generic version of a previously approved drug or certain new dosage forms of an existing drug can be marketed  generally using an anda 
however  if some of our generic products do not qualify for anda approval  as may be the case with some of our controlled release formulations  we may be required to proceed under the lengthier and costlier approval process typically associated with brand products 
we may invest a substantial amount of time and money in the development of a generic product only to be subject to significant delay and the uncertain results of patent litigation  or issues relating to the manufacture of our product  which may adversely affect our ability to commercialize our product 
if we are the first anda with a paragraph iv certification accepted for filing by the fda  and timely provide notice of our paragraph iv certification to the nda owner and any patent holders  we may be eligible to receive days of marketing exclusivity 
our ability to secure the benefit of this exclusivity period depends on a variety of factors  some of which are beyond our control  which may decrease the value of the exclusivity period for some of our anda filings 
additionally  marketing exclusivity may also be shared with one or more other generic manufacturers depending on the circumstances 
for brand products  the fda approval process necessitates the filing of an nda  which typically involves time consuming and costly safety and effectiveness testing 
to date  we have submitted for approval our brand name controlled release pharmaceutical products using a type of nda referred to as a section b nda  which enables the applicant to rely on published reports for safety and effectiveness studies  thus reducing the time and expense of new drug development 
there are limitations on the use of section b ndas  however 
b nda s are subject to potential month stays  like andas  but are not eligible for days of marketing exclusivity 
patent listing certification requirements and marketing exclusivity awarded to reference or competitor products may result in delays in the approval process similar to those described above for andas 
there is also a great deal of uncertainty concerning the extent to which section b ndas may rely upon prior fda findings that reference drugs are safe and effective for approved uses  and what additional clinical and other testing is necessary to obtain approval of such applications 
we are subject to therapeutic equivalent substitution  medicaid reimbursement and price reporting  and we and other drug manufacturers may be the target of governmental investigations and related pricing litigation 
federal legislation requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay to state medicaid agencies prescribed rebates on drugs to enable them to be eligible for reimbursement under medicaid programs 
various federal and state medicaid agencies and other enforcement officials are investigating the effects of pharmaceutical industry pricing practices such as how average wholesale price awp and average manufacturer s price amp are calculated and how pharmaceutical manufacturers report their best price on a drug under the federal medicaid rebate program 
awp and amp are standard pricing measures calculated by a third party such as first data bank used throughout the industry as a basis for calculating drug prices under contracts with health plans and pharmacies and rebates with pharmaceutical manufacturers 
there are numerous lawsuits pending throughout the country brought by consumer and governmental entities claiming that drug makers overcharged medicaid for prescription medications  and they were damaged as a result 
we have been named as a defendant in a number of these lawsuits 
we are not in a position to determine the ultimate outcome of this litigation or any other such claims that may subsequently be brought by others  but our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by an adverse determination 
we are subject to post marketing actions 
studies and or monitoring of the proper utilization  safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals are conducted by industry participants including us  government agencies and others 
such studies and monitoring can call into question the utilization  safety and efficacy of previously marketed products  including those marketed by us in our brand and generic operations  and may result in the discontinuation of their marketing or changes in the manner in which they are labeled and prescribed 
fda has the authority to withdraw approvals of previously approved pharmaceutical drugs as a result of such post marketing actions and for other reasons 
the dea and state agencies also have similar authority 
our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any such actions 
federal regulation of arrangements between manufacturers of brand and generic products could adversely affect our business 
we may be required to notify the ftc of agreements that we enter into with other pharmaceutical companies  either pursuant to legislation enacted in january and guidelines issued by the ftc prescribing certain notifications that must be sent to the ftc  or pursuant to the consent decree we entered into with the ftc in may under either scenario  the law by which the ftc or the courts in litigation commenced by private litigants will evaluate such agreements is extremely unclear 
as a result  the manner in which we seek to resolve intellectual property litigation with branded pharmaceutical companies or to commercialize our or other s andas or exclusivity rights could be the subject of additional private party litigation against pharmaceutical companies  additional investigations or proceedings by the ftc or other governmental authorities  or uncertainties concerning the appropriateness of proposed transactions which make commercial sense  but which may potentially have asserted anticompetitive implications 
the changing united states healthcare environment may impact our revenue and income 
our products and services are intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently existing in the united states 
in recent years  the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending 
these changes include an increased reliance on managed care  cuts in medicare funding affecting our healthcare provider customer base  consolidation of competitors  suppliers and customers  and the development of large  sophisticated purchasing groups 
we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future 
some of these potential changes  such as a reduction in governmental support of healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing  healthcare services or mandated benefits  may cause healthcare industry participants to greatly reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services 
changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our income 
federal legislation was enacted in giving medicare beneficiaries a prescription drug benefit in and drug discounts prior to it is uncertain to what extent this legislation will impact us  if at all 
risks associated with investment in our common stock our stock price has experienced volatility  which may affect our stockholders ability to sell their stock at an advantageous price and could impact the market value 
the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
for example  through march   the market price of our common stock has fluctuated during the past months between per share and per share 
therefore  this volatility may affect a stockholder s ability to sell our stock at an advantageous price 
market price fluctuations in our stock may be due to acquisitions  dispositions or other material public announcements  along with a variety of additional factors  including new product introductions  the purchasing practices of our customers  regulatory issues  including receipt of new drug approvals from the fda  compliance with fda or other agency regulations or the lack or failure of either of the foregoing  the ability to manufacture our products and product candidates  changes in the degree of competition for our products  the announcement of technological innovations or new commercial products by our competitors or us  changes in governmental regulation affecting our business environment  any future issuances of our common stock or other securities  the issuance of new patents or other proprietary rights  the announcement of earnings  the publication of earnings estimates or other research reports and speculation in the press or investment community  the loss of key personnel  the inability to acquire sufficient supplies of finished products or raw materials  litigation and or threats of litigation  failure or delay in meeting milestones in collaborative arrangements expected to result in revenues  unanticipated expenses from joint ventures not under our control  publicity regarding actual or potential clinical results with respect to products we have under development or with respect to any consent decree to which we are  or may become  subject  any outbreak or escalation of hostilities  political developments or proposed legislation in the pharmaceutical or healthcare industry  general market and economic conditions  and divestiture or acquisition of businesses or products 
these and similar factors have had and could in the future have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the stock markets in general  including the nasdaq stock market  have experienced extreme price and trading fluctuations 
these fluctuations have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in operating performance 
these broad market fluctuations may affect adversely the market prices of our common stock 
investors should not look to dividends as a source of income 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
we are prohibited from paying dividends under our senior credit facility without the consent of the agent and the lenders parties thereto 
consequently  any economic return to a stockholder will be derived  if at all  from appreciation in the price of our stock  and not as a result of dividend payments 
we may issue additional securities  which would lead to dilution of our issued and outstanding common stock 
our board of directors has the authority to issue shares of our common stock and shares of preferred stock or other securities convertible into shares of our common stock 
under many circumstances  such issuances would not require the approval of our stockholders 
any such preferred stock could contain dividend rights  conversion rights  voting rights  terms of redemption  redemption prices  liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of our common stock 
in march  our board of directors approved the issuance of a stockholder rights plan and authorized the issuance of series a junior participating preferred stock  of which there are currently no shares outstanding 
our stockholder rights plan may deter a third party from acquiring us 
our board of directors has adopted a stockholder rights plan  the purpose of which is to protect stockholders against unsolicited attempts to acquire control of us that do not offer a fair price to all of our stockholders 
the rights plan may have the effect of dissuading a potential acquirer from making an offer for our common stock at a price that represents a premium to the then current trading price 
delaware law and our charter documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover of our company that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares 
some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have anti takeover effects and may delay  defer or prevent a takeover attempt of us 
we are also subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which prevents us from engaging in a business combination with a person who is an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless prescribed approvals are obtained 
the application of section also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us

item legal proceedings see also item patent infringement litigation of this report for a description of certain patent and other litigation 
ongoing other litigation drug pricing litigation on august   the city of new york filed an action in the us district court for the southern district of new york against numerous pharmaceutical companies  including us  claiming they overcharged medicaid for prescription medications 
three similar complaints were filed in january by onondaga  rockland and westchester counties of new york against numerous pharmaceutical companies  including us 
additionally  suffolk county of new york has sought leave to amend its original complaint  wherein the amended complaint seeks to add us and other additional pharmaceutical companies and erie county of new york filed a similar complaint in new york state court in march these complaints generally allege overpayments of varying amounts with respect to our metformin and cartia xt products 
these cases have been  or are expected to be consolidated  in the us district court for the district of massachusetts 
in addition  the state of alabama through its attorney general  has filed a similar lawsuit against numerous pharmaceutical companies  including andrx  in the circuit court of montgomery county  alabama 
there are numerous other lawsuits pending throughout the country brought by consumer and governmental entities related to this issue 
cardizem cd antitrust litigation beginning in august  several putative class action lawsuits were filed against aventis formerly hoechst marion roussel  inc and us arising from a stipulation entered into between aventis and us in connection with a patent infringement suit brought by aventis with regard to its product cardizem cd 
the actions pending in federal court have been consolidated for multi district litigation purposes in the us district court for the eastern district of michigan  with one of the cases filed by a group of direct purchasers having since been remanded back to the us district court for the southern district of florida 
the complaint in each action alleges that aventis and us  by way of the stipulation  have engaged in alleged state antitrust and other statutory and common law violations that allegedly have given aventis and us a near monopoly in the us market for cardizem cd and a generic version of that pharmaceutical product 
each complaint seeks compensatory damages on behalf of each class member in an unspecified amount and  in some cases  treble damages  as well as costs and counsel fees  disgorgement  injunctive relief and other remedies 
in june  the us district court for the eastern district of michigan granted summary judgment to plaintiffs finding that the stipulation was a per se violation of antitrust laws

item selected financial data selected financial data from item included is herein incorporated by reference 
item management s discussion analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our business we are a pharmaceutical company that develops  manufactures and commercializes generic versions of controlled release  niche and immediate release pharmaceutical products  including oral contraceptives  and distributes pharmaceuticals  primarily generics  which have been commercialized by others  as well as our own  primarily to independent pharmacies  pharmacy chains  pharmacy buying groups and physicians offices 
our controlled release pharmaceutical products use our proprietary controlled release drug delivery technologies 
controlled release pharmaceutical products generally provide more consistent drug levels in the bloodstream than immediate release dosage forms and may improve drug efficacy and reduce side effects  by releasing drug dosages at specific times and in specific locations in the gastrointestinal tract of the body 
they also provide patient friendly dosage forms that reduce the number of times a drug must be taken  thus improving patient compliance 
we also commercialize brand pharmaceuticals that  in some instances  use our proprietary controlled release drug delivery technologies 
on march   we entered into agreements with first horizon pharmaceutical corporation for the sale and licensing of certain rights and assets related to our two main brand pharmaceutical products  fortamet and altoprev 
the closing of the transaction  which is subject to certain customary conditions including clearance under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act  is expected to occur by may see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we are focusing our efforts on our core competencies of formulation development of generic versions of controlled release and other pharmaceutical products as well as the sales  marketing and distribution of both our own and others generic pharmaceuticals 
our growth strategies include both internal and external efforts  such as strategic alliances  collaborative agreements and acquisitions 
we continue to seek agreements with third parties that will leverage our formulation capabilities and our controlled release technologies  including but not limited to  agreements to develop combination and other products 
led by the performances of our distribution business and our generic business  we achieved revenues of approximately billion in our distribution business reported revenues of million 
our generic business generated million in revenues  of which million related to product revenues and million related to licensing and royalties revenues 
we launched nine generic products  including two in licensed from genpharm inc  filed abbreviated new drug applications andas  received two tentative approvals and final approvals from the food and drug administration fda 
our brand business generated million in revenues  of which million related to product revenues and million related to licensing and royalties revenues 
we launched our fortamet product in may  and began marketing our cholesterol lowering product  originally launched in june  under the new name  altoprev  in june at the end of  our board of directors approved a plan to divest  or seek other strategic alternatives for our brand pharmaceutical business  which we announced in january we engaged banc of america securities llc to solicit offers for our brand business  which is primarily a sales and marketing organization with a limited number of products 
this plan does not include our entex and anexsia tm product lines  which had revenues of million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  we believe that the brand business will continue to incur operating losses until the disposition of this business is completed 
anticipated operating losses will include charges as a result of our decision to divest our brand business  including retention  performance incentives and severance costs  as well as contract termination costs  including facilities and equipment leases 
on march   we entered into agreements with first horizon for the sale and licensing of certain rights and assets related to our fortamet and altoprev brand pharmaceutical products 
first horizon has agreed to pay us million for fortamet and up to million for altoprev 
the amount that we may receive from first horizon related to altoprev  if any  is contingent upon meeting and maintaining certain supply requirements  as defined 
we will also be entitled to receive royalties on net sales  as defined  of fortamet and altoprev of and  respectively 
we will retain our obligation to pay a royalty to sandoz related to fortamet subject to certain minimums and a maximum 
we have also entered into a long term manufacturing and supply arrangement for fortamet and altoprev with first horizon 
the closing of the transaction  which is subject to certain customary conditions including clearance under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act  is expected to occur by may after that closing occurs  we have agreed to provide certain transitional services to first horizon for a period of time 
in january  we notified pfizer inc that we were exercising our right to terminate our supply and distribution agreement for cardura xl  as a result of fda s failure to approve pfizer s new drug application nda for that product by december  the million we previously paid to pfizer in connection with the execution of the agreement was refunded to us in february in  we recorded numerous charges to cost of goods sold  including million for production related write offs  million for write offs of pre launch inventories  and a million write down of our north carolina facility as a result of our june determination that we would discontinue renovation of that facility  and it is more likely than not that this facility will be sold 
we also incurred charges of approximately million related to under utilization and inefficiencies at our manufacturing facilities and million related to the impairment of our entex product rights 
while our goal in is to significantly reduce production write offs  we expect to continue to experience significant charges to cost of goods sold as a result of production related write offs and inefficiencies at our manufacturing facilities 
we will also charge excess capacity directly to cost of goods sold until such time as the level of production meets the normal capacity requirements subsequent to our florida renovation 
in  we also incurred million in litigation settlement charges  primarily a million settlement relating to the altoprev name change 
key performance factors in our generic business  growth will continue to result primarily from the launch of our new products and will be influenced by the extent of competition such products will encounter 
such growth will be offset by reductions in price and market share of our existing products 
in our distribution business  growth will continue to be primarily a function of our participation in the distribution of new generic products launched by others  offset by the net price declines typically associated with the distribution of generic products over time 
our operating results have been and continue to be highly dependent on a limited number of products  particularly the revenues from our generic versions of cardizem cd and  to a lesser extent  tiazac  glucotrol xl currently supplied by pfizer  and our generic versions of claritin products marketed by l 
perrigo company as store brand over the counter otc products  as well as results of our distribution business  which is generally reflective of the growth of the generic industry as a whole 
our future operating results will be less dependent on revenues from altoprev and fortamet and the related sales and marketing expenses from our brand business once we close the transaction with first horizon  and less dependent on licensing revenues due to the expiration of our agreements with teva pharmaceuticals curacao nv and impax laboratories  inc related to generic versions of wellbutrin sr mg and zyban 
our future operating results may also be highly affected by production related write offs  inefficiencies and excess capacity at our manufacturing facilities 
future operating results will also be dependent on the extent of operating losses our brand business incurs until we close the transaction with first horizon  the timing and extent of additional competition for our existing generic products  and the timing of our launch of our future generic products  particularly our generic versions of concerta  biaxin xl  toprol xl and additional oral contraceptives  and the extent of competition that those products will face 
the timing and value of generic product introductions depends on a number of factors  including successful scale up  receiving fda marketing approval  satisfactory resolution of patent litigation and citizen petitions  our manufacturing capabilities and capacities  our maintaining compliance with current good manufacturing practices cgmp and other fda guidelines  competition  the expiration of others patent and exclusivity rights  and various other factors described in this annual report on form k  our earlier quarterly reports on form q  and in our other us securities and exchange commission sec filings 
cash requirements our most significant cash requirement will be for facilities  machinery and equipment related to the expansion of our florida manufacturing facilities 
capital expenditures are currently estimated to be million in in connection with the divestiture of our brand business  we estimate that we will incur personnel related expenses of approximately million  including severance  performance incentives and retention 
in addition  we estimate we will incur approximately million in other costs which consist of approximately million in non cash charges primarily related to potential lease impairments as well as payments of approximately million for transaction costs and contract termination costs 
our income tax return reflected a significant tax loss as the result of certain ordinary business developments 
we believe the loss is appropriate and deductible 
nevertheless  we have recorded an accrual  which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets  to fully offset the resulting and income tax benefits of approximately million and million  respectively 
the remaining federal loss carryforward of approximately million tax effected  may be available to reduce certain future taxable income  which at that time may be similarly offset by an accrual for financial reporting purposes 
the internal revenue service irs has begun an audit of our tax return and will likely challenge the tax loss 
as of december   the accrual for this tax loss was million and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
if the irs were to prevail  we would be required to pay an amount up to the accrual  which will include interest at the statutory rate 
if we were to prevail or settle this issue with the irs  we would reverse all or a portion of the accrual  reduce income tax expenses accordingly  and pay the irs the settlement amount  if any  including interest at the statutory rate 
our tax accruals are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant such adjustment 
it is reasonably possible that our effective tax rate and or cash flows may be materially impacted by the ultimate resolution of our tax positions 
we had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments available for sale at december  as a result of the january termination of our supply and distribution agreement with pfizer for cardura xl  pfizer refunded million to us in february in addition  we have a million secured credit facility  of which million was available as of december   pursuant to the borrowing base limits 
no amounts were outstanding under this credit facility as of december  our contractual obligations are as follows payment due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheet total absent a significant acquisition of a product or business or other presently unforeseen circumstances  we anticipate that our existing capital resources and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to enable us to maintain our operations and meet our capital expenditure requirements and other commitments through at least the next months without drawing on our credit facility

the equity reorganization and conversion of cybear group common stock andrx was organized in august as a florida corporation 
on september   we completed a reorganization whereby we acquired the outstanding equity of our cybear inc subsidiary that we did not own  reincorporated in delaware  and created two new classes of common stock i andrx common stock to track the performance of the andrx group  which then included andrx corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries  other than its ownership of the cybear group and ii cybear common stock to track the performance of the cybear group 
cybear group then included i cybear inc and its subsidiaries  ii certain potential future internet businesses of andrx corporation  and iii certain operating assets of aht corporation 
mediconsult 
com  inc and its subsidiaries were added to the cybear group following our acquisition by merger of mediconsult 
com  inc in april on may   each share of cybear common stock was converted into of a share of andrx common stock resulting in the issuance of approximately  shares of common stock 
the cybear conversion included a premium on the value of cybear common stock as provided by the terms of our certificate of incorporation 
subsequent to the conversion we have only one class of common stock outstanding 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including but not limited to those related to revenue recognition  including sales returns and allowances  allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  inventories and cost of goods sold  useful life or impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets  litigation settlements and related accruals  income taxes  and self insurance programs 
we base our estimates on  among other things  currently available information  our historical experience and various assumptions  which together form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
although we believe that our assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances  estimates would differ if different assumptions were utilized and these estimates may prove in the future to have been inaccurate 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  including sales returns and allowances sras andrx s distributed product revenues are revenues derived from the sale of pharmaceutical products purchased from third parties  including generic products sold on behalf of our unconsolidated joint ventures 
andrx product revenues include andrx s generic and brand product revenues 
andrx generic product revenues are revenues derived from the sale of generic products either manufactured by us pursuant to our andas or sold with our new drug code ndc  excluding generic products sold on behalf of our unconsolidated joint ventures 
andrx brand product revenues are revenues derived from the sale of branded products either manufactured by us pursuant to our nda or sold with our ndc 
revenues from our distributed products and the related cost of goods sold are recognized at the time the product is accepted by our customers 
revenues from our generic and brand products and the related cost of goods sold are recognized after products are accepted by our customers and are based on our estimate of when such products will be pulled through the distribution channel 
we do not recognize revenue and the related cost of goods sold where we believe the customer has more than a reasonable level of inventory  taking into account  among other things  historical prescription data provided by external independent sources  projected prescription data  historical purchases and demand  incentives granted to customers  customers right of return  competing product introductions and our product inventory levels in the distribution channel  all of which we periodically evaluate 
as a result  million and million of deferred revenue related to our brand business was included in the december  and consolidated balance sheets  respectively 
allowances against sales for estimated discounts  rebates  returns  chargebacks  shelf stock adjustments and other sras are established by us concurrently with the recognition of revenue 
accruals for these sras are presented in the consolidated balance sheets as reductions to accounts receivable  net or within accrued expenses and other liabilities 
our most significant sras vary depending upon the business segment 
in our distribution business  our most significant sras are for estimated returns  discounts and rebates 
sras for estimated discounts and rebates have historically been predictable and less subjective 
in our generic business  our most significant sras are for estimated discounts  customer and medicaid rebates  returns  chargebacks and shelf stock adjustments 
of these estimates  the estimates for returns  chargebacks and shelf stock adjustments are more subjective and  consequently  may be more variable 
in our brand business  our most significant sras are for estimated discounts  returns  medicaid rebates and managed care rebates 
of these estimates  the estimates for returns are more subjective and  therefore  may be more variable 
sras are established based upon consideration of a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  prescription data  inventory reports and other information received from our customers and other third parties  our customers right of return  historical information by product  the number and timing of competitive products approved for sale  both historically and as projected  the estimated size of the market for our products  current and projected economic conditions  anticipated future product pricing  future levels of prescriptions for our products and analysis that we perform 
we believe that the sales allowance accruals are reasonably determinable and are based on the information available at that time to arrive at our best estimate of the accruals 
the key assumptions we use to arrive at our best estimate of the accruals for sras are our estimates of inventory levels in the distribution channel  future price changes and potential returns  as well as historical information by product 
our estimates of prescription data  inventory at customers and in the distribution channel are subject to the inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third party data  as certain third party information may itself rely on estimates  and reflect other limitations 
actual product returns  chargebacks  shelf stock adjustments and other sras incurred are dependent upon future events 
we periodically monitor the factors that influence sras and make adjustments to these provisions when we believe that actual product returns  chargebacks  shelf stock adjustments and other sras may differ from established allowances 
if conditions in future periods change  revisions to previous estimates may be required  potentially in significant amounts 
changes in the level of provisions for estimated product returns  chargebacks  shelf stock adjustments and other sras will affect revenues 
accruals for estimated rebates and discounts are estimated based on historical payment experience  historical relationship to revenues and contractual arrangements 
we believe that such accruals are readily determinable due to the limited number of assumptions involved and the consistency of historical experience 
as discussed below  accruals for estimated returns  chargebacks  and shelf stock adjustments involve more subjective judgments and are more complex in nature 
returns consistent with industry practice  we maintain a return policy that allows our customers to return product within a specified period both prior and subsequent to the product s expiration date 
our estimate of the provision for returns is based upon our historical experience with actual returns and estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel 
we periodically monitor the factors that influence our provision for returns and make adjustments to the provision when we believe that actual product returns may differ from our established reserves 
these adjustments may occur over a prolonged period of time 
in our distribution business  our return allowances as a percentage of gross sales were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
if our distribution return allowances as a percentage of gross revenues were to differ by from our estimates  our distribution business return allowances for the year ended december  would change by  in our generic product business  our return allowances as a percentage of gross sales were  and  for the years ended december   and respectively 
if our generic return allowances as a percentage of gross revenues were to differ by from our estimates  our generic business return allowances for the year ended december  would change by  in our brand product business  our return allowances  excluding market withdrawals and recalls  as a percentage of gross sales were and  for the years ended december  and respectively 
if our brand return allowances as a percentage of gross revenues were to differ by from our estimates  our brand business return allowances for the year ended december  would change by  chargebacks we enter into agreements with certain pharmacy chains and other customers to establish contract pricing for certain of our products  which these entities purchase from the wholesaler of their choice 
alternatively  we enter into agreements with certain wholesalers to establish contract pricing for certain products that the wholesaler will agree to place in their preferential pricing programs 
under either form of agreement  we will provide our customers with a credit  known as a chargeback  for an amount equal to the difference between our agreed upon contract price and the price we previously invoiced to the wholesaler 
the provision for chargebacks is based on our estimate of wholesaler inventory levels  and the expected sell through of our products by the wholesalers at the contract price  based on historical chargeback experience and other factors 
our estimates of inventory levels at the wholesalers are subject to inherent limitations  as they rely on third party data  and their data may itself rely on estimates  and be subject to other limitations 
we periodically monitor the factors that influence our provision for chargebacks  and make adjustments when we believe that actual chargebacks may differ from established allowances 
these adjustments occur in a relatively short period of time 
as of december   our chargeback accrual as a percentage of our estimate of generic product inventory levels at wholesalers was  based on historical experience  our estimate of wholesaler inventory levels and the expected sell through of our generic products by the wholesalers at the contract price 
in  the accrual as a percentage of our estimate of generic product inventory levels at wholesalers has ranged from to 
if actual chargeback rates as a percentage of the inventory levels at wholesalers or our estimate of wholesaler inventory levels were to differ by from the rates or levels used in our provision estimate  the impact on our chargeback accrual as of december  would be  shelf stock adjustments shelf stock adjustments are inventory credits we issue to our customers to reflect decreases in the selling prices of our generic products 
these adjustments are based upon the amount of product that our customers have remaining in their inventories at the time we decide to reduce the selling price of our product  generally as a result of market conditions  and not pursuant to contractual arrangements with customers 
these inventory credits allow customers with existing inventories to compete with those buying product at the current market price  and allows us to maintain shelf space  market share and customer loyalty 
amounts recorded for estimated shelf stock adjustments are based on estimated launch dates of competing products  estimated declines in market price and estimates of inventory held by the customer 
these estimates are subject to inherent limitations  as they both rely on third party data and our judgment of the likelihood of future events and the likely impact of those events 
we periodically monitor these and other factors that influence our provision for shelf stock adjustments and make adjustments when we believe that actual shelf stock adjustments may differ from established allowances 
as of december   our generic business shelf stock adjustment accrual is based on estimated declines in market price by product ranging from to and estimated levels of inventory at customers by product ranging from approximately one month to two and one half months on average 
if actual declines in market price were to differ by on average from our estimates  the impact on our generic business shelf stock adjustment accrual as of december  would be million 
if actual levels of inventory at customers were to differ by from our estimates  the impact on our generic business shelf stock adjustment accrual as of december  would be  in our brand business  there are a limited number of large customers 
these customers may attempt to modify the terms by which we have historically done business  such as through the imposition of service fees and or additional concessions 
during the years ended december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of our brand product shipments were made to four customers 
when other parties market our products or when we are entitled to revenues from the sale of their products  we recognize revenue based on information supplied by the other parties related to shipment to  and their customers acceptance of  the products  less estimates for sras 
we receive periodic reports from the other parties that support the amount of revenue we recognize  and amounts recognized are then compared to the cash subsequently remitted to us 
the revenues we report are subject to several estimates  similar to those we experience with the sales of our products 
we periodically monitor the factors that influence sras and conduct inquiries of the other parties regarding these estimates 
such estimates are revised as changes become known 
when we receive licensing and royalties revenues  we recognize those revenues when the obligations associated with the earning of that revenue have been satisfied  based upon the terms of the contract 
if obligations associated with the earning of that revenue remain  we will defer all or a portion of the payment  whether or not it is refundable  and recognize such amount over future periods after the remaining services have been rendered or delivery has occurred and the amounts are fixed or determinable 
when we enter into revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we divide the deliverables into separate units of accounting 
if there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for all units of accounting  the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units based on their relative fair values 
if there is no reliable and objective evidence of fair value for a delivered item  but there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered item s  the amount of consideration allocated to the delivered item equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of the undelivered item s 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from our inability to collect from customers 
as of december   our accounts receivable  net totaled million  including an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable of million 
accounts receivable generated from our distribution business are generally of relatively small amounts from a large number of customers 
accounts receivable generated from our generic and brand businesses are generally of relatively larger amounts and from a smaller number of customers 
in extending credit  we assess our customer s credit worthiness by  among other factors  evaluating the customer s financial condition  credit history and the amount involved  both initially and on an ongoing basis 
collateral is generally not required 
in evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  we primarily analyze accounts receivable balances  the percentage of accounts receivable by aging category  and historical bad debts and also consider  among other things  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  and changes in customer payment terms or payment patterns 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments or our ability to collect  an increase to the allowance may be required 
also  should actual collections of accounts receivable be different than our estimates included in the determination of our allowance  the allowance would be increased or decreased through charges or credits to selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in the consolidated statements of income in the period in which such changes in collection become known 
if conditions change in future periods  additional allowances or reversals may be required 
such additional allowances or reversals could be significant 
in august  we learned that an employee had made numerous improper entries that affected the aging of certain customer accounts receivable and  accordingly  the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
after extensive investigation and analysis  including discussions with certain customers regarding past due amounts  management determined that our provision for doubtful accounts receivable included in sg a was understated for the years ended  and  by an aggregate amount of million 
after consideration of all of the facts and circumstances  we recognized the full amount of the million prior period misstatement in the second quarter of  as we believed it was not material to any period affected 
activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is as follows years ended december  in thousands beginning of year provision for recoveries of allowance for doubtful accounts receivable write offs  net end of year in  our allowance for doubtful accounts benefited from a reduction in the provision for doubtful accounts due to the favorable resolution of disputed customer deductions that had been provided for in and the allowance for doubtful accounts decreased in primarily due to the write off of accounts whose collection had been deemed doubtful in the provision also benefited from the settlement of certain accounts that had been provided for in our allowance for doubtful accounts increased significantly in due to the increase in our provision for doubtful accounts as a result of the matter discussed above 
inventories and cost of goods sold inventories consist primarily of finished goods held for distribution  and raw materials  work in process and finished goods of our generic and brand products 
as of december   we had million in inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
we evaluate lower of cost or market separately for commercial and pre launch inventories 
cost of inventories held for distribution is based on purchase price  net of vendor discounts  rebates and other allowances  but excludes shipping  warehousing and distribution costs  which are expensed as incurred and reported as sg a expenses 
in evaluating whether inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  management considers such factors as the amount of inventory on hand and in the distribution channel  the estimated time required to sell such inventory  remaining shelf life and current and expected market conditions  including levels of competition 
as appropriate  provisions through cost of goods sold are made to reduce inventories to their net realizable value 
if conditions change in future periods  additional allowances may be required 
such additional allowances could be significant 
pre launch inventories from time to time  we have made  are in the process of making or may make commercial quantities of our product candidates prior to the date that we anticipate that such products will receive fda final marketing approval and or satisfactory resolution of the patent infringement litigation  if any  involving them ie pre launch inventories 
each of our anda submissions is made with the expectation that i the fda will approve the marketing of the product therein described  ii we will validate our process for manufacturing that anda product within the specifications that have been or will be approved by the fda for such product  iii we will prevail in any patent infringement litigation involving our anda product  and iv a future economic benefit will be derived from the commercialization of our anda product 
all of these expectations are reconfirmed in connection with our determination to build pre launch quantities of that product  and to capitalize such cost as inventory 
there are typically few risks and uncertainties concerning market acceptance of our approved generic products because the brand product has an established demand  and our lower priced product may be substituted for that referenced brand product 
therefore  we will generally seek to have launch quantities of our product available for shipment on the day we obtain the ability to prudently market our product ie  without undue patent infringement or other risks 
this requires us to  among other things  begin to validate our manufacturing processes in accordance with fda regulations well before the date we anticipate our product will be approved  and may entail a scale up process 
the scale up process allows us to modify the equipment and processes employed in the manufacture of our product to increase our manufacturing lot sizes 
scale up activities are expensed  including the raw material used in such activities 
direct and indirect manufacturing costs incurred during the manufacture of the validation lots which are permitted to be sold as well as the manufacture of additional product to meet estimated launch demand are capitalized 
in evaluating whether it is probable that we will derive future economic benefits from our pre launch inventories and whether the pre launch inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  we take into consideration  among other things  the remaining shelf life of that inventory  the current and expected market conditions  the amount of inventory on hand  the substance of communications with the fda during the regulatory approval process and the views of patent and or litigation counsel 
we also consider potential alternative uses for our pre launch inventories that are in the form of raw material  such as returning those materials to the vendor  and or reselling them to other companies 
as appropriate  provisions through cost of goods sold are made to reduce pre launch inventories to their net realizable value 
production of pre launch inventories involves the risk that fda may not approve such product s for marketing on a timely basis  if ever  that each approval may require additional or different testing and or specifications than what was performed in the manufacture of such pre launch inventory  and or that the results of related litigation may not be satisfactory 
if this risk were to materialize or the launch of such product is significantly postponed  additional allowances may be required 
such additional allowances could be material 
generally  pre launch inventories related to publicly disclosed product candidates are separately identified except in circumstances which we believe would place us at a competitive disadvantage to do so 
as of december  and  we had pre launch inventories pending final fda approval and or satisfactory resolution of litigation broken down as follows december  in thousands raw materials work in process finished goods pre launch inventories as of december  consist primarily of our generic version of concerta  which we currently believe will receive final fda approval in pre launch inventories as of december  include million of our generic version of concerta and products approved and or launched subsequent to december  shelf lives of pre launch inventories generally exceed one year 
charges to cost of goods sold the following table summarizes charges to cost of goods sold associated with production related write offs  write offs of pre launch inventories  impairment charges  and under utilization and inefficiencies related to the manufacture of our products and product candidates years ended december  in thousands production related write offs write offs of pre launch inventories impairment charges north carolina facility entex product rights massachusetts facility  inventory and severance florida machinery and equipment under utilization and inefficiencies of manufacturing operations florida and north carolina facilities massachusetts aerosol facility production related write offs represent inventory write offs at our manufacturing facilities 
for the year ended december   write offs of pre launch inventories included million of our generic version of concerta as a result of the delay caused by a citizen petition filed with fda and changes in the in process testing that were subsequently required by fda and million of our generic version of accupril as a result of raw material issues 
for the year ended december   write offs of pre launch inventories primarily related to our generic versions of wellbutrin sr zyban which was not approved by fda because of expiration dating issues  placed into production in for the year ended december   write offs of pre launch inventories included a million charge for our generic versions of prilosec as a result of an adverse district court decision and a million charge related to our generic versions of wellbutrin sr zyban which was not approved by fda because of expiration dating issues see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
useful life or impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets goodwill under the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions  goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
as of december   we had million of goodwill consisting of million from the acquisition of valmed pharmaceuticals  inc in march and million from the acquisition of ctex pharmaceuticals  inc in january the ctex goodwill is included in assets held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets 
goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment in value by applying a fair value based test 
any applicable impairment loss is the amount  if any  by which the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value 
accordingly  if there is a change in the value of the goodwill we acquired  impairment charges may be required 
such additional charges could be significant 
in the event that we integrate an acquired business unit into our other operations  as we did with ctex into our brand business  the acquired business and its related goodwill are combined with our other operations  and the potential impairment is evaluated in relation to the business unit as a whole 
other intangible assets product rights acquired from other pharmaceutical companies  either separately or through an allocation of the price paid for the acquisition of an entity included in other intangible assets  are being amortized over a period ranging from two to eight years 
other intangible assets also include patents relating to electronic prescription processes  which are being amortized over a period of years 
we established these amortization periods based on our estimate of the period the assets would generate positive cash flows 
if conditions change  we may decrease the estimated amortization period 
amortization is provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful life 
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if conditions in future periods change  additional allowances may be required  which could be significant 
as of december   we had million of other intangible assets  net which consisted primarily of million related to patents for our electronic prescription process and million and million for product rights related to the entex and anexsia product lines  respectively 
additionally  we had million for product rights related to fortamet classified as assets held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet 
impairment charges in june  we recorded a million write down of our north carolina facility as a result of our june determination that we would discontinue renovation of our north carolina facility 
as we believe that it is more likely than not that this facility will be sold  we reduced the carrying value of this facility to an amount equal to its estimated fair value based on independent appraisals  resulting in a million impairment charge to cost of goods sold 
as a result of the fda approval of an nda for an otc product containing the same active ingredients as our entex pse prescription product  we recorded a charge of million to cost of goods sold related to the impairment of our entex product rights in june  representing the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the entex product rights based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
according to fda guidance  once the fda approves a version of any product that is presently permitted to be on the market and sold by prescription without an approved anda or nda  similar unapproved drug products  such as our entex product line  may be subject to fda action 
it is unclear whether fda will permit a grace period for the continued sale of entex pse or  if granted  how long such grace period will be 
as a result of the uncertain continued viability of our entex line of products  including entex la  we changed the amortization of our entex product rights from its original year period on a straight line basis 
in july  we began amortizing the remaining carrying amount of our entex product rights over months and the amortization expense related to our entex product rights increased by million to million on an annual basis 
we will continue to periodically assess the unamortized portion of our entex product rights and inventories million and  respectively  as of december  and the useful life of our entex product rights whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of our entex product rights may not be recoverable 
as a result of our determinations to no longer commit additional resources and divest our massachusetts aerosol manufacturing operation  in and  we recorded to cost of goods sold charges of million and million  respectively  related to an excess facilities lease  related leasehold improvements  excess aerosol product inventories  and equipment and severance at that operation  which we sold in october we recorded a charge of million for the impairment of goodwill and certain intangible assets related to physicians online pol in that charge was the result of our belief that the future benefits previously associated with this transaction no longer existed following our decision to not commit additional resources to pol  to seek the sale of pol and our evaluation of the goodwill and intangible assets arising from the acquisition of mediconsult and its subsequent integration into andrx 
in december  we sold our pol web portal operations for million 
assets and liabilities held for sale we utilize the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which requires a long lived asset or a disposal group to be disposed of by sale to be classified as held for sale when all of the criteria for a qualifying plan of sale are met and to measure the long lived asset or disposal group at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
at the end of  our board of directors approved a plan to divest  or seek other strategic alternatives for our brand pharmaceutical business  which is primarily a sales and marketing organization with a limited number of products 
the assets and liabilities of the brand pharmaceutical business to be divested pursuant to this plan which does not include our entex and anexsia product lines have been measured at the lower of their carrying amounts or fair value less costs to sell and have been classified as assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale  respectively  in our december  and consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   we have ceased depreciating and amortizing the long lived assets included in assets held for sale 
litigation settlements and related accruals we account for the exposure of our various litigation matters under the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  which requires  among other things  an exposure to be accrued with a charge to our consolidated statements of income when it becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
no accrual or disclosure of legal exposures judged to be remote is required 
the exposure to legal matters is evaluated and estimated  if possible  following consultation with legal counsel 
such estimates are based on currently available information and  given the subjective nature and complexities inherent in making these estimates  the ultimate outcome of our legal matters may be significantly different than the amounts estimated 
we disclose possible significant exposure for legal matters in note and litigation settlements and other charges in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
our litigation related charges were million in  primarily consisting of settlement costs related to the kos pharmaceuticals trademark litigation and the alpharma uspd inc breach of contract litigation  million in  including the negotiated settlement of an obligation to one of our law firms with respect to our generic version of tiazac  and million in  which was our estimate of the amount required to reach a settlement of our cardizem cd antitrust litigation 
income taxes the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  require  among other things  recognition of future tax benefits measured at enacted rates attributable to the deductible temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and to benefit deferred tax assets to the extent that the realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
as of december   we had deferred income tax assets totaling million  of which  pertains to the brand business to be divested and is included in assets held for sale 
we have considered our ability to carry back certain net operating losses  future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and have determined that no valuation allowance is necessary on our deferred income tax assets 
in the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred income tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to the consolidated statement of income in the period such determination was made 
our future effective tax rate is based on estimates of expected income and enacted statutory tax rates  as applied to our operations 
significant judgment is required in making these determinations and the ultimate resolution of our tax return positions 
despite our belief that our tax return positions are correct  our policy is to establish accruals for tax contingencies that may result from examinations by tax authorities 
our income tax return reflected a significant tax loss as the result of certain ordinary business developments 
we believe the loss is appropriate and deductible 
nevertheless  we have recorded an accrual  which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets  to fully offset the resulting and income tax benefits of approximately million and million  respectively 
the remaining federal loss carryforward of approximately million tax effected  may be available to reduce certain future taxable income  which at that time may be similarly offset by an accrual for financial reporting purposes 
the irs has begun an audit of our tax return and will likely challenge the tax loss 
as of december   the accrual for this tax loss was million and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
if the irs were to prevail  we would be required to pay an amount up to the accrual  which will include interest at the statutory rate 
if we were to prevail or settle this issue with the irs  we would reverse all or a portion of the accrual  reduce income tax expenses accordingly  and pay the irs the settlement amount  if any  including interest at the statutory rate 
the irs is in the process of concluding its audit for the years through during those years  despite our belief that our tax return positions were correct  we established accruals for tax contingencies that may become payable in the event our positions are not upheld 
during  the irs proposed a settlement of certain matters related to this audit  to which we agreed  and we reversed million of tax accruals related to these contingencies 
as of december   we had remaining accrued tax contingencies of million included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
our tax accruals are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant such adjustment 
it is reasonably possible that our effective tax rate and or cash flows may be materially impacted by the ultimate resolution of our tax positions 
self insurance programs we maintain self insured retentions and deductibles for some of our insurance programs and limit our exposure to claims by maintaining stop loss and or aggregate liability coverages 
the estimate of our claims liability  which may be material  is subject to inherent limitations as it relies on our judgment of the likely ultimate costs that will be incurred to settle reported claims and unreported claims for incidents incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date 
when estimating our liability for such claims  we consider a number of factors  including  but not limited to  self insured retentions  deductibles  historical claim experience  demographic factors  severity factors and maximum claims exposure 
if actual claims exceed these estimates  additional charges may be required

in  revenues from distributed products generated million of gross profit with a gross margin of  compared to million of gross profit with a gross margin of for when we participate in the distribution of generic products that face little or no competition  we generally generate higher sales revenues and lower gross margins 
when such products encounter additional competition  the resulting lower prices generally cause us to generate lower revenues  but higher gross margins  as we generally are able to purchase such products at more competitive prices 
andrx products generic products for  revenues from our generic products increased by to million  compared to million in our generic product sales include sales of controlled release products and immediate release and niche generic products 
revenues from our generic controlled release products were million for  compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase of million from the inclusion of a full year of revenues of certain products launched in  including generic versions of glucotrol xl supplied by pfizer and launched in november  otc generic claritin d launched in june  and tiazac launched in april 
revenues from controlled release products launched in were million  while revenues from existing controlled release products decreased by million

cost of goods sold in and included royalties accrued related to revenues from our generic version of cardizem cd 
we recorded a million write down of our north carolina facility as a result of our june determination that we would discontinue renovation of our north carolina facility 
as we believe that it is more likely than not that this facility will be sold  we reduced the carrying value of this facility to an amount equal to its estimated fair value based on independent appraisals  resulting in a million impairment charge to cost of goods sold 
in  we recorded charges directly to cost of goods sold of million as a result of production related write offs  million related to write offs of pre launch inventories  and million for under utilization and inefficiencies at our manufacturing facilities 
in  we recorded charges directly to cost of goods sold of million as a result of production related write offs  million related to write offs of pre launch inventories  million for under utilization and inefficiencies at our manufacturing facilities  and a million write off of certain machinery and equipment  a significant portion of which related to the manufacture of generic prilosec  which we did not launch 
we expect to continue to experience significant charges to cost of goods sold as a result of production related write offs  excess capacity and inefficiencies at our manufacturing facilities 
many of these charges relate to the expansion of our manufacturing facilities in anticipation of new product launches and other factors  as well as the cost of maintaining the north carolina facility 
the decrease in gross margin from our generic products for  compared to  resulted primarily from the inclusion of sales from generic versions of glucotrol xl and paxil  supplied by pfizer and genpharm  respectively  which generate lower gross margins than our other generic products  as well as the charges to cost of goods sold discussed above 
pursuant to our agreement  our profit share from perrigo s sales of our otc claritin products decreased in as a result of additional competitors entering the market 
brand products for  revenues from our brand products increased by million or to million  from million in the increase was primarily attributable to altoprev  whose revenues increased by million  both as a result of increases in unit volume million and price million  as well as revenues of million from fortamet  which was launched in may  and million in increased revenues from the entex product line primarily due to the introduction of reformulated versions of two entex products in november sras as a percentage of gross revenues increased by to from in the increase was primarily attributable to increased returns allowances of as a percentage of gross revenues and increased medicaid rebates of as a percentage of gross revenues 
the increase in returns allowances as a percentage of gross revenues was mainly due to increased provisions for returns of our cholesterol lowering product as a result of the name change to altoprev in june  the effect of which was partially offset by the impact of higher provisions for returns of entex products in associated with the introduction of reformulated versions of two entex products in november the increase in medicaid rebates as a percentage of gross revenues was mainly due to additional rebate agreements in and the january price increases of our altoprev product  which increased the prescribed rebates payable to state medicaid agencies 
the level of altoprev in the distribution channel was approximately four months as of december   compared to normal historical levels of approximately two months  primarily due to a slight reduction in prescription levels and fewer pharmacies carrying the product since its name was changed in june  combined with year end buying by certain wholesalers in anticipation of potential price increases 
consistent with our revenue recognition accounting policy  we deferred revenue recognition related to altoprev in the amount of million at december  the level of fortamet in the distribution channel was approximately three months as of december  there were no deferred revenues related to fortamet at december  in  our brand products generated million of gross profit with a gross margin of  compared to million of gross profit with a gross margin of for the million increase in gross profit for generally resulted from a million increase in gross profit from altoprev  and million in gross profit from fortamet  which was launched in may  partially offset by a million impairment charge for our entex product rights  and approximately million in increased charges directly to cost of goods sold mainly for inventory write offs related to production and product expiration issues 
cost of goods sold in included royalties accrued related to revenues from fortamet and the entex product lines  as well as amortization of the product rights we acquired for those products 
cost of goods sold in included royalties accrued related to revenues from the entex product line  as well as amortization of our entex product rights 
in june  as a result of fda approval of an nda for an otc product containing the same active ingredients as our entex pse prescription product  we recorded a charge of million to cost of goods sold related to the impairment of our entex product rights 
this charge represented the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the entex product rights based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
according to fda guidance  once fda approves a version of any product that is presently permitted to be on the market and sold by prescription without an approved anda or nda  similar unapproved drug products  such as our entex product line  may be subject to fda action 
it is unclear whether fda will permit a grace period for the continued sale of entex pse or  if granted  how long such grace period will be 
in addition  though we have historically amortized our entex product rights over a year period on a straight line basis  the continued viability of the entex line of products  including entex la  is now uncertain 
as a result  in july  we began amortizing the remaining carrying amount of our entex product rights over months and the amortization expense related to our entex product rights increased by million to million on an annual basis 
we will continue to periodically assess the unamortized portion of our entex product rights and inventories million and  respectively  as of december  and the useful life of our entex product rights whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of our entex product rights may not be recoverable 
the decrease in gross margin from our brand products for  compared to  resulted primarily from the charges to cost of goods sold  the increase in the entex product rights amortization due to the reduction of the remaining amortization period to months effective july   and the launch of fortamet 
fortamet carries a lower gross margin due to our annual guaranteed minimum royalty to sandoz  million in year one  and the amortization of the related product rights  on a straight line basis  over the three year market exclusivity period it was granted by fda 
licensing and royalties revenue in  we recorded million in licensing and royalties revenue  compared to million in this million decrease resulted primarily from a million decrease in licensing and royalties revenue associated with generic prilosec  partially offset by million in licensing and royalties revenue associated with generic wellbutrin sr zyban 
generic wellbutrin sr zyban pursuant to our july exclusivity agreement with impax and teva  in march and may  we relinquished our rights to the day period of market exclusivity for generic wellbutrin sr mg and generic zyban  respectively 
teva launched impax s generic wellbutrin sr and zyban products in the first and second quarters of respectively  which entitled us to receive a share of the profits  as defined  derived from teva s sale of generic wellbutrin sr mg and zyban until september and november  respectively 
such profits are subject to numerous estimates for discounts  returns  chargebacks  rebates  shelf stock adjustments and other sras and related expenses 
generic prilosec pursuant to our october commercialization agreement with kudco  in exchange for relinquishing our exclusivity rights to the mg and mg strengths of generic prilosec  we receive licensing revenue from kudco s net profits  as defined  derived from kudco s sale of its generic version of prilosec 
such profits are subject to numerous estimates for discounts  returns  chargebacks  rebates  shelf stock adjustments  and other sras and related expenses

our income tax return reflected a significant tax loss as the result of certain ordinary business developments 
we believe the loss is appropriate and deductible 
nevertheless  we have recorded an accrual  which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets  to fully offset the resulting and income tax benefits of approximately million and million  respectively 
the remaining federal loss carryforward of approximately million tax effected  may be available to reduce certain future taxable income  which at that time may be similarly offset by an accrual for financial reporting purposes 
the irs has begun an audit of our tax return and will likely challenge the tax loss 
as of december   the accrual for this tax loss was million and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
if the irs were to prevail  we would be required to pay an amount up to the accrual  which will include interest at the statutory rate 
if we were to prevail or settle this issue with the irs  we would reverse all or a portion of the accrual  reduce income tax expenses accordingly  and pay the irs the settlement amount  if any  including interest at the statutory rate 
our tax accruals are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant such adjustment 
it is reasonably possible that our effective tax rate and or cash flows may be materially impacted by the ultimate resolution of our tax positions 
as a result of the january termination of our supply and distribution agreement with pfizer for cardura xl  pfizer refunded million to us in february absent a significant acquisition of a product or business or other presently unforeseen circumstances  we anticipate that our existing capital resources and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to enable us to maintain our operations and meet our capital expenditure requirements and other commitments through at least the next months without drawing on our credit facility 
outlook as noted elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  investors are cautioned that all forward looking statements involve risk and uncertainties  including those identified elsewhere in this annual report under risk factors 
accordingly  investors are cautioned not to place reliance on those forward looking statements  including those made in this outlook section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
distributed products our pharmaceutical distribution business revenues have generally experienced a history of consistent  quarterly sequential growth  and we believe our revenues will continue to grow at a rate generally consistent with the growth of the overall generic industry 
revenues from these operations are affected  in large part  by our participation in the launch of new generic products by other generic manufacturers  and the commencement and extent of competition for these products and the other products we distribute 
sales prices for generic products typically decline with the onset of additional generic competition  particularly after such products are sold during an initial marketing exclusivity period 
our distributed product revenues increased in compared to  and we believe they will continue to grow in a manner consistent with the growth of the overall generic industry 
our distribution product revenues did not increase sequentially in the second and third quarters of  however  primarily because of a lack of significant new generic product introductions in those periods 
in the fourth quarter of  several significant new generic products were launched into the market  and our distribution business experienced record revenues 
according to published data  generic versions of numerous brand products having substantial annual sales are expected to be launched in the next few years 
consequently  growth in revenues will continue to be primarily a function of new generic products launched by other generic manufacturers  offset by the overall level of net price declines on existing distributed products 
our pharmaceutical distribution business competes with a number of large wholesalers that market  among other things  both brand and generic pharmaceutical products to their customers and may therefore offer broader marketing programs 
we also compete with other pharmaceutical distributors 
though the distribution of pharmaceutical products is historically a relatively low gross margin industry  competition could result in further pressure on revenues and gross margins 
our distribution business plays a significant role in the sale of our current generic products 
we believe our distribution business will continue to play a significant role in our new product launches  and can similarly benefit our collaborative partners products 
for external reporting purposes  this segment s financial results do not include its participation in the distribution of our generic products 
such revenues are classified as andrx product revenues in our consolidated statements of income 
we continue to explore various means to leverage our distribution capabilities 
andrx generic products the generic pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and selling prices are often subject to significant and rapid declines as a result of competition among existing products or new products entering the market 
in our generic sales efforts  we compete with domestic and international companies  including brand pharmaceutical companies that sell their brand product as an authorized generic through partners and or their own generic affiliates 
many of these competitors offer a wider variety of generic products to their customers  and some manufacture their products in countries such as india and china where raw materials are obtained and finished product can be manufactured at a significantly lower cost 
as the brand products patents and other bases for market exclusivity expire  generic competitors enter the marketplace and compete for market share  which generally results in a unit price decline as the number of generic competitors increases 
the timing of these price decreases is difficult to predict and can result in significantly curtailed profitability for a generic product 
revenues and gross profits from our generic products may also be affected by competition involving the corresponding brand product  including the introduction and promotion of alternative brand or otc versions of such products 
we believe that our controlled release products may face a limited number of competitors having the scientific and legal expertise to develop these products and bring them to market as compared to immediate release products 
we also believe that  for various reasons  our niche products may also face fewer competitors than most generic products 
we believe that potentially fewer competitors  combined with the synergistic value derived from our pharmaceutical distribution business  better position andrx to compete in the highly competitive generic product marketplace 
currently  our overall level of profitability remains dependent  to a great extent  on a relatively small number of products 
if these products  particularly our generic versions of cardizem cd and  to a lesser extent  tiazac  glucotrol xl supplied by pfizer and our claritin products were to experience increased competition  the resulting price reductions and or reduced market share would significantly adversely affect these products contribution to our results of operations 
fda approved an additional generic version of cardizem cd in may  which has not yet been launched  and there is an anda pending approval by the fda for a generic version of tiazac 
consequently  additional generic competition for our versions of these products could occur in early excluding the million write down of our north carolina facility in the second quarter  our generic products business experienced two consecutive quarters of declining revenues  gross profits and gross margin in the second half of  and absent introductions of significant new products  additional sequential quarterly declines in operating results are likely 
revenues and gross profits will also vary depending upon the timing and market environment related to the launch of our new products 
future growth of our generic products business will be generated from the launch of new products  particularly our generic versions of concerta  which has not been approved by fda and remains the subject of citizen petitions filed with fda  and biaxin xl which  though approved by fda  we do not plan to launch earlier than may due to patent considerations 
we are also working towards a launch  by perrigo  of our otc generic version of claritin d  which was approved in january  towards fda approval and launch of our own generic versions of glucotrol xl  so we can generate substantially greater gross margins than we presently earn from our sale of product supplied by pfizer  and the launch of other anda products awaiting approval at the fda 
there is no certainty about whether or when these andrx products will be launched 
in the event that fda does not approve certain of our product candidates or their market introduction is delayed due to other factors such as litigation and new patent listings  among others  we may need to write off all or a portion of pre launch inventories related to these product candidates 
we are also working towards acquiring additional products and increasing our margins through external efforts such as strategic alliances  collaborative agreements and acquisitions 
in some cases these efforts will result in the utilization of our sales and marketing capabilities  including those obtained through our distribution operations  to maximize the value of the generic products that other companies are seeking to market 
in other situations  we intend to have these efforts result in the development and or supply of raw material and finished products by such third party at a lower price 
these external efforts will primarily be directed towards other countries such as india and china 
we continue to invest in r d and currently have approximately andas pending at fda 
however  the launch of our generic product candidates is dependent upon a number of factors  both within and outside our control 
factors outside our control include new orange book patent listings  related patent infringement litigation and the expiration of others exclusivity rights  each of which affects the timing of our receipt of fda marketing approval  fda s resolution of citizen petitions  and the timing and outcome of our patent litigation 
the revenues and gross profits to be generated by these new products will also be affected by the amount of generic competition they encounter  once launched  particularly after the expiration of any day exclusivity period that we might have  either alone or on a shared basis  and whether there is an authorized generic product in the market 
we have made  are in the process of making or will make commercial quantities of certain new products prior to the date on which we anticipate that such products will receive fda final marketing approval and or satisfactory resolution of any patent infringement litigation involving such products 
the commercial production of these products involves the risk that such product s may not be successfully scaled up or approved for marketing by fda on a timely basis or ever and or that the outcome of such litigation may not be satisfactory 
when an exclusivity period is involved  this is a particularly difficult determination 
these risks notwithstanding  we plan to continue to scale up and build pre launch inventories of certain products that have not yet received final fda marketing approval or for which patent infringement litigation may be pending  when we believe that such action is appropriate in relation to the commercial value of the product launch opportunity 
andrx brand products at the end of  our board of directors approved a plan to divest  or seek other strategic alternatives for  our brand pharmaceutical business  realigning our business strategy and focusing on our core competencies of formulation development and marketing of generic controlled release pharmaceuticals and distribution 
we engaged banc of america securities llc to assist in the process of divesting or seeking strategic alternatives for our brand business  which is primarily a sales and marketing organization with a limited number of products 
we anticipate that this process will be completed in we believe that the brand business will continue to incur operating losses until the disposition of the business is completed 
in addition  our decision to exit the brand business and the related reduction in sales force may result in declining prescriptions and lower revenues 
on march   we entered into agreements with first horizon for the sale and licensing of certain rights and assets related to our fortamet and altoprev brand pharmaceutical products 
first horizon has agreed to pay us million for fortamet and up to million for altoprev 
the amount that we may receive from first horizon related to altoprev  if any  is contingent upon meeting and maintaining certain supply requirements  as defined 
we will also be entitled to receive royalties on net sales  as defined  of fortamet and altoprev of and  respectively 
we will retain our obligation to pay a royalty to sandoz related to fortamet subject to certain minimums and a maximum 
we have also entered into a long term manufacturing and supply arrangement for fortamet and altoprev with first horizon 
we will evaluate whether these arrangements are at fair value and defer recognition of the purchase price as appropriate  if necessary 
the computation of the amount of gain or loss on the transaction  as well as the ultimate disposition of the brand business goodwill of million  will be dependent upon the resolution of the issues described above 
the closing of the transaction  which is subject to certain customary conditions including clearance under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act  is expected to occur by may after that closing occurs  we have agreed to provide certain transitional services to first horizon for a period of time 
in connection with this divestiture of our brand business  we estimate that we will incur personnel related expenses of approximately million  including severance  performance incentives and retention 
in addition  we estimate we will incur approximately million in other costs which consist of approximately million in non cash charges primarily related to potential lease impairments as well as payments of approximately million for transaction costs and contract termination costs 
we have encountered and are experiencing manufacturing difficulties with respect to the production of altoprev 
we have engaged outside consultants to assist us in resolving these issues and are confident that they will be resolved in a timely manner 
nevertheless  these issues could result in a shortage of product that could adversely affect our future revenues from altoprev and the amount we are able to realize upon the disposition of this asset 
we are not aware of any anda filing with respect to altoprev  which has certain patents listed in the orange book 
in may  we began marketing fortamet  our second internally developed brand product  which was approved by fda in april fortamet was awarded a three year marketing exclusivity period  and we have listed certain patents in the orange book with respect to this product 
we are required to pay royalties to sandoz on sales of fortamet for a five year period  with certain guaranteed annual minimums and maximums 
though our entex line of products continues to generate significant revenues  million  million  and million in   and  respectively  the continued economic life of this line of products is uncertain 
generic versions of entex la and entex pse were introduced in the third quarter of  which will result in lower revenues and gross profit from these entex products 
moreover  as a result of the june fda approval of an nda for an otc product containing the same active ingredients as our entex pse prescription product  and fda s guidance that such action may result in the withdrawal of similar unapproved drug products from the market  it is unclear how long fda will continue to allow the sale of entex pse  and whether similar actions will occur with respect to entex la 
in july  we began amortizing the remaining carrying amount of our entex product rights over months and the amortization expense related to our entex product rights increased by million to million on an annual basis 
we will continue to periodically assess the unamortized portion of our entex product rights and inventories million and  respectively  as of december  and the useful life of our entex product rights whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of our entex product rights may not be recoverable 
future fda actions may significantly impact entex revenues  the carrying value of our entex product rights  and our decision as to whether we should retain or dispose of our entex product rights 
the entex and anexsia product lines  which generated million  million  and million in   and  respectively  are not considered part of the brand business to be divested 
in may  fda issued a tentative nda approval for our valproate sodium product 
final approval is pending expiration of a month stay approximately october  fda s response to the citizen petition filed by abbott laboratories and or favorable resolution of the patent infringement litigation filed by abbott laboratories 
pursuant to our december agreement with takeda  we have received a million milestone payment  the revenue recognition of which was deferred because the amount to be retained by us is contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events 
we are also entitled to receive significant additional milestone payments from takeda upon the occurrence of certain specified events  as well as a transfer price for product manufactured by us and a royalty and certain additional performance payments related to takeda s sale of the combination product 
net sales of any of our products will be adversely affected by generic introductions  seasonality for cough and cold brand products  and by our announced decision to divest or seek alternative strategies for our brand business  which has resulted and will likely continue to result in a reduction in the number of sales representatives promoting our brand products 
licensing and royalties revenue we presently derive licensing and royalties revenue at a rate of from our october commercialization agreement with kudco  which will end in february the amount of such revenue we receive depends upon kudco s profits from its sales of its generic version of prilosec  which amount is subject to competition and numerous estimates for discounts  returns  chargebacks  rebates  shelf stock adjustments  and other sras and related expenses 
as a result of continuing and increased competition  we anticipate that our revenues from this agreement will continue to decline in we believe we maintain a day period of market exclusivity with respect to our anda for a generic version of the mg strength of prilosec  and will continue to attempt to commercialize the value of that exclusivity period and our generic version of prilosec 
however  there are at least two pending litigation matters challenging fda s interpretation of the day exclusivity period  and the outcome of that litigation could affect our rights 
cost of goods sold our future financial performance remains dependent on our ability to manufacture sufficient product to meet the market demand for our current and anticipated products on a timely basis 
we have made various organizational changes that are intended to improve accountability  foster teamwork and improve coordination among our r d  manufacturing and quality groups and thereby better ensure the timely and uninterrupted supply of our current products and product candidates  maximize communication and reduce inefficiencies 
these changes included assigning and hiring new personnel to manage our manufacturing and quality groups  respectively  revising our process development and technical transfer processes  and establishing a project management office to manage our product line from inception to launch 
we have also implemented changes in our training program to better ensure that our manufacturing and quality employees are properly trained 
we are subject to regular inspections by fda 
any non compliance with cgmp or the corrective action plan we proposed to fda in response to the form notices issued by fda could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
see risks relating to the pharmaceuticals industry generally and to andrx specifically in this annual report on form k 
to meet the market demand for our current and anticipated products  and manufacture our products in compliance with our regulatory submissions and cgmp requirements  we continue to focus on improving the efficiency and quality of our manufacturing operations 
these efforts include  among others i optimizing our processes  thereby reducing product rejections  ii implementing quality initiatives to ensure compliance with cgmp  including laboratory information management systems  iii increasing personnel training  accountability  development and expertise  iv implementing jd edwards enterprise resource planning erp system  an integrated planning and operating system  which we accomplished in early  v evaluating the commercial viability of producing certain products that we anticipate will generate a relatively small amount of profit compared to the utilization of resources in order to allow us to optimize our output and maximize our profitability  vi transferring production or portions thereof for certain products to equipment capable of handling larger batch sizes or to third parties  including foreign contract manufacturers  and vii renovating our facilities to increase capacity and optimize production 
until all of our efforts come to fruition  we will continue to incur significant costs related to inefficiencies and excess capacity at our manufacturing facilities and production related write offs 
we also continue to incur significant costs related to inefficiencies and excess capacity at our manufacturing facilities because our products employ a variety of technology platforms and we need to prepare for our future manufacturing requirements 
this causes certain of our manufacturing capabilities to at times be over utilized  while others are under utilized and  to remedy those areas where our manufacturing facilities are over utilized  we continue to expand our manufacturing capabilities 
this expansion will result in increased unabsorbed overhead in the near future that will be charged directly to cost of goods sold 
we will also incur additional charges directly to cost of goods sold in the manufacture of our products and product commercialization activities 
as a result of all of these and other factors  we may at times have difficulty fulfilling all of the market demand for our products and having pre launch quantities of our product candidates available when we obtain fda approval to market our products 
sg a expenses our sg a expenses vary with the level of our sales and our sales product mix  which includes distributed products  our generic products and our brand products  and with changes to general and administrative activities 
sg a expenses related to our distribution business are primarily variable in nature  and change with our distribution revenues 
sg a expenses related to our generics business are relatively flat and do not vary significantly with the level of generic revenues 
sg a expenses related to our brand business generally increase or decrease as a result of our sales and marketing efforts  but will be significantly affected by our decision to divest this business 
corporate sg a expenses primarily include general and administrative expenses related to our corporate headquarters  which primarily houses our information systems  human resources  legal and corporate executive  finance and administrative functions 
it also includes amortization expense related to restricted stock units 
in connection with the divestiture of our brand business  we estimate that we will incur personnel related expenses of approximately million  including severance  performance incentives and retention 
in addition  we estimate we will incur approximately million in other costs which consist of approximately million in non cash charges primarily related to potential lease impairments as well as payments of approximately million for transaction costs and contract termination costs 
we are also reevaluating our cost structure with respect to corporate and our remaining business units to determine whether our existing infrastructure remains necessary for our current and anticipated operations 
our infrastructure realignment decisions could result in additional charges 
all of our employees have historically received a grant of stock options as part of their compensation  and beginning in  such options were to be granted on annual basis to many of our employees 
as a result of the adoption of new accounting rules requiring that such options be expensed in the first interim period that begins after june   we are in the process of modifying the manner in which we compensate our employees 
it is likely that we will curtail the issuance of stock options and increase the awarding of restricted stock units and other forms of compensation in the future 
as a result  our corporate sg a will increase in due to the expensing of stock options and anticipated increases in amortization expense related to restricted stock units 
our corporate sg a will also be affected by increased amortization expense related to the jd edwards erp system implementation 
r d expenses we anticipate that r d expenses for will total approximately million  and will focus primarily on generic r d 
r d expenses will be evaluated throughout giving consideration to  among other things  our level of profitability and development opportunities 
income taxes we believe our combined federal and state effective tax rate for will be approximately 
however  we are currently under audit by the irs for the years through despite our belief that our tax return positions are correct  it is our policy to establish accruals for tax contingencies that may result from examinations by tax authorities 
while it is difficult to predict the final outcome of any particular tax matter  we believe our tax accruals are adequate 
the tax accruals are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant such adjustment 
it is reasonably likely that our effective tax rate and or cash flows may be materially impacted by the ultimate resolution of our tax positions 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our tax accruals 
earnings guidance our policy is not to provide specific earnings projections or guidance  and not to comment on research analyst reports  including earnings estimates or consensus 
through public disclosures such as our press releases and periodic sec reports  including this form k  we attempt to provide sufficient disclosure of both our current status and future prospects  using the safe harbor provision for forward looking statements prescribed in the private securities litigation reform act of  to allow the investment community to properly evaluate us and our prospects for performance 
there can be no assurance that research analysts in using publicly available information will generate research reports or earnings estimates consistent with our actual internal plan or that such estimates will not vary significantly from analyst to analyst 
accordingly  even if we execute our own plans  our actual performance may be substantially different than what is reflected in any individual research analyst s reports or earnings estimate or the consensus of such estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements inventory costs in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial accounting standards no 
 inventory costs sfas  amending the guidance in accounting research bulletin arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing by clarifying the accounting for certain items 
sfas clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges  and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june   however  earlier application is permitted

sfas no

public companies will be required to apply the provisions of sfas no 
r as of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we have accelerated the vesting of out of the money unvested stock options  in accordance with apb opinion no 
there can be no assurance that the acceleration of the vesting of these options will not result in some future compensation expense 
we will begin to expense the remaining in the money unvested stock options awarded to acquire approximately  shares of andrx common stock in our first interim reporting period that begins after june   in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
we have estimated that the compensation expense to be recognized related to these options  assuming no forfeitures and no additional grants  will be approximately million  of which million  million   and  will be expensed in    and thereafter  respectively 
it is likely that we will curtail the issuance of stock options and increase the awarding of restricted stock units and other forms of compensation in the future 
once the provisions of sfas no 
r go into effect  our employee stock purchase plan will also be treated as compensatory 
we cannot estimate the compensation expense that will be recognized in connection with our employee stock purchase plan because such expense will depend on the number of employees participating in the plan  our stock price  and other factors 
had sfas no 
r been in effect in  the compensation expense recognized in connection with our employee stock purchase plan would have been immaterial to our results of operations 
accounting for income taxes the american jobs creation act of in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of 
fsp fas states that the qualified production activities deduction under the american jobs creation act of be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with fas  and not as a rate reduction 
a special deduction is accounted for by recording the benefit of the deduction in the year in which it can be taken in the company s tax return  and not by adjusting deferred taxes in the period of enactment 
fsp fas was effective upon issuance 
as a result of fsp fas and the american jobs creation act of  we expect that our effective income tax rate will be reduced  however  we cannot quantify the impact of such rate reduction as we are awaiting implementation guidance from the us treasury department and the irs 
litigation see note of notes to consolidated financial statements item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we invest cash balances in excess of operating requirements in cash equivalents and marketable securities  generally money market funds  corporate debt  us and government agency securities  state  municipal and local agency securities  and auction rate securities with an average maturity of approximately one and a half years 
in  a committee of our board of directors approved the extension of the maximum maturity of our investments from two to three years with the average life of the portfolio increasing from to months 
our investments are investment grade securities and deposits are with investment grade financial institutions 
all marketable securities are considered available for sale 
the primary objective of our cash investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our invested cash without significantly increasing risk of loss 
the marketable securities we hold are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
however  because of the short term nature of the marketable securities  we do not believe that interest rate fluctuations would materially impair the principal amount of our investments 
we also believe that the realization of material losses due to a change in interest rates is unlikely due to the relatively short term nature  the diversity and the credit quality of our investments 
during the years ended december  and  the effects of changes in interest rates on the fair market value of our marketable investment securities and our earnings were not material 
further  we believe that the impact on the fair market value of our securities and our earnings from a hypothetical change in interest rates would not be significant 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility are also interest rate sensitive  because the applicable rate varies with changes in the prime rate of lending or the average eurodollar rate 
we had no amounts outstanding under this credit facility during and if we incur indebtedness under our credit facility in the future  we cannot ensure that interest rate fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we have operated primarily in the united states 
accordingly  we do not have any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations
