the average cost method attaches a cost to each item and is a blended average is the original purchase price and those of subsequent purchases or other cost adjustments throughout the life cycle of that item 
inventory valuation requires significant judgment and estimates  including obsolescence  shrink and any adjustments to market value  if market value is lower than cost 
inherent in the entertainment software industry is the risk of obsolete inventory 
typically  newer releases generate a higher product demand 
some vendors offer credits to reduce the cost of products that are selling more slowly  thus allowing for a reduction in the selling price and reducing the possibility for items to become obsolete 
the company records obsolescence and any adjustments to market value if lower than cost based on current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  and market conditions 
the provision for inventory shrink is estimated as a percentage of sales for the period from the last date a physical inventory was performed to the end of the fiscal year 
such estimates are based on historical results and trends  and the shrink results from the last physical inventory 
physical inventories are taken at least annually for all stores throughout the year  and inventory records are adjusted accordingly

the level of merchandise return charges incurred is directly related to the level of merchandise returns

factors that the company considers to be important when assessing impairment include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the use of acquired assets or the strategy for the company s overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in stock price for a sustained period  and market capitalization relative to net book value 
when the company determines that the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable based on one or more of the above indicators  the company tests for impairment to determine if an impairment charge is needed 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment under the provisions of sfas no 
the company used a two step impairment assessment to determine if an impairment charge was needed 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compared the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit had exceeded its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit would have been considered not impaired  and the second step of the impairment test would not have been necessary 
since the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test was performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
the company tested goodwill pursuant to sfas no 
as of the end of and determined that all of its recorded goodwill was impaired 
accordingly a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million was recorded in loss from operations during the fourth quarter of this impairment charge resulted from operating profits and cash flows being lower than expected during the second half of based on this trend  the earnings forecasts of the company were revised 
given the then existing retail music industry conditions  including cd piracy  management lowered its near term expectations for its business resulting in the impairment charge 
the then current fair values of the company s reporting units were based on the present expectations for these businesses 
a discounted cash flow model based upon the company s weighted average cost of capital  and other widely accepted valuation techniques  including market multiple analyses  were used to determine the fair value of the company s reporting units for purposes of testing goodwill impairment

the amount of vendor allowances to be recorded as a reduction of merchandise inventory is determined by calculating the ratio of vendor allowances in excess of specific  incremental and identifiable advertising and promotional costs to merchandise inventory purchases 
this ratio is then applied to the value of merchandise inventory to determine the amount of vendor reimbursements that are recorded as a reduction to merchandise inventory as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at january   and january  the company adopted the new guidance related to this method of accounting for cooperative advertising and certain other vendor allowances effective from the beginning of fiscal  resulting in a one time  non cash charge of million  net of income taxes of million

historically  the company accounted for these allowances as reductions to the related leasehold improvements on its consolidated balance sheets and as a reduction of related investing activities on its consolidated statements of cash flows 
management revised its method of accounting for these allowances to record them as deferred credits on its consolidated balance sheets and as a component of operating activities on its consolidated statements of cash flows 
the net  unamortized allowances recorded in the january  consolidated balance sheets is million  of which million is reflected under deferred rent and other long term liabilities and million is reflected in accrued expenses 
the cumulative adjustment to the consolidated statement of earnings for fiscal as result of the revision was to decrease net income by million
