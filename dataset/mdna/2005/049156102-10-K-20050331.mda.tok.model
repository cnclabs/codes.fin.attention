item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading us manufacturer of high quality specialty plastic films and custom molded and extruded plastic products used for storage and transportation  food service  appliance  automotive  commercial and consumer applications 
we currently operate manufacturing facilities  and we believe we are a low cost producer in many of our product lines 
we operate through three operating business segments plastic films  injection molding and profile extrusion 
plastic films  which accounted for approximately of our net sales in  is a leading manufacturer of specialty plastic films 
plastic films is comprised of three operating divisions stretch films  custom films and institutional products 
stretch films produces high quality  multilayer plastic films that are used to cover  package and protect products for storage and transportation applications 
we believe we are one of the largest producers of stretch films in the united states 
custom films produces customized monolayer and multilayer specialty plastic films used as a substrate in multilayer laminates in foam padding for carpet  automotive and medical applications  and as industrial and protective packaging 
institutional products converts custom films into disposable products such as tablecovers  gloves and aprons  which are used primarily in institutional food service 
injection molding  which accounted for approximately of our net sales in  is a leading manufacturer of both custom and proprietary injection molded products 
injection molding produces a number of custom injection molded components that are sold primarily to original equipment manufacturers in the home appliance  automotive parts  recreational vehicle and construction industries 
injection molding also manufactures a line of proprietary plastic cedar shake siding panels for the home building industry and residential replacement market under the cedarway trade name 
profile extrusion  which accounted for approximately of our net sales in  is a manufacturer of custom extruded plastic products  primarily for use in consumer and commercial products  including recreational vehicles  mobile homes  residential doors and windows  office furniture and appliances 
we believe we are one of the leading manufacturers of custom extruded plastic products for recreational vehicles 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
note to our consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of these financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements also requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  our management evaluates these estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  intangible assets  sales returns and allowances  bad debts and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable we recognize revenue upon shipment of our products to customers  giving consideration to product shipping terms 
receivables are currently due from customers based on negotiated payment terms 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded based on specific review and analysis of customer account balances and historical trends 
the allowance for sales returns is recorded based on management s estimate of product returns  primarily based on historical trends 
we perform ongoing credit assessments of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history  the customer s current credit worthiness and any other relevant customer specific credit information 
while historical credit losses have been within our expectations and the provisions established  it is possible that future credit losses could be higher or lower 

table of contents inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
cost includes materials  labor and overhead 
market  with respect to all inventories  is replacement cost or net realizable value 
management periodically reviews inventory to determine the necessity of reserves for excess  obsolete or unsaleable inventory 
these reviews require management to assess customer and market demand 
these estimates may differ from actual results  in which case we may have overstated or understated the reserve required for excess  obsolete or unsaleable inventory 
goodwill we review goodwill and identifiable intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of the goodwill or identifiable intangible assets below their carrying value 
an impairment loss would be recognized based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its estimated fair value  which would be determined based on either discounted future cash flows or other appropriate valuation methods 
specifically  we have net goodwill  which represents the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities of acquired businesses  of million and accumulated amortization of million at december  net goodwill and accumulated amortization were million and million  respectively  at december  based upon our analysis  we have determined there has been no impairment of goodwill as of december  in accordance with sfas although we currently believe that the estimates of each reporting unit s fair value used in the evaluation of goodwill are reasonable  differences between actual and expected revenue  operating results  and cash flow could cause these assets to be deemed impaired 
if this were to occur  we would be required to charge to earnings the write down in value of such assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
self insurance we are self insured for the majority of our group health insurance costs  subject to specific retention levels 
the reserve for health insurance claims incurred but not paid is based on historical claims information 
in addition  we are self insured for the majority of our worker s compensation costs 
we establish reserves for worker s compensation claims utilizing insurance industry loss development factors as well as specific estimates of settlement costs for individual claims 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may have a material effect on our group health insurance and worker s compensation costs

table of contents liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of outstanding indebtedness  million in cash and cash equivalents  and an additional million of unused availability under the then existing credit facility  net of outstanding letters of credit of approximately million 
substantially all of our accounts receivable  inventories and property and equipment were pledged as collateral under this credit facility 
our principal needs for liquidity  on both a short and long term basis  relate to working capital principally accounts receivable and inventories  debt service  and capital expenditures 
our working capital  defined as current assets less current liabilities  at december  totaled million including cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to million including cash and cash equivalents of million at december  on november   we acquired the business and certain assets and also assumed certain specific liabilities of lavanture plastics extrusion technologies  inc  and molded designs technology  inc  collectively lavanture 
lavanture manufactures profile extruded and injection molded plastic products primarily for oems in the recreational vehicle industry 
the purchase price of million was funded by borrowings in connection with an amendment to our credit facility 
the amendment  effective november   increased the availability of our credit facility from million to million  and increased the amount drawn by million 
the amendment also changed certain covenants of our credit facility  including the maximum funded debt to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  capital expenditure limitation  and minimum ebitda requirements 
we have also recorded a holdback reserve of approximately  which will be paid to the former owners of lavanture upon satisfaction of outstanding previous obligations  or by june  on march   we completed the syndication of a new million secured financing provided by a syndicate of banks and financial institutions 
the new financing includes a million revolving credit facility maturing march  a million senior secured term loan facility maturing in september and a million junior secured term loan facility maturing in march substantially all of our accounts receivable  inventories and property and equipment are pledged as collateral under this credit facility 
the proceeds of the facility were used to repay our existing senior secured debt of million outstanding on march  and to pay related fees and expenses 
the remainder of the proceeds will be used to pay a special dividend to our shareholders and to provide ongoing working capital 
along with the special dividend payment  we will pay approximately million to holders of outstanding stock options in exchange for the cancellation of these options on the date the dividend is paid 
see below for further discussion 
in conjunction with the cancellation of our previous credit facility  we will expense approximately million of deferred financing costs associated with the old facility during the first quarter of fiscal additionally  we will expense approximately  of non recurring financing expenses associated with a financing that was not consummated during january on march   our board of directors declared a special  one time cash dividend of per common share  payable april   to shareholders of record as of april  this dividend will aggregate approximately million and will be funded by the proceeds from our new financing arrangement 
this dividend payment was contingent upon our reincorporation in the state of delaware  which was approved by our shareholders and completed on march  on march   our shareholders approved the amendment and restatement of our stock award plan 
the amended and restated plan increased the number of shares available for grant from  to  and allows us to grant stock based awards other than stock options  such as stock appreciation rights  restricted stock  stock units  bonus stock  dividend equivalents  other stock related awards and performance awards that may be settled in cash  stock  or other property 
on january   we agreed to cancel certain outstanding stock options of anthony f 
bova  president and chief executive officer  which would have otherwise expired on that date 
in exchange for the cancellation of his  shares  mr 
bova will receive a cash payment of approximately million on the date of the special dividend payment 
the purpose of this option cancellation agreement is to provide mr 
bova with a payment similar to the dividend he would otherwise have received on the shares issuable upon the exercise of the options cancelled 
on march   we agreed to cancel the outstanding stock options of certain of our management  officers and directors the participants for cash payments of approximately million in aggregate in anticipation of the one time dividend payment 
the purpose of the option cancellation arrangements is to provide each participant with a payment similar to the dividend he or she would otherwise have received on the shares issuable upon the exercise of the options to be cancelled 
accordingly  on the date the special dividend is paid to our shareholders  we will cancel an aggregate of  outstanding stock options previously granted to the participants 

table of contents as a result of the option cancellations described above  we expect to record related compensation expense in the amount of  during fiscal in accordance with the provisions of fas r  which we adopted on january  we presently do not have any material commitments for future capital expenditures and expect to meet our short and long term liquidity needs with cash on hand  funds generated from operations  and funds available under our senior credit facility 
we believe our cash flows from operations  available cash and available borrowings under our new credit facility will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for at least the next few years 
see item  business factors that may affect future results 
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million in  compared with million in the difference between our net income in of million and our million operating cash flow was primarily attributable to approximately million of depreciation expense and a million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses offset by a million increase in accounts receivable  due to a higher level of sales  and a million increase in inventories primarily due to higher resin prices and a larger level of raw materials inventory 
cash flows from investing activities net cash used for investing activities in totaled million  compared with million in the cash used for investing activities in included million for the purchase of lavanture and million of capital expenditures related to capacity expansion within our building products and custom injection molding businesses 
the cash used for investing activities in of million consisted entirely of capital expenditures 
we expect that our capital expenditures will aggregate approximately million in fiscal this amount is comprised of approximately million to fund expansion  primarily for our custom films business and our injection molding business  and million for maintenance capital expenditures 
cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million in  compared with net cash used for financing activities of million in the cash provided by financing activities in reflects net borrowings of million under our credit facilities  proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million and repayments on notes receivable from shareholders of million

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations  including those resulting from the repayment of our credit facilities existing as of december  with the proceeds of our new debt facility entered into on march  as well as the repayment obligations under our new debt facility  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands maturity maturity maturity maturity less yr yrs yrs over yrs debt principal operating leases total commitments 
table of contents recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments  including stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure will no longer be an alternative 
sfas r permits companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas r for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date  and a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
this statement would be effective for public companies except small business issuers as defined in sec regulation s b for interim or annual periods beginning after june  a calendar year company therefore would be required to apply sfas r beginning july  and could choose to apply sfas r retroactively for the january  to june  year to date period in its third quarter form q to account for all share based payments under the fair value method from january  furthermore  companies can choose to early adopt the proposed statement at the beginning of its first quarter ended march  we adopted sfas r as of january  using the modified retrospective method 
the adoption resulted in the recognition of deferred compensation cost a component of equity of approximately  on january  amortization of such deferred compensation to expense will be  for the period prior to the cancellation of all outstanding options as discussed in liquidity and capital resources 
subsequent to the cancellation of all outstanding options  no further compensation expense will be recognized related to share based payments until any new share based payments are made 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued a revised version of interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb fin r 
the interpretation was effective for any vies created after january  and for vies in which an enterprise obtained an interest after that date 
we adopted the provisions of fin r as of march   however  as we did not hold any vies at such time  the adoption of this pronouncement did not have any effect on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks that may impact our financial condition and financial results due to changing interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
we do not participate in any significant hedging activities  nor do we currently utilize any significant derivative financial instruments 
the following discussion provides additional information regarding our market risks 
interest rate risk we have entered into variable rate debt that  at december   had an outstanding balance of million 
as of december   we had million of outstanding variable rate debt 
based on our variable rate obligations outstanding at december   and december   each basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would  respectively  increase or decrease our annual interest expense and related cash payments by approximately million and million  respectively 
on march   we replaced the credit facility in place on december  and entered into a new financing agreement resulting in total outstanding variable rate debt of million 
a basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would  respectively  increase or decrease our annual interest rate on this amount by approximately million 
such potential increases or decreases are based on certain simplifying assumptions  including a constant level of variable rate debt for all maturities and an immediate  across the board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period 
pursuant to our new credit agreements  during the second quarter of  we will enter into  and until maturity will maintain  interest rate protection for at least million of our outstanding debt 
foreign exchange rate risk we have a canadian dollar bank account and therefore are exposed to foreign exchange currency market risk 
we have determined this risk to be immaterial at both december  and december  based on the balance maintained in that account and the overall level of our canadian operations
