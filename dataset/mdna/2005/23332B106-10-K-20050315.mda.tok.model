item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis is intended to provide an investor with a narrative of our financial results and an evaluation of our financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview our business model is relatively straightforward 
dsp group is a fabless semiconductor company that is a leader in providing chipsets to telephone equipment manufacturers that incorporate our chipsets into consumer products for the residential wireless telecommunication market 
our chipsets incorporate advanced technologies  such as dsp processors  communications technologies  highly advanced radio frequency rf devices and in house developed voice over internet protocol voip hardware and software technologies 
our products include mhz  ghz digital enhanced cordless telecommunications dect  ghz and ghz chipsets for cordless telephones  bluetooth for voice  data and video communication  solutions for digital voice recorders dvrs and multimedia players  and voip and other voice over packet applications 
our current primary focus is cordless telephony as sales of our ghz and ghz chipsets represented approximately of our total revenues for  with the ghz chipsets gaining increased sales 
during recent years we have become a worldwide leader in developing and marketing total telephony solutions for a wide range of applications for wireless residential markets 
we believe we were able to penetrate the residential wireless telephony market and increase our market share and customer base by taking advantage of three trends in the market the move from wired to wireless products  the transformation from analog based to digital based technologies for telephony products  and the shift in bandwidth from mhz to ghz technologies  as well as the recent shift from ghz to ghz technologies 
our focus on the convergence of these three trends has allowed us to offer products with more features  and better range  security and voice quality 
one additional factor that contributed significantly to our revenue growth over the past few years is the market acceptance of our pioneer multi hand set solutions for cordless telephony 
to keep pace with market trends  including the convergence of video  voice and data  we are developing a portfolio of system on a chip  short range communications solutions eg edct  dect  bluetooth for portable multimedia eg speech  music  video and still image  voip and wi fi applications in consumer electronics and telecommunications products 
products that we developed in include a dect ghz chipset for the european market  a new chipset that includes video capabilities for the european and us markets and a new bluetooth chipset 
we further announced recently that we have developed an ip cordless phone that will enable connectivity to a broadband connection feeding voip services with cordless phone capabilities 
in addition  we are developing a new feature based on bluetooth technology that will enable connectivity of bluetooth enabled cellular phones to residential fixed line phones 
we recently reached a significant and strategic milestone for the company by introducing our first dect standard ghz chipsets for the european market and by delivering our first shipments of these chipsets to a key customer during the third and the fourth quarter of in our revenues grew by in comparison to the same period in  reaching a record level of million in sales 
our gross profit increased to a record level of in from in our operating profit decreased by in as compared to and reached a level of million  approximately of revenues compared to in the decrease in operating profit was mainly due to a increase in our operating expenses in as compared to this increase in operating expenses was mainly a result of our significant increase in research and development expenses  primary attributable to the hiring of new employees in operating expenses for also included a charge of million for impairment of goodwill and a write off of million for in process research and development related to the acquisition of the assets of bermai inc  as further discussed below 

table of contents during the second quarter of  we moved into the multimedia communications market by acquiring the assets of teleman inc  for a total consideration of million plus transaction expenses 
in addition  we hired engineers that were previously employed by teleman 
teleman  founded in  developed an advanced silicon platform for video compression and decompression designed to interface with image sensors and panel displays 
the teleman silicon platform supports compression standards such as mpeg  jpeg and h during the fourth quarter of  we acquired substantially all of the assets of bermai inc for a total consideration of million  plus transaction costs 
bermai developed an advanced wi fi technology based on the protocol that is optimized for quality of service for video streaming applications 
we plan to leverage this technology to further develop and offer new communications products 
we believe the current investment in wi fi technology may allow us in the future to develop products that will improve the quality of wireless video communication in the residence  and may increase our market share in ip phones that combine the wi fi communication channel in the same system that connects to a broadband connection feeding voip services 
to optimize the benefits of the bermai acquisition  we will need to increase our operating expenses  mainly in research and development in and future periods 
we were able to expand our portfolio of new technologies introduced in the residential communications market through our acquisition of the video and wi fi technologies of teleman and bermai 
we believe these strategic acquisitions enable us to integrate voice  data and video technologies with broadband offerings and prepare us for the dynamic and evolving nature of the short range multimedia communication and home wireless networking markets 
our second quarter results also included an expense item of million resulting from the impairment of goodwill associated with voicepump  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary that sells to the voip gateway market 
as a result of our decision to stop developing products targeted at this market and to focus our efforts on voip telephony products  we wrote down the value of goodwill associated with the voicepump acquisition to its estimated fair value of approximately million 
during  we repurchased an aggregate of  shares of our common stock for million at an average price of per share 
our total position in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities increased during by million to a total of million as of december  despite our historical growth  our business operates in a highly competitive environment  characterized by changing standards and rapid introduction of new products 
competition has historically increased pricing pressures for our products and decreased our average selling prices 
in order to penetrate new markets and maintain our market share with our traditional products we may need to offer our products in the future at lower prices than we currently anticipate which may result in lower profits 
in addition  as we are a fabless semiconductor company  global market trends such as over capacity problems in fabrication facilities may increase our raw material costs and thus decrease our gross margins 
we must continue to monitor and control costs  improve operating yields and maintain our current level of gross margin in order to offset future declines in average selling prices 
in addition  our future growth is also dependent on the continued market deployment and acceptance of our existing ghz and ghz digital products as well as our success in penetrating the ghz dect european market 
also  since our products are incorporated into end products of our oem customers  our business is very dependent on their ability to achieve market acceptance of their end products in consumer electronic markets  which are similarly very competitive 
as an example  the second half of was a challenging period for the consumer electronics industry  which encountered demand and inventory issues across different product lines 
these challenges adversely impacted our business for the second half of however  based on the latest forecasts we received from our customers and on our year end backlog  we believe the consumer electronics industry is slowly recovering 

table of contents there are also several emerging market trends that challenge our ability to continue to grow our business 
we believe that new developments in the home residential market may adversely affect our operating results 
for example  the rapid deployment of new communication access methods  including mobile  wireless broadband  cable and other connectivity  as well as the projected lack of growth in products using fixed line telephony would reduce our revenues derived from  and unit sales of  cordless telephony products  which is currently our primary focus 
our ability to maintain our growth will depend on the expansion of our product lines to capitalize on the emerging communication access methods and on our success in developing and selling a portfolio of system on a chip solutions that integrate video  voice  data and communication technologies in a wider multimedia market 
our business may also be affected by the outcome of the current competition between cell phone operators and fixed line operators for the provision of residential communication 
our revenues are currently primarily generated from sales of chipsets used in cordless phones that are based on fixed line telephony 
as a result  a decline in the use of fixed line telephony for residential communication would adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
in view of the current market trends  our currently planned future products are anticipated to enable connectivity of bluetooth enabled cellular phones to fixed line phones and also will include wi fi capabilities 
we are also preparing for the deployment of broadband services to the residence  a current trend in our market  by adding voip capabilities to our chipsets designated for cordless phones 
we currently plan to begin shipment of such products in however  we cannot provide any assurances about if and when these future features and products we develop will achieve market acceptance 
moreover  in order to increase our sales volume and expand our business  we recognize that we will need to penetrate new markets 
thus  we recently introduced our first dect standard ghz chipset for the european market 
in  we achieved our first two design wins for our new dect products targeted for the european market and in the second half of began to deliver shipments of dect products to a key customer 
in order to develop new products and penetrate such new markets  we will need to increase our operating expenses  mainly in research and development and applications engineering  for and future periods 
however  we cannot provide any assurances that we will successfully develop new products and services targeted at these new markets or that these products and services will achieve sufficient market acceptance to generate meaningful revenues for us 
we believe that our dect product lines will drive our growth in and  and products for home communication  including bluetooth and wi fi products  will contribute to our revenues in and beyond 
we believe that additional features such as voice enhancement  text to speech  polyphonic ringer  color display and other advanced features will also contribute to our growth in future years 
however  our ability to expand into new markets may not occur and may require us to substantially increase our operating expenses 
as a result  you should not rely upon our past operating results as an indication of future performance
