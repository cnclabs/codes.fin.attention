the following discussion provides information and analysis of our results of operations from fiscal through fiscal  and our liquidity and capital resources 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein 
restatement of financial statements on february   the office of the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission sec issued a letter to the american institute of certified public accountants expressing its views regarding certain operating lease accounting issues and their application under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the company s management subsequently initiated a review of its lease related accounting practices and determined that  like many other retailers  the period over which it recognized rent expense and amortized tenant allowances was not in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb technical bulletin  accounting for operating leases with scheduled rent increases  ftb no 
and technical bulletin no 
issues relating to accounting for leases ftb no 

as a result  the company s consolidated financial statements as of january  and for each of the two fiscal years in the period ended january  have been restated 
under the requirements of ftb no 
 rent expense should be recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease  including any rent holiday period 
in prior periods  the company determined that the term of the lease begins on the rent commencement date of the lease  which generally coincides with the store opening date  instead of at the time the company takes physical possession of the property to start construction of leasehold improvements 
this had the effect of excluding the construction period of the stores from the calculation of the period over which rent is expensed 
the company now considers possession to occur on the date it enters the space and begins construction build out 
with respect to lease incentives such as tenant allowances received from the landlord to cover construction costs incurred  ftb no 
states that lease incentives should be treated by the company as a reduction of rental expense and recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease in accordance with ftb no 
the company s policy related to lease incentives had been to record such incentives as deferred liabilities and amortize them as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease which generally coincides with the store opening date  instead of at the time the company takes physical possession of the property to start construction of leasehold improvements 
this had the effect of excluding the construction period of the stores from the calculation of the period over which lease incentives are amortized 
for all periods presented herein  the company determined that investments in auction rate securities should have been classified as marketable securities and not as cash and cash equivalents 
as a result  securities that have stated maturities beyond three months  but are priced and traded as short term investments due to the liquidity provided through the interest rate reset mechanism approximately every days  are now shown as marketable securities 
the purchase and sale of marketable securities previously presented as cash and cash equivalents have been reclassified to investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report for a summary of the effects of these changes on the company s consolidated balance sheet as of january   as well as on the company s consolidated statements of income  cash flows and stockholders equity for the fiscal years ended january  and february  see note  quarterly financial information unaudited for the effects of these changes on the company s quarterly periods for fiscal and the company intends to amend its forms q for the fiscal quarters ended may   july  and october  to reflect the restatement 
the information provided in the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reflects the effect of these restatements 
general the gymboree corporation is a specialty retailer operating stores selling high quality apparel and accessories for children and women under the gymboree  janie and jack  and janeville brands  as well as play programs for children under the gymboree play music brand 
as of january   the company conducted its business through four primary divisions gymboree  janie and jack  janeville and gymboree play music 
as of january   we had stores  including stores in the united states including janie and jack shops and janeville stores and stores in canada 
the company also operates two on line stores at www 
gymboree 
com and www 
janieandjack 
com 
several significant events occurred in or with respect to fiscal that affected the company s business  results of operations and the financial statements for that period  including the restatement of the company s financial statements to correct certain aspects of the company s accounting for operating leases  discussed above in restatement of financial statements  a charge for discontinued operations due to the shutdown of the company s united kingdom and ireland operations  discussed in the immediately following paragraph  the costs and timing of expenses related to the relocation of the company s headquarters to san francisco  california  discussed below in compared to lease termination charges  and liquidity and capital resources  the change in the method of accounting for inventory from the retail to the cost method  discussed below in critical accounting policies and estimates inventory valuation  and the favorable resolution of a canadian tax audit  discussed below under compared to income taxes 
on august   the board of directors authorized the company to proceed with the closure of its united kingdom and ireland operations stores and one distribution center  as a result of their continued poor financial performance 
as of october   all such operations had substantially ceased  and all of the stores were closed by november  the results of the united kingdom and ireland operations have been presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements for all periods presented 
the company s net sales for fiscal increased to from million in fiscal and million in fiscal our net income totaled million in compared to million in and million in comparable store net sales  based on a week period  increased during versus  during versus  and during versus we expect that future increases in net sales and net income will be dependent on  among other factors  our ability to reduce product costs in our core gymboree division and our ability to expand our two new growth concepts  janie and jack and janeville 
in  we plan to continue to grow our store base  opening approximately gymboree stores including approximately outlet stores  to janie and jack shops  and janeville stores 
we also expect to close approximately under performing gymboree stores throughout the year 
we are moving aggressively to improve gross margins and reduce product costs in our gymboree division while maintaining the stylish and high quality garments our customers expect from us 
we expect to begin to see benefits from this initiative in the second half of the year ended january  fiscal 
we believe that our long term growth will depend on the development and implementation of new retail concepts  such as janie and jack and janeville  as well as the continued investment in our core retail brand  gymboree 
as such  we expect to continue to devote time and effort in evaluating  developing  and testing new concepts when we perceive opportunities in the marketplace 
such efforts inevitably require significant management attention at all phases of the process and  for those concepts that we determine to launch  significant capital expenditures 
the company s year end is on the saturday closest to january fiscal  and  which included weeks each  ended on january   january  and february   respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we identified our most critical accounting policies and estimates to be those related to inventory valuation  asset impairment  workers compensation  sales return reserve  income taxes and lease termination charges 
inventory valuation 
we review our inventory levels in order to identify slow moving merchandise and broken assortments items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes and reduce prices to sell merchandise 
we estimate inventory shortage for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date 
our inventory shortage estimate can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shortage trends 
effective february   the company elected to change its accounting method for inventory valuation from the retail method to the lower of cost or market method  determined on a weighted average basis the cost method 
the company believes the cost method is a preferable method for matching the cost of merchandise with the revenues generated 
asset impairment 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the undiscounted future cash flows from the long lived assets are less than the carrying value  we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the assets 
decisions to close a store or facility can also result in accelerated depreciation over the revised useful life 
for locations to be closed which are under long term leases  we record a charge for lease buyout expense or the difference between our rent and the rate at which we expect to be able to sublease the properties and related cost  as appropriate 
most closures occur upon the lease expiration 
our estimate of future cash flows is based on our experience  knowledge and occasionally third party advice or market data 
however  these estimates can be affected by factors such as future store profitability  real estate demand and economic conditions that are difficult to predict 
workers compensation 
the company is partially self insured for workers compensation insurance 
the company records a liability for its deductible based on claims filed and an estimate of claims that may have been incurred but not reported 
if the actual amount of claims filed exceeds our estimates  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional accruals may be required in future periods 
sales return reserve 
the company records a reserve for estimated product returns based on historical return trends 
if actual returns are greater than those projected by management  additional sales returns may be recorded in the future 
income taxes 
the company provides for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes sfas 
sfas requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company maintains valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  the company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
the company is also subject to examination of income tax returns for open years by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
the company periodically assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations  to determine the impact on deferred taxes and income tax liabilities and the adequacy of the provision for income taxes 
lease termination liabilities discontinued operations 
lease termination liabilities represent costs to terminate lease contracts before the end of their term 
a liability is recognized and measured at its fair value when the company ceases using the leased property 
if actual lease termination costs exceed our estimates  additional charges may be required in future periods 
lease termination charge corporate headquarters 
in november  the company estimated the lease termination charge related to its former corporate headquarters in burlingame  california  based upon the difference between the terms of the original lease agreement which had been assumed by the company s landlord of its new corporate headquarters in san francisco  california and the estimated fair market value of a lease for similar property 
compared to net sales net retail sales for the fifty two weeks ended january  increased to million from million in the fifty two weeks ended january   an increase of million  or 
comparable store sales for the week period increased or million over the same week period last year 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in the average transaction value driven by higher average retail sales on a per unit basis as customers responded favorably to the upgraded fashion  embellishments  and fabrication of our garments 
in addition  the number of transactions on a comparable store basis increased due to higher customer traffic 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the number of units sold per transaction 
non comparable store sales increased million primarily due to net store and square footage growth of stores and  square feet  respectively 
the number of retail stores open at the end of the period was  compared to open at the end of fiscal the increase in net retail sales includes a million increase in shipping income resulting from the increase in our on line store businesses  a decrease of million in sales to off price retailers as a result of our seasonal clearance strategy whereby markdown merchandise is primarily sold at our retail stores  and an increase of million in sales returns and gymbucks promotional discounts 
play music net sales for the fifty two weeks ended january  decreased to million from million in the fifty two weeks ended january   a decrease of million or 
the decrease was primarily due to the closure of company owned sites as part of the restructuring of our play music business

as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to from in the same period last year 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the incremental investment in our buying infrastructure required to operate multiple concepts  as well as our additional investment in the quality  novelty  and fashion embellishments in our garments 
we expect gross profit as a percentage of net sales to decrease moderately in fiscal  as our initiative to improve product cost will not impact financial results until the latter half of the year 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a  which principally consist of non occupancy store expenses  corporate overhead and distribution expenses  increased for the fifty two weeks ended january  to million from million in the fifty two weeks ended january  as a percentage of net sales  sg a increased to in compared to in fiscal the increase in sg a as a percentage of net sales resulted primarily from an increase in costs related to benefits  corporate marketing and marketing infrastructure 
in addition  sg a was impacted by increased costs at our distribution facility related to the increase in our on line businesses and increased unit shipments resulting from store growth 
we expect sg a as a percentage of net sales to be flat to slightly lower in fiscal  as we are moving aggressively to reduce our expenses 
lease termination charges in connection with our move to our new corporate headquarters  our current landlord assumed our obligations under the lease for our previous corporate offices in burlingame  california 
as a result  lease termination charges of million consist of non cash charges related to the company s headquarters relocation in the fourth quarter of fiscal approximately million of this amount was recorded as a deferred lease incentive from the company s new landlord  which will be amortized over the life of the new corporate office lease as a reduction of rent expense 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
foreign exchange gains losses  net net foreign exchange losses totaled  for the fifty two weeks ended january  compared to net gains of  for the same period last year 
these gains and losses resulted from currency fluctuations on inter company transactions between our united states operations and foreign subsidiaries 
the amount of foreign exchange gains or losses is dependent on both monthly currency fluctuations and inter company balances 
interest income interest income increased to million for the fifty two weeks ended january  from million in the same period last year due to interest earned on higher cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances during fiscal interest expense interest expense remained at million for the fifty two weeks ended january   and includes unused line of credit fees and the amortization of prepaid loan fees 
income tax during fiscal  our effective tax rate for continuing operations was reduced from to a benefit of approximately due primarily to the reversal of tax reserves  which was largely attributable to the favorable resolution of a canadian income tax audit and other matters 
without the effect of the reversal  our effective tax rate for fiscal would have been

comparable store sales for the week period increased or million over the same week period last year 
the increase in comparable store sales was due to additional product variety offered by gymboree  including more frequent delivery of new product lines  expanded size options  and a new baby basics line 
the increase was also due to janie and jack shops offering more fashion items to accommodate customers requests 
these increases were offset by a decrease in comparable store sales from our gymboree boy business  as our strategy of emphasizing a larger basics product assortment while combining the styling of our baby and kid boy departments  was not successful 
in the fourth quarter of  we returned to offering distinct styling between our baby and kid boy departments and began to rebalance the mix of fashion and basics in our product assortment 
non comparable store sales increased million primarily due to net store and square footage growth of stores and  square feet  respectively 
the number of retail stores open at the end of the period was  compared to open at the end of fiscal the increase in net retail sales includes a million increase in shipping income resulting from the increase in our on line store business  a million increase in sales to off price retailers  and an increase of million in sales returns and gymbucks promotional discounts 
play music net sales for the fifty two weeks ended january  decreased to million from million in the fifty two weeks ended february   a decrease of million or 
the decrease was primarily due to the closure of company owned sites  lower royalty payments and product sales by existing franchisees  as well as a decrease in new franchises and related equipment sales

the base rate margin was and the eurodollar rate margin was as of january  this credit facility requires the company to meet financial covenants on a quarterly basis and limits annual capital expenditures 
during the quarter ended january   the company did not meet one of its financial covenants due to additional rent expense recognized as a result of the lease accounting adjustment discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

as part of the lease  the company s new landlord assumed the company s lease obligations for its burlingame  california headquarters through the expiration of such lease 
on november   the company moved into its new corporate headquarters in san francisco and ceased use of the burlingame headquarters 
as a result  the company recorded a non cash lease termination charge  before income tax  of million in the fourth quart er of fiscal at the same time  the same amount was recorded as a deferred lease incentive on the company s consolidated balance sheet  which will be amortized over the life of the lease as a reduction of rent expense

the company s current plans for janie and jack and janeville will require increasing capital expenditures for store expansions for the next several years
