item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary our operating results for marked another year of growth with total revenues reaching billion and higher ending cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of billion  driven in large part by operating cash flows of million for the year 
although several factors contributed to our improved financial performance over  two important drivers were the continued growth experienced by our hiv products portfolio which is comprised of viread  emtriva and truvada  as well as the maintenance of ambisome revenues amidst increasing competition 
given increased international sales and a favorable foreign currency environment in europe  viread sales increased year over year and comprised of total product sales 
in august  we launched truvada  which is the co formulation of viread and emtriva  in the united states 
we began launching truvada in the european union following regulatory approval in february over time  depending on the treatment regimens prescribed by physicians  we expect to see truvada sales partially replace product sales of viread and emtriva 
to further increase our future sales of hiv products  we entered into a joint venture collaboration agreement with bms in december to develop and commercialize the fixed dose combination of gilead s truvada and bms sustiva in the united states 
understanding the importance of having a clear view of our wholesalers channel inventory  we signed inventory management agreements with our three major us wholesalers in in keeping with our strategy of active product acquisition and in licensing  we rounded out by entering into collaboration agreements in the area of hcv 
our operating results for were impacted by the acquisition of all of the assets of triangle in january we completed this acquisition to expand our antiviral pipeline 
triangle was a development stage company with a particular focus on potential therapies for hiv  including aids  and hbv 
the aggregate purchase price was million and included cash paid of million  the fair value of stock options assumed of million  direct transaction costs of million and employee related costs of million 
approximately million of the consideration paid was allocated to purchased in process research and development and represented the fair value of triangle s incomplete research and development programs that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date 
as a result of this transaction and the related purchased in process research and development charge  our operating loss for was million 
this acquisition was important to us not only for the compounds we acquired  but also for the opportunity it provided us to create truvada  our co formulation of viread and emtriva  into a single pill that can be dosed once a day 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the triangle acquisition 
on september   gilead completed a two for one stock split  effected in the form of a stock dividend  to stockholders of record as of august  accordingly  all share and per share amounts for all periods presented have been restated to reflect this stock split 
in addition  certain prior year amounts have also been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
forward looking statements and risk factors the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the risk factors discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  clinical trial accruals and our tax provision 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results  however  may differ significantly from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence an arrangement exists  delivery to the customer has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for expected returns of expired products  distributor fees  government rebate programs  such as medicaid reimbursements and customer incentives  such as cash discounts for prompt payment 
estimates for distributor fees are based on contractually determined fixed percentages of sales 
estimates for government rebate programs and cash discounts are based on contractual terms  historical utilization rates and expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs 
estimates for product returns  including new products  are based on an on going analysis of industry and historical return patterns 
this includes monitoring the feedback that we receive from our sales force regarding customer use and satisfaction  reviewing inventory data available to us through our us wholesaler inventory management agreements to assist us in monitoring channel inventory levels  the purchase of third party data to monitor prescriptions as well as  for new products  a review of our other long shelf life products we have sold through the same or similar channels 
further  we monitor the activities and clinical trials of our key competitors and assess the potential impact on our future sales and return expectations where necessary 
expected returns for our marketed drugs are generally low because the shelf life for these products ranges from months for truvada and up to months for ambisome and viread in the united states 
if conditions become more competitive for any of the markets served by our drugs or if other circumstances change  we may take actions to increase our product return estimates or we may offer additional customer incentives 
this would result in an incremental reduction of future revenue at the time the return estimate is changed or new incentives are offered 
contract revenue for research and development is recorded as performance occurs and the earnings process is completed based on the performance requirements of the contract 
nonrefundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist  and where there is no continuing involvement by gilead  are recognized on the earlier of when the payments are received or when collection is reasonably assured 
revenue from non refundable up front license fees and milestone payments where we continue to have involvement such as through a development collaboration or an obligation to supply product is recognized as performance occurs and our obligations are completed 
in accordance with the specific terms of gilead s obligations under these types of arrangements  revenue is recognized as the manufacturing obligation is fulfilled or ratably over the development period 
revenue associated with substantive at risk milestones is recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones as defined in the respective agreements 
advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance is based on our analysis of several factors including  but not limited to  contractual payment terms  historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances  an analysis of days sales outstanding by customer and geographic region  and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practices 
if the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
our allowance for doubtful accounts balance as a percentage of total accounts receivable did not materially change from december  to december  we believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions  however  significant deterioration in any of the above factors  especially with respect to the government funding and reimbursement practices in the european market could materially change these expectations and result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories we write down our inventory based on historical review of the quantity of bad batches experienced during the manufacturing process and expectations of production and inventory levels 
we also perform quality control reviews of our individual raw material batches 
we generally do not record inventory write offs based on estimated obsolescence or risk of competition primarily because the shelf life of our products is long 
however  if our current assumptions about future production or inventory levels  demand or competition were to change or if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  inventory write downs may be required which could negatively impact our product gross margins and results of operations 
clinical trial accruals we record accruals for estimated clinical and preclinical study costs 
most of our clinical and preclinical studies are performed by third party contract research organizations cros 
these costs are a significant component of research and development expenses 
during  and  we incurred million  million and million  respectively  of cro costs 
we accrue costs for clinical studies performed by cros on a straight line basis over the term of the service period and adjust our estimates  if required  based upon our on going review of the level of effort actually incurred by the cro 
initially we estimate that the work performed under the contracts occurs ratably over the periods to the expected milestone  event or total contract completion date 
the expected completion dates are estimated based upon the terms of the contracts and past experience with similar contracts 
these estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and other measures of activities specified in the contract 
as a result  we validate our accruals quarterly through written vendor confirmations and detailed reviews of the activities performed for our significant contracts 
based upon the results of these validation processes  we assess the appropriateness of our accruals and make any adjustments we deem necessary to ensure that our expenses reflect the actual effort incurred by the cros 
generally  a significant portion of the total costs are associated with start up activities for the trial and patient enrollment 
gilead extensively outsources its clinical trial activities and usually performs only a small portion of the start up activities in house 
as a result  cros typically perform most of the total start up activities for our trials  including document preparation  site identification  screening and preparation  pre study visits  training and program management 
on a budgeted basis  these costs are typically to of the total contract value 
on an actual basis  this percentage range is significantly wider as many of our contracts are either expanded or reduced in scope compared to the original budget while the start up costs for the particular trial do not change significantly 
start up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been established and are milestone or event driven in nature 
the remaining activities and related costs  such as patient monitoring and administration  generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study 
most contracts are negotiated as fixed unit prices and can vary in length between six months for a single dose phase study and up to two years or more for a more complex phase study 
the average length of contract in  and has been at the upper end of this range in order to provide long term safety and efficacy data to support the commercial launches of viread  truvada  hepsera and emtriva 
through december   differences between actual and estimated activity levels for any particular study were not significant enough to require a material adjustment 
all of our material cro contracts are terminable by us upon written notice and gilead is generally only liable for actual effort expended by the cro at any point in time during the contract  regardless of payment status 
amounts paid in advance of services being performed will be refunded if a contract is terminated 
however  if management does not receive complete and accurate information from our vendors or has underestimated activity levels associated with a study at a given point in time  we would have to record additional and potentially significant research and development expenses in future periods 
tax provision we develop our income tax provision including deferred tax assets and liabilities  based on significant management judgment 
we evaluate the realizibility of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are likely to be realized 
we consider future taxable income  ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance  we would reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made 
such an adjustment was made in the fourth quarter of and when we determined that it was more likely than not that certain of our deferred tax assets would be realized  and therefore  we released the related valuation allowance 
this resulted in an income tax benefit for and of approximately million and million  respectively 
similarly  if we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets for which we have no valuation allowance  we would increase the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made 
our future effective income tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws or rates  changes in the interpretation of these laws  the impact of accounting for employee stock options beginning in the second half of  and overall changes in future levels of earnings and research and development and capital spending 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of gilead s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented above relating to them 
results of operations total revenues we had total revenue of billion in  million in and million in included in total revenue are product sales  royalty revenue and contract revenue includes revenue earned from research and development r d and manufacturing collaborations 
product sales product sales consisted of the following in thousands change change viread emtriva truvada total hiv products ambisome other total product sales product sales increased in compared to and in compared to  due primarily to the increase in the volume of sales within our hiv products 
a significant percentage of our product sales continue to be denominated in foreign currencies 
we use forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales  primarily those denominated in the euro 
this reduces  but does not eliminate  fluctuations in sales due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
losses on these revenue hedges reduced increases in product sales by million in  million in and million in  due to fluctuations in exchange rates 
however  product sales mainly viread and ambisome benefitted overall  primarily from the increases in the exchange rates for the euro and the british pound in comparison with the us dollar million when comparing to and million when comparing to prior to  we experienced significant fluctuations in us distribution channel inventory levels due to speculative purchasing by the major wholesalers 
as a result  we experienced increased quarter over quarter sales volatility from these purchasing patterns 
in order to help alleviate these fluctuations  in july  we entered into inventory management agreements imas with amerisourcebergen drug corporation  cardinal health  inc and mckesson corporation  three major pharmaceutical wholesalers that distribute more than percent of the portfolio of products that we sell in the united states 
these agreements were implemented to limit speculative buying and to help ensure that wholesaler purchasing is more consistent with customer demand and more predictable 
under these agreements  we agreed to pay the wholesalers a fee in exchange for product distribution and inventory management services  market research information  return goods processing assistance and counterfeit product detection services 
such fees are recorded as a reduction to product sales in the consolidated statements of operations 
additionally  under the terms of the agreements  each wholesaler has agreed not to exceed specified maximum levels of inventory on hand 
as of the end of december  we believe that these three major wholesalers have inventories on hand for all gilead products of less than one month s supply  which is in compliance with the contractually specified levels 
viread  emtriva and truvada were approved for sale in the united states in october  july and august  respectively 
viread and emtriva were approved for sale in the european union in february and october  respectively 
sales of viread were  and of total product sales in  and  respectively 
of the viread sales in  million were us sales  an increase of versus  and million were international sales  an increase of versus of the viread sales in  million were us sales  an increase of versus  and million were international sales  an increase of versus since emtriva s introduction in july  sales increased significantly from million in to million in also  since august when truvada was approved for sale in the united states  product sales have totaled million through december  total hiv product sales in were million higher compared to due to the favorable european currency environment  the majority of which relates to viread sales 
we believe that as our product sales mix changes with patients who are currently taking viread and or emtriva switching to truvada  looking at our hiv products sales collectively is a more relevant basis for period over period comparison 
sales of hiv products as a percentage of total product sales were  and for  and  respectively 
in  we expect sales from our hiv products to be billion to billion for the full year 
sales of ambisome were  and of total product sales in  and  respectively 
as our hiv and hbv product sales continue to increase  ambisome sales are decreasing as a percentage of total product sales 
of the ambisome sales in  million were us sales  a decrease of versus  and million were international sales  an increase of versus of the ambisome sales in  million were us sales  a decrease of versus  and million were international sales  an increase of over reported ambisome sales for were million higher due to the favorable currency environment compared to on a volume basis  ambisome sales in the united states decreased from while sales volume in europe increased slightly by compared to when analyzing the decrease in us sales  it is important to note that while us product sales decreased when comparing to  volume decreased only 
our discussion of us ambisome sales relates solely to our sales of ambisome to fujisawa which is recorded at our manufacturing cost 
in  due to greater manufacturing efficiencies  our per unit manufacturing cost for ambisome decreased  thereby decreasing revenues reported for our sales to fujisawa 
royalties that we earn on sales of ambisome by fujisawa are discussed below 
with continuing competition  we expect ambisome sales for to be in the range of million to million 
royalty revenue we recorded royalty revenues of million in  compared with million in and million in during this three year period  our most significant source of royalty revenue resulted from sales of tamiflu by roche and sales of ambisome in the united states by fujisawa under a co promotion arrangement with us 
royalty revenues earned on sales of tamiflu were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
royalty revenues earned on sales of ambisome by fujisawa were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
as it is difficult to estimate third party product sales  we record royalty revenue from roche one quarter in arrears 
due to a severe influenza epidemic in the united states in late through early  our royalty revenues increased substantially during the first and second quarters of increased awareness and discussion about the supply of influenza treatments in has further increased roche s sales of tamiflu and consequently  our royalties for the third and fourth quarters of contract revenue total contract revenue was million in  compared with million in and million in in  contract revenue consisted primarily of million in research and milestone revenue earned from eyetech pharmaceuticals which included million net milestone payments earned upon the filing of new drug applications by eyetech in europe and the united states for macugen pegaptanib sodium injection 
in  the primary source of contract revenue consisted of million in license fees earned in conjunction with our licensing agreement with eyetech for macugen 
in  contract revenue primarily consisted of million due to our licensing of the selex process patent estate to archemix  which  due to collectibility concerns  we recognized on a cash basis  and million in milestone payments from roche for the european prophylaxis and treatment approvals of tamiflu 
in december  we completed the sale of our oncology assets to osi 
under the terms our agreement  we are entitled to additional payments from osi of up to million in either cash or a combination of cash and osi stock if and when osi reaches certain development milestones for nx  the most advanced of the oncology product candidates sold to osi 
under a related manufacturing agreement  we produce nx and gs l  the two liposomal products included in the sales at our manufacturing facility in san dimas  california 
in  and  we recognized million  million and million  respectively  of contract revenue under this manufacturing agreement 
cost of goods sold and product gross margins the following table indicates cost of goods sold and product gross margins in thousands change change total product sales cost of goods sold gross margin percentage our gross margin was relatively flat from to as the positive impact of improvements in certain manufacturing processes and a favorable foreign currency environment was offset by changes in product sales mix 
comparing to  gross margin improved primarily due to a change in product mix as viread  a higher margin product  contributed more significantly to net product sales in changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact gross margins since we price our products in the currency of the country into which the products are sold while a significant majority of our manufacturing costs are in us dollars 
for example  an increase in the value of these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar will positively impact gross margins since our manufacturing costs will remain approximately the same while our revenues after being translated into us dollars  will increase 
although the weakening us dollar has positively impacted gross revenues and gross margins in  and  the full effect of the foreign currency exchange rates has been moderated by our hedging program on forecasted international sales 
except for the potential impact of unpredictable and uncontrollable changes in exchange rates relative to the us dollar and the mix of product sales between our various hiv products  hepsera and ambisome  we expect gross margins in to be consistent with those of  within the range of 
research and development expenses the following table summarizes our research and development expenses into these major components in thousands change change research clinical development pharmaceutical development total the three major categories of research and development r d expenses consist of personnel costs  including salaries and benefits  clinical studies performed by contract research organizations  materials and supplies  and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities related costs 
research costs typically consist of preclinical and toxicology work 
clinical development costs include phase   and clinical trials as well as expanded access programs 
pharmaceutical development costs consist of product formulation and chemical analysis 
prior to  clinical development consisted only of clinical trial expenses for phases through and phase in the united states 
phase european clinical trials were included in sales  general and administrative sg a 
during  in order to better reflect the nature of the european phase clinical trials  we began recording these clinical trial expenses as research and development 
in order to be consistent with the current year presentation  million and million of expenses were reclassified from selling  general and administrative to research and development expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million increase in r d expenses in over was primarily attributable to increased salaries of million due largely to higher headcount  increased contract research organization costs of million associated with increased clinical activities  as well as million research and license fees paid by us in relation to hepatitis c collaboration agreements effective in the fourth quarter of the new collaborations were entered into with achillion and genelabs and required us to pay aggregate license fees of million which were expensed as r d as the underlying technology had no alternative future use 
the increase in r d activity was partially offset by a decrease in spending due to the discontinuation of our two programs  gs and gs  that focused on the development of certain hiv investigational products 
it is also important to note that our r d expenses included a reimbursement to gilead of million from the settlement of a contractual dispute with a vendor 
the million increase in r d spending in versus was primarily attributable to increased salaries of million due largely to higher headcount  increased clinical supplies costs of million and increased clinical trials costs associated with the development of emtriva and truvada  the co formulation of viread and emtriva 
also as mentioned above  in  we settled a contractual dispute with a vendor that resulted in reimbursement to us of million that was recorded to research and development expense 
in  we expect r d expenses to be approximately million to million 
this estimated increase in expenses over levels reflects increased spending on our internal research and development efforts as well as costs associated with post marketing studies to support our products  but excludes any expenses we may incur associated with potential collaborations or strategic acquisitions  including license and milestone fees or cost sharing arrangements  and the impact of accounting for employee stock based compensation beginning in the second half of industry reports indicate that a biopharmaceutical company generally takes to years an average of years to research  develop and bring to market a new prescription medicine in the united states 
these averages are generally consistent with the projects that we undertake internally  although our recent product development timelines have been on a slightly more accelerated basis 
drug development in the united states is a process that includes several steps defined by the fda 
the process begins with the filing of an ind  which  if successful  allows opportunity for clinical study of the potential new medicine 
clinical development typically involves three phases of study phase  and  and generally accounts for an average of seven years of a drug s total development time 
the most significant costs associated with clinical development are the phase trials as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
we currently have products in development that are in phase studies 
the successful development of our products is highly uncertain 
completion dates and r d expenses can vary significantly for each product and are difficult to predict 
even after successful development and fda approval of a product  we undertake additional studies to try to expand the product s label and market potential 
for a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing the development of products  see the risk factors that affect gilead section of item i above 
selling  general and administrative expenses the following table highlights the year to year changes in selling  general and administrative expenses in thousands change change selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   which includes the reclassification of phase iv clinical trial expenses incurred in to r d of million 
the significant increase in expenses in compared to is primarily due to increased salaries of million due largely to higher headcount  increased consulting fees of million related to sarbanes oxley compliance and business strategy consulting  as well as increased costs of million relating to speaker s programs  grants and journal advertising 
the remainder of the increase in sg a expenses in compared to is due to our increased global marketing efforts and increased infrastructure required to support the growth of our business 
during  as part of our infrastructure investments  we implemented a reorganization of our sales and marketing functions into a newly created commercial division 
in conjunction with this reorganization  we created and filled the new position of executive vice president  commercial operations who will have responsibility over global commercial operations and strategy for our product portfolio 
the increase in expenses in compared to  which includes the reclassification of phase iv clinical trial expenses to r d of million  is primarily due to increased salaries of million due largely to higher headcount  an increase in hedging costs of million  increased costs of million relating to marketing meetings and grants  as well as increased general and directors and officers insurance of million 
the remainder of the increase in sg a expenses is due to our global sales and marketing efforts including the expansion of our us and european sales forces and increased infrastructure required to support the growth of our business 
in  we expect sg a expenses to be approximately million to million primarily due to the anticipated launch costs for truvada in the european union  as well as ongoing investment in our global commercial organization through hiring and promotional programs  but excludes any expenses we may incur associated with potential collaborations or strategic acquisitions and the impact of applying the new standard on the accounting for employee stock based compensation beginning in the second half of purchased in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of the net assets of triangle completed in january  we recorded purchased in process research and development expenses of million in the first quarter of the charge was due to triangle s incomplete research and development programs that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date 
the value of the purchased in process research and development was determined by estimating the related future net cash flows between and using a present value risk adjusted discount rate of 
this discount rate is a significant assumption and is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital adjusted upward for the risks associated with the projects acquired 
the projected cash flows from the acquired projects were based on estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the projects considering the stage of development of each potential product acquired  the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of each product  the life of each potential commercialized product and associated risks including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a drug compound including obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals  and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets 
a summary of these programs at the acquisition date  and updated for subsequent developments through february  is as follows program description status of development estimated acquisition date fair value in millions emtricitabine for hiv a nucleoside analogue that has been shown to be an inhibitor of hiv replication in patients 
four phase studies were completed prior to the acquisition date 
us marketing approval was received from the fda in july for emtriva and european union approval received from the european commission in october emtricitabine tenofovir df fixed dose combination for hiv therapy a fixed dose co formulation of tenofovir and emtricitabine 
as of the acquisition date  work had not commenced on the potential co formulation except to the extent that work on emtricitabine as a single agent was progressing 
in march  applications for marketing approval were submitted in the united states and european union and in august marketing approval in the united states was received from the fda for truvada  the fixed dose co formulation of tenofovir and emtricitabine 
marketing approval in the european union was received in february amdoxovir for hiv a purine dioxolane nucleoside that may offer advantages over other marketed nucleosides because of its activity against drug resistant viruses as exhibited in patients with hiv infection 
this program was in phase trials at acquisition date 
in  we terminated the licensing agreement with emory university and the university of georgia research foundation  inc and development was discontinued 
clevudine for hbv a pyrimidine nucleoside analogue that has been shown to be an inhibitor of hbv replication in patients chronically infected with hbv 
this program was in phase trials at acquisition date 
in august  the licensing agreement with bukwang pharm 
ind 
co  ltd was terminated and development was discontinued 
emtricitabine for hbv an inhibitor of hbv replication in patients chronically infected with hbv 
one phase trial has been completed as of december  asset impairment during  we recorded an asset impairment charge of million on certain of our long lived assets  primarily leasehold improvements  manufacturing and laboratory equipment 
this non cash charge was driven by the decision in december to terminate our liposomal research and development activities in san dimas and discontinue the daunoxome product line 
the impairment was based on our analysis of the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the affected assets as compared to their carrying value 
as the carrying value exceeded the related estimated undiscounted cash flows  we wrote the carrying value of the long lived assets down to their estimated fair value 
in  subsequent to our decision to discontinue the daunoxome product line  we received unanticipated requests in europe asking gilead to reconsider selling daunoxome 
as a result of these requests  management decided to continue selling this product in certain countries and we are still evaluating our supply and sales strategy with respect to daunoxome 
in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  the new cost basis for the impaired assets was not adjusted for these new facts and circumstances 
gain loss on marketable securities pursuant to our agreement with eyetech entered into in march  we received a warrant to purchase  shares of eyetech series b convertible preferred stock  exercisable at a price of per share 
in january  eyetech completed an initial public offering of its common stock at which time we adjusted the fair value of the warrant resulting in a gain of million 
at that time  the fair value of the warrant was estimated using the black scholes valuation model with a volatility rate of and a discount rate of 
at the end of the first quarter of  we exercised the warrant on a net basis using shares of eyetech common stock as consideration for the exercise price and subsequently held  shares of eyetech common stock 
in the second quarter of  we sold all of the eyetech shares we owned and realized a gain of approximately million  which is included in interest and other income  net  for the year ended december  in july  we sold all of our remaining shares of osi common stock for approximately million 
these shares were partial consideration for the sale of our oncology assets to osi in december  at which time they were recorded at a fair market value of approximately million 
in connection with the sale of these remaining shares  we recognized a non operating loss of approximately million in the year ended december  make whole payment on debt redemption in october  gilead called for the redemption of all its outstanding convertible senior notes due december  on november  the convertible senior notes were called under a provisional redemption based upon the market price of gilead common stock exceeding certain thresholds 
the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the notes was million 
the convertible senior notes were redeemable at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes  plus a cash payment equal to accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date and a cash make whole payment equal to per  principal value of the notes less interest actually paid or accrued and unpaid from the date of issuance of the notes to the redemption date 
interest on the convertible senior notes ceased to accrue on the redemption date  and the only remaining right of the holders thereafter was to receive the redemption payment  including accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date and the make whole payment 
alternatively  note holders could elect to convert their notes into shares of gilead common stock at a price of per share  or shares of gilead common stock per  principal amount of the notes 
holders of substantially all of the outstanding notes converted their notes into shares of gilead s common stock prior to the november  redemption date 
as a result of these conversions   shares of common stock were issued to these note holders 
in connection with the redemption  gilead paid aggregate make whole payments of million to note holders 
interest and other income  net we recorded interest and other income of million in  compared with million in and million in the increase in compared to is primarily attributable to the higher cash balances and yields over the past year 
the decrease in compared to is attributable to the significant decline in interest rates and a lower average cash balance due to the acquisition of the net assets of triangle and the purchase of our foster city campus  partially offset by positive cash flow from operations 
interest income in will depend principally upon prevailing interest rates and the level of our cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances 
interest expense we incurred interest expense of million in  compared with million in and million in the decrease in over is primarily due to the conversion of our million convertible subordinated debt into shares of our common stock in december the only outstanding debt during most of consisted of our million convertible senior debt issued in december in november  we converted our convertible senior notes 
the significant increase in over is due to the full year of interest on our million convertible senior notes which were issued in december interest expense for and consisted primarily of interest on the million convertible subordinated notes  which were converted into shares of our common stock in december we expect interest expense in to decrease as compared with primarily due to the conversion of the million convertible senior notes in november provision for benefit from income taxes our provision for benefit from income taxes was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the effective income tax rate of differs from the us federal statutory rate of generally due to state taxes being more than offset by the recognition of previously unbenefitted net operating losses  tax credit carryforwards and certain earnings being taxed in foreign tax rate jurisdictions with lower tax rates for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be permanently reinvested outside the united states 
the tax benefit in includes the reversal of our valuation allowance against certain of our deferred tax assets 
in december of  we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would realize a portion of the benefit related to our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we reduced the valuation allowance against the assets and recorded a tax benefit of million 
the recognition of these deferred tax assets had no impact on our cash flows 
partially offsetting this tax benefit was income tax expense associated with income earned by our foreign subsidiaries  foreign losses benefitted at lower tax rates and the non tax deductibility of purchased in process research and development 
we had significant net operating loss carryforwards which were used to reduce our us tax liability 
excluding the benefit relating to the reversal of our valuation allowance  and the write off of purchased in process research and development  our effective tax rate for was 
the income tax expense in was primarily associated with income earned by our foreign subsidiaries as we had significant net operating losses in the united states 
the provision for was reduced by a change in the us income tax law 
this law allowed net operating loss carryforward deductions to offset of alternative minimum taxable income  resulting in a reduction of us income tax recorded in previous years of million 
on october   the american jobs creation act the ajca was signed into law 
the ajca allows for a deduction of of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated  as defined in the ajca 
we may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in fiscal we have started an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision  however  we do not expect to be able to complete this evaluation until after congress or the treasury department provide additional clarifying language on key elements of the provision 
we expect to complete our evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision within a reasonable period of time following the publication of the additional clarifying language 
the range of possible amounts that we are considering for repatriation under this provision is between zero and million maximum amount allowable to us as defined in the ajca 
currently  the related potential range of impact on income taxes cannot be reasonably estimated 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled billion at december   up from million at december  in  the increase of million was primarily due to net cash provided by operations of million and proceeds from issuances of stock under employee stock plans of million  partially offset by capital expenditures of million 
in  the cash decrease of million from was primarily due to the acquisition of triangle  for which the net cash impact was million  the purchase of our foster city campus for million and capital expenditures of million  partially offset by proceeds from issuance of stock under employee stock plans of million 
working capital at december  was billion compared to billion at december  significant changes in working capital during included a million decrease in current deferred tax assets more than offset by a million increase in accounts receivable and a million increase in inventory 
the million decrease in current deferred tax assets was primarily due to the utilization of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards to offset taxable income 
the accounts receivable increase of million was primarily due to increased sales of viread in the united states and europe and sales from our new product  truvada  launched in the united states in the latter half of the million increase in inventory was primarily due to an increase in the purchase of raw materials and the production of viread and truvada inventory to meet increasing sales demand 
current liabilities in increased by million from primarily due to the following a million increase in medicaid rebate obligations associated with higher sales of viread  a million increase in deferred revenue primarily due to royalties received from roche  a million increase in the liability associated with the fair value of our forward currency contracts as the us dollar continued to weaken against european currencies  an million increase in accounts payable primarily due to increases in our raw material purchases in support of viread and truvada sales growth  a million increase for increased compensation costs and employee benefits with added headcount  and an increase of million for distributors fees owed but not yet paid under the inventory management agreements entered into in july the increase in current liabilities was partially offset by a million decrease in accrued clinical and preclinical expenses as a result of decreasing activity associated with the clinical trial programs for viread and hepsera towards the end of in  we made capital expenditures of million compared to million in and million in these expenditures were primarily for domestic and international facilities improvements  including approximately million associated with the completion of our pilot plant in foster city which will be used to develop our drug processes and prepare materials to supply clinical trials  as well as additional spending for laboratory and manufacturing equipment to accommodate our growth 
capital expenditures related to research and development were between and of the million spent in  and of the million spent in and to of the million spent in we expect our capital spending for to be million to million due to increased infrastructure needs and higher r d spending 
we believe that our existing capital resources  supplemented by cash generated from our operations  will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the commercial performance of our current and future products  the progress and scope of our research and development efforts  including preclinical studies  and clinical trials  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities  administrative expenses  the possibility of acquiring manufacturing capabilities or additional office facilities  the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products  the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies  and defense costs associated with  settlements of and adverse results of litigation 
we may in the future require additional funding  which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings  such as from our universal shelf registration statement filed in december for the potential issuance of up to million of our securities  or additional collaborative agreements with corporate entities 
if such funding is required  we cannot assure that it will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
subsidiaries and other we have established a variety of subsidiaries in various countries for the purpose of conducting business in those locations 
all of these subsidiaries are consolidated in our financial statements 
we do not have any variable interest entities that are unconsolidated in our financial statements 
we are also not involved in any non exchange traded commodity contracts accounted for at fair value 
we have no commercial commitments with related parties  except for employee loans 
contractual obligations we have contractual obligations in the form of capital and operating leases  non cancelable raw material supply arrangements and clinical research organization contracts 
the following table summarizes these contractual obligations at december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year years years more than years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations capital commitments inventory purchase obligations clinical trials total at december   we had firm capital project commitments of approximately million relating to facilities improvement 
in addition  we have budgeted significant capital expenditures for  mainly due to anticipated increased infrastructure needs and higher r d spending 
we may have more capital spending in future years 
at december   we had firm commitments to purchase active pharmaceutical ingredients 
the amounts disclosed only represent minimum purchase requirements 
actual purchases may differ significantly from these amounts 
at december   we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases 
our most significant expenditures are to contract research organizations 
although most contracts are cancelable  we generally have not cancelled contracts 
these amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to existing contracts and anticipated or potential new contracts 
recent accounting pronouncement in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of sfas sfas r supercedes apb and amends sfas  statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees and directors  including grants of stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values  beginning with the first interim or annual period after june   with early adoption permitted 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we expect to adopt sfas r in our third quarter of fiscal  beginning july  under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive options  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
we are currently evaluating the requirements of sfas r as well as option valuation methodologies related to our employee and director stock options and employee stock purchase plan 
although we have not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas r  we expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on  among other things  the levels of share based payments granted in the future  the method of adoption and the option valuation method used 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees and directors exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods related to tax deductions were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
current estimates of option values using the black scholes method may not be indicative of results from valuation methodologies ultimately adopted by gilead 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the united states as well as sales activities in europe and australia 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products 
our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and various foreign currencies  the most significant of which are the euro  the british pound and the australian dollar 
when the us dollar strengthens against these currencies  the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases 
conversely  when the us dollar weakens  the relative amounts of such sales increase 
overall  we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and  therefore  benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business 
to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on cash flows from our foreign currency sales transactions  we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency denominated net monetary assets or liabilities 
a significant percentage of our product sales are denominated in foreign currencies 
increases in the value of the us dollar against these foreign currencies in the past have reduced  and in the future may reduce  our us dollar return on these sales and negatively impact our financial condition 
prior to  we did not hedge our exposure to the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates on forecasted sales 
in january  we began to use forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales  primarily those denominated in the euro currency 
in recent years  due to the weakening of the us dollar  foreign currency exchange fluctuations have positively impacted product sales and gross margin  however  the full impact of the favorable foreign currency environment has been moderated by the hedge contracts that we had entered into 
the following table summarizes the notional amounts  average currency exchange rates and fair values of our open foreign exchange forward contracts at december  all contracts have maturities of one year or less 
average rates are stated in terms of the amount of foreign currency per us dollar 
fair values represent estimated settlement amounts at december  notional amounts and fair values in us dollars in thousands currency notional amount average rate fair value december  british pound euro australian dollar the total notional amount of million and fair value of million on our open foreign exchange forward contracts at december  compares with a total notional amount of million and fair value of million on our open foreign exchange forward contracts at december  the significant increase in outstanding contracts from to is primarily attributed to the projected increase in revenues over the forecast periods 
interest rate risk our portfolio of available for sale investment securities and our fixed rate liabilities create an exposure to interest rate risk 
with respect to the investment portfolio  we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on duration  industry group  investment type and issuer  except for securities issued by the us government 
the goals of our investment policy  in order of priority  are as follows safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk  liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements  and competitive after tax rate of return 
the following table summarizes the expected maturities and average interest rates of our fixed rate interest bearing assets and fixed rate liabilities at december  dollars in thousands 
years ending december  fair value december  thereafter total assets available for sale securities average interest rate liabilities long term obligations  including current portion average interest rate long term obligations consist of capital leases and operating leases net of noncancelable subleases 
the interest portion of payments due is included 
international credit risk our accounts receivable balance at december  was million compared to million at december  and million at december  the growth in our accounts receivable balances was primarily due to higher product sales for viread in the united states and europe 
in certain countries where payments are typically slow  primarily greece  italy  portugal and spain  our accounts receivable balances are significant 
in most cases  these slow payment practices reflect the pace at which governmental entities reimburse our customers 
this  in turn  may increase the credit risk related to certain of our customers 
sales to customers in countries that tend to be relatively slow paying have in the past increased  and in the future may further increase  the average length of time that accounts receivable are outstanding 
at december   our past due accounts receivable for greece  italy  portugal and spain totaled approximately million  of which approximately million was more than days past due 
to date  we have not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable and we believe that substantially all our accounts receivable balances are collectible 
we perform credit evaluations of our customer s financial condition and generally have not required collateral
