item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained herein 
overview fpu s strategy is to concentrate on developing stronger relationships with its customers  including builders and developers of residential and commercial properties 
fpu is positioning itself as a total energy company  not just a supplier of electricity or gas 
included in the strategy is a plan to increase the rate of future growth by concentrating on increasing customers and territory coverage using improved marketing programs  along with acquiring small energy related companies  particularly propane gas companies 
the company actively pursues opportunities to purchase small gas companies to assist in growth  as feasible opportunities arise 
results of operations general on august   fpu filed for electric rate increases and petitioned to consolidate the two electric divisions  for ratemaking purposes into one 
the request included recovery for recent increases to certain operating expenses  including pension and insurance expenses  of approximately million 
fpu went before the fpsc on february   at which time the fpsc granted the petition to consolidate the rate cases on a going forward basis and granted a million annual increase in revenue 
the effective date for the increase was march  on may  the company completed its filing with the fpsc requesting an increase in its natural gas rates and charges of approximately million 
on october  the company was granted rate relief of approximately million annually 
the interim rate relief of million became effective august   with the remaining million effective on november  the natural gas rate relief includes provisions for recovery of million for environmental liabilities included on the balance sheet as other regulatory assets  along with increased operating expenses 
in addition  fpu requested approval from the fpsc for inclusion in the rate base regulated investment the goodwill and intangible assets associated with the acquisition of atlantic utilities and was granted recovery  as an acquisition adjustment of the portion included in goodwill that represente d the difference between fair market value of the assets acquired and the original cost 
the approved acquisition adjustment amounted to approximately million  thereby allowing the company to earn a return on this investment 
revenue and gross profit gross profit is defined as gross operating revenues less fuel  conservation and unbundling costs  and revenue based taxes that are passed directly through to customers 
fpu believes that gross profit provides a more meaningful basis for evaluating utility revenue because revenue for the items passed through to customers has no effect on the results of operations and fluctuations in such costs distort the relationship of gross operating revenues between periods 
year ended december  revenue and gross profit dollars in thousands natural gas revenues cost of fuel and other pass thru costs gross profit electric revenues cost of fuel and other pass thru costs gross profit propane gas revenues cost of fuel and other pass thru costs gross profit natural gas natural gas service revenues increased million in over primarily due to a million increase in cost of fuel and other costs that were passed through to customers 
gross profit increased  or 
the primary reason for the gross profit increase was the interim rate relief beginning in august and a final increase effective november as well as normal customer growth and a increase in units sold 
a million early termination fee received in offset the increase in gross profit 
natural gas service revenues increased million in compared to  primarily due to an million increase in the cost of fuel and other costs that were passed through to customers 
natural gas gross profit increased million  or in as compared to gross profit increased primarily due to a non recurring early termination fee of million received from lake worth generation llc for the cancellation of a contract in late march fpu negotiated a new contract with the city of lake worth  which resulted in a reduction of annual revenue by  compared to the previous contract 
approximately  of the increase in gross profit in was attributable to an increase in residential and commercial customer sales 
overall  the average number of customers increased in over by due to normal growth  although this was offset by a decreas e in usage per customer  most likely due to milder weather and higher costs of gas 
electric electric service revenues increased million in over million of the increase was for the cost of fuel and other costs that were passed through to customers 
gross profit increased million or in over the increase in gross profit was primarily due to the rate increases granted in march  along with normal customer growth and a increase in units sold 
electric service revenues decreased million  or in compared to  primarily due to a million decrease in the cost of fuel and other costs that were passed through to customers 
electric gross profit increased  or in over primarily due to an increase in late fees of  customer growth was up in over due to normal growth 
this growth was offset by a decline in usage per customer most likely due to milder weather 
propane gas propane revenue increased million and gross profit increased  or in compared to the margin on propane rates charged to customers increased from the previous year 
additionally  approximately  of the gross profit increase in over is attributable to a refinement of propane inventory estimate that lowered gross profit in the third quarter of propane unit sales increased due primarily to the addition of a large wholesale customer along with an increase in the total number of customers in propane revenue increased in compared to by approximately million  primarily attributable to a million increase in the cost of gas sold 
the cost of gas sold was passed onto customers through rate increases 
propane revenue from late fees and service fees increased  propane gas gross profit increased  or  primarily due to the acquisition of a propane gas company in late and the construction and sale of two storage tanks at a lake worth high school  which contributed  to the increase 
an increase in late fees and the assessment of regulatory compliance fees beginning in the first quarter of for propane gas customers also contributed to the increase 
these increases were offset by refinement of an estimate for propane gas inventory held at customer premises in the third quarter 
in addition  the gross profit per unit s old decreased as fpu elected to reduce the profit margin for some customers in an effort to remain competitive 
the number of customers increased by primarily due to the acquisition  and usage per customer increased 
operating expenses excluding income taxes operating expenses  which include operations and taxes other than income taxes  exclude fuel costs  conservation and unbundling costs  and taxes based on revenues that are passed through to customers discussed above 
operating expenses excluding income taxes dollars in thousands year ended december  natural gas electric propane gas natural gas natural gas operating expenses  excluding income taxes  increased  or  in as compared with depreciation and amortization expense increased  due to an increase in plant assets and customer account expense increased  the increase in customer account expense in over was primarily due to a reduction  in the first quarter of  of operating expenses due to a  recovery of bad debt related to the contract with lake worth generation 
administrative expenses increased  and are discussed separately in the administrative expenses section 
other operating expense increased  partially due to an increase in underground natural gas line location expense of  that was caused by an increase in the quantity of natural gas line locations performed due to construction related projects 
the increase was offset by a decrease o f  in maintenance expenses in the first quarter of related to an abandoned construction project for a main insertion failure at royal park bridge in south florida 
natural gas operating expenses  excluding income taxes  increased million  or  in as compared with administrative expenses increased  and are discussed separately in the administrative expenses section 
other operating expense increased  partially due to an increase in underground natural gas line location expense of  that was caused by an increase in the quantity of natural gas line locations performed due to construction related projects 
other contributing factors to the increase include higher depreciation expense of  due to an increase in plant assets and an increase of  in maintenance expenses in the first quarter related to an abandoned construction project for a main insertion failure at royal park bridge in south florida 
these increases were offset by the collection of an expected bad debt of  related to the contrac t with lake worth generation in the first quarter of electric electric operating expenses  excluding income taxes  increased  or  in as compared with administrative costs  discussed below in more detail  increased  maintenance increased  primarily due to increased maintenance requiring subcontractor involvement in maintenance projects more costly than in house labor and  increase in tree trimming expense due to additional tree trimming activities that were needed to properly maintain line clearances and reduce potential outages 
customer account expense increased  electric operating expenses  excluding income taxes  increased  or  in over administrative costs  discussed below in more detail  increased  customer account expense increased  due mostly to uncollectible accounts of  and temporary staffing of  depreciation and maintenance expenses increased  and  respectively  due to increases in plant assets 
propane gas propane gas operating expenses  excluding income taxes  increased  or  in as compared with administrative expenses  discussed below  increased  and other operating expenses increased  depreciation expense also increased  due to increases in plant assets 
uncollectible accounts increased  due to increased accounts receivable 
propane gas operating expenses  excluding income taxes  increased  or  in over administrative expenses  discussed below  increased  and other operating expenses increased  primarily due to the acquisition of a company in late depreciation expense also increased  due to increases in plant assets 
administrative expenses administrative expenses increased  or  in over pension expense increased  due to the performance of the investments in the pension plan 
insurance increased  primarily due to increased medical costs 
amortization of electric rate case expense began in april and increased expense by  the company had accumulated charges earlier in relating to a potential equity offering 
due to market conditions and the company s ability to increase the line of credit to address cash needs  the potential equity offering in was cancelled in july accumulated charges of approximately  were expensed in july this was more than offset by a decrease in outside services primarily due to a change in external auditors 
administrative expenses increased million  or  in as compared to this increase was primarily caused by an increase in insurance expense of  caused by higher medical costs and increased premiums for worker s compensation and general liability 
the increase in premiums resulted from increased payroll and higher insurance rates 
pension expense increased  due to the performance of the investments in the pension plan 
additionally  other outside services increased approximately  mostly due to sarbanes oxley compliance  which required increased accounting related services 
fpu also began utilizing additional outside tax related services in total other deductions interest expense interest expense consists of interest on bonds  short term borrowings and customer deposits 
in  total interest expenses decreased  from primarily due to a decrease in interest expense on short term debt resulting from a decrease in the average outstanding loan balance on the line of credit 
in  total interest expenses decreased  from interest on short term borrowings decreased  as a result of the decrease in notes payable  offset by a decrease in interest on the allowance for funds used during construction of  as a result of completing a generation pipeline in other other consists of income and expense from the company s merchandise and services  gains or losses on disposal of property and other miscellaneous income or expenses 
the company s merchandise and services activities include the sale of merchandise as well as installation and other contract work 
merchandise and service revenue and expenses both increased in from  however merchandise profitability decreased  primarily due to increased expenses from sub contractors on increased installations and service 
non operating income increased by  in from largely due to  additional interest income associated with the sale of the water assets 
this was offset by a  adjustment in required by the fpsc to reclassify environmental interest income to the liability reserve 
merchandise and service profitability decreased approximately  in from due to changes in marketing personnel in that resulted in decreased focus on merchandise sales 
other income decreased approximately  primarily due to an adjustment required by the fpsc reclassifying interest income to the liability reserve 
in  fpu sold non utility property for a gain of  further reducing the amount of expense in compared to see discontinued operations for additional information regarding the sale of water in and the effects on the financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources portions of fpu s business are seasonal and dependent upon weather conditions in florida 
these factors affect the sale of electricity and gas and impact the cash provided by operations 
construction costs also impact cash requirements throughout the year 
cash needs for operations and construction are met partially through short term borrowings from our line of credit loc 
a line of credit is generally entered into for three years and is renewable at the end of the initial three year period 
in prior years  fpu has periodically paid off short term borrowings under lines of credit using the net proceeds from the sale of long term debt or equity securities 
the company may use these similar types of proceeds in the future to pay off short term borrowings  dependent on the amount borrowed from the loc  prevailing market conditions for debt and equity  the impact to the company s financial covenants  and the effect on income 
fpu s indenture of mortgage and deed of trust  which is a mortgage on all real and personal property  permits the issuance of additional bonds based upon a calculation of unencumbered net real and personal property 
at december   such calculation would permit the issuance of approximately million of additional bonds 
fpu issued million of palm beach county municipal bonds industrial development revenue bonds on november  to finance development in the area 
the bond proceeds were restricted and held in trust until fpu incurred construction expenditures in the county 
funds were drawn after each month s construction expenditures 
on december   the restricted funds were fully utilized for construction financing and no balance remained 
fpu has current approval from the fpsc to issue and sell and or exchange an additional amount of million in any combination of long term debt  short term notes and equity securities and or to assume liabilities or obligations as guarantor  endorser or surety  during calendar year fpu received this approval on december  during most of  fpu had a million  thirty nine month loc with the bank of america that would have expired on june  on october   fpu entered into an amended and restated loan agreement with the bank of america that increases the loc  upon days notice by the company  to a maximum of million and expires on june  the loc contains affirmative and negative covenants that  if violated  would give the bank the right to accelerate the due date of the loan to be immediately payable 
the covenants include financial ratios that must be met or exceeded 
all ratios are currently exceeded and management believes the company is in full compliance with all covenants and anticipates continued compliance 
fpu reserves million of the loc to cover expenses for any major storm repairs in its electric segment  along with reserving an additional  for a letter of credit covering propane facilities 
as of december   the amount borrowed under the loc was million 
the loc  long term debt and preferred stock as of december  comprised of total capitalization 
net cash flow provided by continuing operating activities increased in by approximately million from the increase was primarily due to the receipt of a million estimated tax payment refund received in mainly from the deferral of the gain for tax purposes on the sale of the water division in proceeds from the water assets sale of million added to net income in and were used to pay off short term debt 
a million estimated tax payment made in related to the gain on the sale of the water division 
it was subsequently determined that the income tax would be deferred see discontinued operations 
the company applied for a refund and received million in july which included other estimated tax over payments 
net cash flow provided by continuing operating activities for decreased slightly from fluctuations in the discontinued operations income  deferred income taxes  and accounts payable were mostly related to the sale of the water segment 
in  fpu had funds classified as restricted proceeds from the private activity bond acquired in late as construction progressed  the balance of these restricted proceeds decreased  and was fully unrestricted in construction expenditures increased million through december compared to december construction in increased approximately  from rebuilding two substations in the electric segment 
in addition  approximately  was spent on additional propane block systems 
in  million was spent on construction that related mostly to system expansions and replacements 
the amount was lower than the million spent in primarily due to a million contribution received in due to the early termination of a contract with lake worth generation  llc which  for accounting purposes  was treated as a reduction in construction expenditures  and approximately million of additional construction in relating to the lake worth generation project 
the company does not currently have any material commitments for construction expenditures 
long term debt has sinking fund payments that begin in the company has not been required in recent years to make contributions to the pension plan 
however  current projections show contributions being required as early as actuarial forecasts show  as a potential contribution in and  for environmental clean up is anticipated to require approximately million in the remainder to be paid in the following years 
the company expects that internally generated cash  coupled with short term borrowings  will be sufficient to satisfy its operating expenses  normal capital expenditure requirements  and dividend payments for the next one to three years 
depending upon operation requirements  environmental expenditures  pension contributions  and construction expenditures  additional financing may be needed to pay off the loc within the three year period 
the company may consider equity or debt offerings 
outlook rate proceeding on may  the company completed its filing with the fpsc requesting an increase in its natural gas rates and charges of approximately million 
on october  the company was granted final rate relief of approximately million annually 
interim rate increase of million became effective august   with the remaining million effective on november  the final natural gas rate relief includes provisions for recovery of million for environmental liabilities included on the balance sheet as other regulatory assets  along with increased operating expenses 
in addition  fpu requested approval from the fpsc for inclusion in the rate base regulated investment the goodwill and intangible assets associated with the acquisition of atlantic utilities and was granted recovery  as an acquisition adjustment  the portion included in goodwill that represented the difference between fair market value of the assets acquired and the original cost 
the approved acquisition adjustment amounted to approximately million 
the rate relief also included recovery of certain material expenditures that begin january  these include amortization of a bare steel replacement program  environmental  and rate case expenses and they will be approximately million annually 
bare steel replacement program natural gas fpu has developed a plan to replace its bare steel gas mains large pipes and associated bare steel services small pipes over a period of fifty years 
this program is needed in order to replace bare steel pipes that are susceptible to corrosion and to ensure the reliability of the company s distribution system 
the bare steel replacement program officially commenced in early and fpu plans to spend approximately  annually for the replacement program in both south florida and central florida gas distribution systems 
the natural gas rate case included the recovery of the expenditures for this program 
storm reserve the company incurred storm related expenses due to the hurricanes in and charged those expenses to storm reserves 
the storm reserves in the electric segment were sufficient to cover the amounts incurred for the hurricanes 
the natural gas segment had expenses exceeding current storm reserves and has deferred those expenses pending a request to the fpsc for recovery through a surcharge 
the company filed a natural gas petition in december with the fpsc to seek approval to recover the storm expenses relating to the hurricanes that are in excess of the existing storm reserve 
the request included an amount for a future storm reserve of  management believes the fpsc will allow recovery of the natural gas storm expenses through the special surcharge to customers over a period of time in the future 
as of december    of storm related expenditures was charged against the reserve 
this included  in capital expenditures and  related to non capital expenses 
the company had  in its natural gas storm reserves and also expects the fpsc to allow partial application of our previous natural gas over earnings to the storm reserve to cover an additional  of those storm charges 
the rema ining  of storm expenses has been classified as a regulatory asset pending future rate recovery 
the recovery of storm damages  if any  will be subject to the approval of the fpsc and is expected to be determined in if the fpsc does not approve the company s request for a special surcharge to customers or disallows a portion of the costs charged to the reserve  the expenses will increase by the disallowed portion 
as of december   the maximum expense that could affect operating income in is approximately  pension and insurance pension and insurance costs have been increasing and are expected to continue to increase 
pension increased in by  and current actuarial estimates show pension expense increasing an additional  in pension expenses are projected to continue increasing into insurance costs including medical  liability and workers compensation  have increased by  in and are expected to increase in the regulated segments have received rate relief for some of the expected pension and insurance increases 
further increases beyond those experienced through  which are allocated to the regulated segments  may require additional future rate relief 
the propane segment may recover these expenses by increasing rates depending on current market conditions in the propane industry and the ability to remain competitive 
due to significant cost increases for the company s pension plan over the past three years and with expectations that these cost increases will continue in the years ahead  the company has decided to discontinue eligibility to our pension plan for all new non union hires  and begin a new k match for new hires  effective january  this same change for unionized employees will be negotiated with our respective unions throughout and as their contracts expire 
this new k company match is cents on every dollar contributed by the employee on the first of their salary  for a total annual company contribution of up to 
the company match begins after six months of continuous service  with vesting of after three years of continuous service 
electric power supply the contracts with our two electric suppliers expire on december  the contracts currently provide fpu electricity at rates that are much lower than market rates and these savings are passed through to our customers without fpu making a profit on the fuel 
the company expects that on re negotiation of our supply contracts  below market prices will not be attainable 
the company is in discussions with the public service commission and suppliers to negotiate the best price and ways to minimize the impact of market price fuel costs to our customers in if the company enters into contracts with new suppliers additional transmission facilities will most likely have to be constructed and wheeling charges for the delivery of electricity will increase the cost of fuel 
it is anticipated that fuel costs for the divisions electric customers will increase to market prices in and that rates may begin to increase as early as in order to minimize the impact of fuel increases in the company is unable to estimate what impact  if any  higher fuel costs could have on electric consumption 
propane the company currently has propane pre buy agreements with favorable terms based on current market conditions 
the purchase of propane gas under these agreements in the first quarter of is currently expected to provide an increase to the gross profit in our propane segment of approximately  the realization of this additional gross profit depends on future market conditions affecting the cost of propane over the first quarter of these pre buy agreements are made in the normal course of procuring propane supplies 
management is currently performing a comprehensive review of the propane segment for additional ways to reduce expenses and increase revenues 
these revenues or savings  if any  would be realized during forward looking statements cautionary statement this report contains forward looking statements including those relating to the company s expectation that internally generated cash  coupled with short term borrowings  will be sufficient to satisfy its operating expense  normal capital expenditure requirements  and dividend payments for the next one to three years  that financing may be needed to pay off the loc  that the estimated value of the future value of consideration from the city relating to the sale of our water division will be realized  that the fpsc will approve recovery of the storm expenses  that pension expenses will continue to increase in  that other insurance costs will increase in  that the company will have increased gross profit due to pre buy agreements or savings in the propane segment during  and that the company expects to have higher fuel costs for and beyond 
these statements involve certain risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from what is expressed in such forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed by the forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  weather conditions  changes in laws or regulations  changes in the market environment  restrictions on fpu s ability to raise capital on favorable terms  any direct or indirect effects of terrorist threats and activities  fpu s successfully petitioning for and receiving rate increases  fpu s ability to identify attractive acquisition opportunities at favorable prices and to successfully and timely complete and integrate them 
contractual obligations payments due by period dollars in thousands less than to to more than total year years years years long term debt operating lease obligations natural gas and propane purchase obligations electric purchase obligations other purchase obligations total the long term debt obligations are principal amounts only and exclude interest 
the company utilizes blanket purchase orders for expected annual requirements to many of our suppliers 
requirements under blanket purchase orders generally do not become an obligation until specifically ordered during the year 
we also utilize specific purchase orders that are generally included as an obligation 
a purchase order is considered an obligation if it is associated with a contract or is authorizing a specific purchase of material 
the other purchase obligation amount presented above represents the value of purchase orders considered an obligation 
our pension plan continues to meet all funding requirements under erisa regulations  however  under current actuarial assumptions contributions may be required as early as actuarial forecasts show  as a potential contribution in and  for environmental clean up is anticipated to require approximately million in the remainder to be paid in the following years 
the company has medical postretirement payments relating to retiree medical insurance 
these payments are not included in the table 
estimated future payments are contained in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company has historically paid dividends 
it is fpu s intent to continue to pay quarterly dividends for the foreseeable future 
dividend policy is reviewed on an ongoing basis by fpu s board of directors and is dependent upon fpu s future earnings  cash flow  financial condition  capital requirements and other factors 
impact of recent accounting standards financial accounting standard no 
r in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r revised share based payment 
this revised statement is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  this statement primarily affects transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
the company does not feel that adoption of this revised fasb will result in any material change to our financial statements and current method of reporting stock based transactions 
the company began recording compensation expense relating to the plan in compliance with sfas no 
in the first quarter of the expense was  other critical accounting policies and estimates rate regulated basis of accounting fpu prepares its financial statements in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas no 
and it is fpu s most critical accounting policy 
in general  sfas no 
recognizes that accounting for rate regulated enterprises should reflect the relationship of costs and revenues introduced by rate regulation 
as a result  a regulated utility may defer recognition of a cost a regulatory asset or recognize an obligation a regulatory liability if it is probable that  through the rate making process  there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in revenues or expenses 
sfas no 
does not apply to the unregulated propane gas operations 
use of estimates inherent in the accounting process is the use of estimates when preparing financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
fpu uses estimates in the preparation of its financial statements including the accrual for pensions  environmental liabilities  and uninsured liability claims 
an actuary calculates the estimated pension liability in accordance with fasb environmental liabilities are subject to certain unknown future events 
fpu is self insured for the first  of each general and auto liability claim and therefore accrues for estimated losses occurring from both asserted and unasserted claims 
the estimate for unasserted claims arising from unreported incidents is based on an analysis of historical claims data and judgment 
fpu became full y insured for medical in december and will no longer require accrual of estimated claims 
management believes that the accruals for potential liabilities are adequate 
revenue recognition fpu bills utility customers on a monthly cycle basis  however  the billing cycle periods for most customers do not coincide with the accounting periods used for financial reporting 
fpu accrues estimated revenue for gas and electric customers not yet billed for a full billing cycle during the accounting period 
determination of unbilled revenue relies on the use of estimates  fuel purchases and historical data 
effects of inflation fpu s tariffs associated with its utility operating divisions provide for fuel clauses through which rates charged to customers are adjusted for changes in the cost of fuel on a reasonably current basis 
increases in other utility costs and expenses not otherwise offset by increases in revenues or reductions in other expenses could have an adverse effect on earnings due to the time lag associated with obtaining regulatory approval to recover such increased costs and expenses  the uncertainty of whether regulatory commissions will allow full recovery of such increased costs and expenses and any effect on unregulated propane gas operations 
environmental matters fpu currently uses or used in the past  in connection with its operations  several contamination sites with respect to which there is now pending or threatened environmental litigation and is in the process of investigating and assessing that litigation  see contingen cies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
fpu intends to vigorously defend its rights in this litigation 
fpu has insurance to cover a portion of any losses or expenses incurred as a result of this litigation and plans to apply to the fpsc for rate relief on any uninsured losses or expenses 
fpu believes that the aggregate of all future contamination assessment and remedial costs  legal fees and other related expenses will not exceed the combined sum of any insurance proceeds received and any rate relief granted 
the final natural gas rate relief includes pro visions for future recovery of million for environmental liabilities included on the balance sheet as other regulatory assets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all financial instruments held by fpu were entered into for purposes other than for trading 
fpu has market risk exposure only from the potential loss in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates 
fpu has no material exposure relating to commodity prices because fpu  under its regulatory jurisdictions  is fully compensated for the actual costs of commodities natural gas and electricity used in its operations 
any commodity price increases for propane gas are normally passed through monthly to propane gas customers as the fuel charge portion of their rate 
none of fpu s gas or electric contracts are accounted for using the fair value method of accounting 
while some of fpu s contracts meet the definition of a derivative  fpu has designated these contracts as normal purchases and sales under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
fpu has no exposure to equity risk  as it does not hold any equity instruments 
fpu s exposure to interest rate risk is limited to investments held for environmental costs  the water sale long term receivable and short term borrowings on the line of credit 
the investments held for environmental costs are short term fixed income debt securities whose carrying amounts are not materially different than fair value 
the short term borrowings were million at the end of december therefore  fpu does not believe it has material market risk exposure related to these instruments 
the indentures governing fpu s two first mortgage bond series outstanding contain make whole provisions  which are pre payment penalties that charge for lost interest  which render refinancing impracticable 
fpu s long term receivable non interest bearing from the sale of the water operations was discounted at 
a hypothetical basis points increase in the interest rate used would change the current fair value from million to million 
in  a hypothetical basis points decrease in the long term interest rate on million debt would change the fair value from million to million 
changes in short term interest rates could have an effect on income depending on the balance borrowed on the variable rate line of credit 
on december  and  fpu had million and million in short term debt  respectively 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in annual earnings by  and  respectively  based on year end borrowings
