products the company s products help engineers overcome the increasingly complex challenges they face in the design of electronic systems 
the company s products are designed to make design engineers more productive  improve the accuracy of complex designs and shrink time to market schedules 
electrical engineers begin the design process by describing the architectural  behavioral  functional and structural characteristics of an integrated circuit ic  a printed circuit board pcb or an electronic system 
in this process the engineer describes the overall product system architecture  implements it by creating a design description  verifies the design to reveal defects and modifies the description until it meets the previously determined design specifications 
engineers use the company s products to specify the components of the ic  pcb or electronic system  determine the interconnections among the components and define the components associated physical properties 
engineers use the company s verification products throughout the design process to identify design errors and test design alternatives before the design is manufactured 
the company s verification products are used to identify functionality and performance issues while the cost to correct is still low 
during the manufacturing process  the company s software test products are used to help identify defective parts 
scalable verification the company provides its customers critical tools for verifying that complex chip designs actually function as intended

the company markets its products and services worldwide  primarily to large companies in the military aerospace  communications  computer  consumer electronics  semiconductor  networking  multimedia and transportation industries 
through the diversification of the company s customer base among these various customer markets  the company attempts to reduce its exposure to fluctuations within each market 
the company sells and licenses its products through its direct sales force and a channel of distributors and sales representatives 
in addition to its corporate offices in wilsonville  oregon  the company has sales  support  software development and professional service offices worldwide 
business environment beginning in late  the electronics industry experienced a broad economic downturn 
since a majority of the company s business originates from electronics industry customers  the company was negatively impacted 
the semiconductor industry  a subset of the electronics industry  experienced the deepest downturn in its history 
as a result of this downturn  customers reduced research and development r d budgets  limited general investment in design tools and reduced engineering staff 
in addition  many smaller companies and start ups went out of business 
however  even in a depressed environment  customers still require the newest tools to solve leading edge design problems 
the company attempts to fill those demands through its relatively young and diverse product portfolio  and as a result  the company had a solid despite the economic troubles facing many of its customers 
for the first three quarters of  the company consumed backlog  meaning that systems and software revenue was higher than bookings 
the company decided that backlog had reached unacceptably low levels 
as a result  the company reduced revenue and earnings guidance for the fourth quarter 
the company s results for the fourth quarter accomplished management s goal of rebuilding backlog as ending backlog was approximately higher than ending backlog in the company views backlog as an important tool to mitigate forecast risk as it reduces dependency on any one customer transaction 
while the eda business environment experienced a modest improvement in  the company s management is not predicting a broad recovery of eda spending in the company will continue its strategy of developing best in class point tools with number one market share potential 
this strategy creates a diversified product portfolio for the company that solves customers critical design problems 
the company s management believes that this product strategy  in conjunction with a customer diversification strategy  has helped reduce the impact of marketplace fluctuations in the past and should continue to do so in the future 
license model mix license model trends can have a material impact on various aspects of the company s business 
see critical accounting estimates revenue recognition on pages for a description of the types of product licenses sold by the company 
as the mix among perpetual licenses  fixed term licenses term with upfront revenue recognition and term licenses with ratable revenue recognition which includes due and payable revenue recognition shifts  revenues  earnings  cash flow and days sales outstanding dso are either positively or negatively affected 
the year ended december  marked the fourth consecutive year in which  as a percentage of product revenue  term revenue increased while perpetual revenue decreased 
this trend was primarily the result of two factors 
first  the company s customers are moving toward the term license model  which provides the customer with greater flexibility for product usage  including the option to share the products between multiple locations and reconfigure consumption at regular intervals from a fixed product list 
as such  some of the company s customers have converted their existing installed base from perpetual to term licenses 
second  the weakness in the united states high technology economy has disproportionately impacted the company s smaller customers 
historically these customers have purchased under the perpetual license model 
under this ongoing shift from perpetual licenses to term licenses with upfront revenue recognition  which the company s management views as a positive trend  the company expects no measurable impact to earnings  but a negative impact on cash flow and dso 
as customers move away from perpetual licenses and into term licenses  the renewability and repeatability of the company s business is increased 
this provides opportunity for increased distribution of young products earlier in their lifecycles 
while this shift in license models may continue  the rate of movement from perpetual licenses to term licenses is expected to decrease 

table of contents product developments during  the company continued to execute its strategy of focusing on new customer problem areas  as well as building upon its well established product families 
the company s management believes that customers  faced with leading edge design challenges  choose the best products in each category to build their design environment 
through both internal development and strategic acquisitions  the company has focused on areas where it believes it can build a number one market position  or extend an existing number one market position 
the company internally developed and  in  delivered several significant products 
these new products include xtreme pcb allows simultaneous team design of a single pcb  constraint editing system for pcb  adms support for multiple languages and testbenches for analog digital design  catapult c synthesis of pure un timed c into rtl and calibre dfm functionality first tools to analyze and modify designs for increased manufacturability 
also in  the company acquired several new products or technologies 
these include assertion technology in  parallel and serial ata ip palmchip  unified modeling language for high level design of embedded software project technology  compiler development tool for embedded software atair  and low end cabling tools for wire harness vesys 
the company s management believes that the development and commercialization of eda software tools is usually a multi year process with limited customer adoption in the first years of tool availability 
once tools are adopted  however  their life spans tend to be long and healthy 
the company s management believes that the company s relatively young and diverse product lines are positioned for growth over the long term 
financial performance total revenues were  a increase over  resulting from strength in scalable verification and to a lesser extent in new and emerging markets 
revenue strength in scalable verification was paced by the analog mixed signal and modelsim product lines  while new and emerging markets strength came from the company s cabling and embedded systems product lines 
system and software revenues were  a increase over system and software revenues of  product revenue split by license model was term with upfront revenue recognition  perpetual and term with ratable revenue recognition which includes due and payable revenue recognition  compared to product revenue splits of term with upfront revenue recognition  perpetual and term with ratable revenue recognition 
term product revenue with upfront revenue recognition increased to  as compared to  in service and support revenues were  a increase over service and support revenues of  primarily due to the strengthening of certain foreign currencies and the growth in our installed base 
by geography  year over year revenues decreased in the americas  and increased in europe  in japan and in pacific rim 
the americas contributed the largest share of revenues at nearly  down from in japan and pacific rim regions increased their percentage of total revenues to and  respectively  in as compared to and  respectively  in net loss for was  compared to a net income of  in increased revenues in were partially offset by increased operating expenses

the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company evaluates its estimates on an on going basis 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following are the critical accounting estimates and judgments used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company reports revenue in two categories based upon how the revenue is generated i system and software and ii service and support 

table of contents system and software revenue system and software revenues are derived from the sale of licenses of software products and emulation hardware systems 
the company licenses software using two different license types term licenses are for a specified time period  typically three years with payments spread over the license term  and do not provide the customer with the right to use the product after the end of the term 
the company generally recognizes product revenue from term installment license agreements upon shipment and start of the license term 
the company uses these agreements as a standard business practice and has a history of successfully collecting under the original payment terms without making concessions on payments  products or services 
if the company no longer had a history of collecting without providing concessions on term agreements  then revenue would be required to be recognized as the payments become due and payable over the license term 
this change would have a material impact on the company s near term results of operations 
in a situation in which a risk of concession may exist on a term license agreement  revenue is recognized on a due and payable basis  which is the lesser of the ratable portion of the entire fee or the customer installments as they become due and payable 
in a term license agreement where the company provides the customer with rights to unspecified or unreleased future products  revenue is recognized ratably over the license term 
perpetual licenses provide the customer with the right to use the product in perpetuity and typically do not provide for extended payment terms 
the company recognizes product revenue from perpetual license agreements upon delivery to the customer when the likelihood of product return is remote 
if the agreement provides for customer payment terms that are different than the standard payment terms in the customer s jurisdiction  product revenue is recognized as payments become due and payable 
service and support revenue service and support revenues consist of revenues from support contracts and professional services  which include consulting services  training services and other services 
the company records service revenue as the services are provided to the customer 
support revenue is recognized over the support term 
for multi element arrangements that include support  support is allocated based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of support 
for term licenses  vsoe is established by the price charged when such support is offered as optional during the license term 
for perpetual licenses  vsoe is established by the price charged when such support is sold separately 
the company determines whether software product revenue recognition is appropriate based upon the evaluation of whether the following four criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists an agreement signed by the customer and the company

fee is fixed or determinable the amount of the fee and the due date have been fixed at execution of the arrangement without the possibility of future adjustments or concessions 
collectibility is probable the customer is expected to pay for products or services without the company providing future concessions to the customer 
valuation of trade accounts receivable the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts on trade accounts receivable and term receivables  long term for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company regularly evaluates the collectibility of its trade accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
when it becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  such as in the case of bankruptcy or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  a specific reserve for bad debt is recorded to reduce the related receivable to the amount believed to be collectible 
the company also records unspecified reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors including length of time the receivables are past due  the financial health of the customers  the current business environment and historical experience 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  estimates of the recoverability of receivables would be adjusted resulting in either additional selling expense or a reduction in selling expense in the period such determination was made 
valuation of deferred tax assets deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized 
the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event the company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase either income or contributed capital  or decrease goodwill  in the period such determination was made 
also  if the company was to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to increase the valuation allowance on such net deferred tax assets would be charged to expense or contributed capital in the period such determination was made 

table of contents income tax reserves the company has reserves for taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by taxing authorities  even though the company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are appropriate

the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and in numerous foreign jurisdictions and in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets and the related intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of an asset is determined by comparing its carrying amount  including any associated intangible assets  to the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the asset relates 
if the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets  then intangible assets are written down first  followed by the other long lived assets of the operation  to fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values  depending upon the nature of the assets 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an impairment indicator using a fair value approach 
in the event that  in the future  it is determined that the company s goodwill  intangible or other long lived assets have been impaired  an adjustment would be made that would result in a charge for the write down in the period that determination was made 
inventory the company purchases and commits to purchase inventory based upon forecasted shipments of its emulation hardware systems 
the company evaluates  on a quarterly basis  the need for inventory reserves based on projections of systems expected to ship within six months 
reserves for excess and obsolete inventory are established to account for the differences between forecasted shipments and the amount of purchased and committed inventory 
the company also has emulation hardware system demonstration and loan equipment at customer locations in anticipation of securing sales 
the cost of the emulation hardware system demonstration and loan equipment is amortized to selling expense over the lesser of the loan period or six months

the company has recorded restructuring charges in connection with employee rebalances based on estimates of the expected costs associated with severance benefits 
if the actual cost incurred exceeds the estimated cost  additional special charges will be recognized 
if the actual cost is less than the estimated cost  a benefit to special charges will be recognized 
the company has also recorded restructuring charges in connection with excess leased facilities to offset future rent  net of estimated sublease income that could be reasonably obtained  of the abandoned office space and to write off leasehold improvements on abandoned office space 
the company worked with external real estate experts in each of the markets where properties are located to obtain assumptions used to determine the best estimate of the net loss 
the company s estimates of expected sublease income could change based on factors that affect the company s ability to sublease those facilities such as general economic conditions and the real estate market 
if the real estate markets worsen and the company is not able to sublease the properties as expected  additional adjustments may be required  which would result in additional special charges in the period such determination was made 
likewise  if the real estate market strengthens and the company is able to sublease the properties earlier or at more favorable rates than projected  a benefit to special charges will be recognized

deferred tax assets consist of net operating loss carryforwards in several tax jurisdictions  including the united states  credit carryovers and timing differences between book and tax income 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the provision for income taxes for the year differs from tax computed at the federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to the impact of a large dividend declared by a foreign subsidiary  an increase in the valuation allowance on united states deferred tax assets  the impact of state taxes and the amortization of a deferred tax charge recorded in  offset in part by the impact of the tax rate differential on earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
tax expense of  net of associated foreign tax credits  was provided on the declaration of a  dividend from a foreign subsidiary in for which provisions of the american jobs creation act of do not apply

in  the company transferred certain technology rights acquired in the ati  ikos and innoveda acquisitions to one of its wholly owned foreign subsidiaries in a transaction that was projected to generate approximately  of taxable gain for federal and state income tax purposes over the next three years  with approximately  recognized in due to the intercompany nature of the transfer  the associated income tax expense was to be recorded over a three year period  and  of expense was recorded in the remaining federal and state income tax expense of  was recorded as a deferred tax charge included in other assets to be amortized to the book provision for income taxes over the remaining years 
the recognition of a taxable gain in the united states allowed the company to utilize domestic deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance had previously been taken 
accordingly  primarily as a result of the intercompany sale  the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets decreased by  in  with  of the related benefit being applied directly to contributed capital as a tax benefit of stock option exercises 
in  the company reduced the amount payable by its foreign subsidiary for the transfer of ikos technology rights by approximately  this was due to declining emulation revenue primarily attributable to lower prices paid by customers as a result of intense competition and the weakened economy 
as a result of the corresponding decrease in the projected taxable gain  the deferred tax charge recorded in for this transaction was reduced by  the decrease in projected income tax expense from this transaction resulted in the restoration of  of deferred tax assets that were not utilized under the revised transaction 
the amortization of deferred tax charge for and was  the remaining balance of the deferred tax charge as of december  was  under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
sfas no 
provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets without a valuation allowance if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based on the weight of available evidence  the company has provided a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets 
a portion of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets relates to the difference between financial and tax reporting of employee stock option exercises  for which subsequently recognized tax benefits will be applied directly to increase contributed capital 
a portion of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets relates to certain of the tax attributes acquired from ikos and in  for which subsequently recognized tax benefits will be applied directly to reduce goodwill 
the remainder of the valuation allowance was based on the historical earnings patterns within individual taxing jurisdictions that make it uncertain that the company will have sufficient income in the appropriate jurisdictions to realize the full value of the assets 
the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
the company had net deferred tax assets of  at december   a decrease of  from december  this decrease was a result of current year utilization of deferred tax assets in connection with the  dividend from a foreign subsidiary  the recording of deferred tax liabilities identified in the purchase accounting for the in acquisition with a corresponding increase to goodwill and the utilization of deferred tax assets from the settlement of an examination with the internal revenue service for the company s united states federal income tax returns for the years and also during  the company determined it is uncertain whether the company s united states entities will generate sufficient taxable income and foreign source income to utilize foreign tax credit carryforwards  research and experimentation credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards before expiration 
accordingly  the company recorded valuation allowances against the portion of those deferred tax assets for which realization is uncertain  resulting in a  net increase in valuation allowances and a corresponding decrease in net deferred tax assets 
the company has reserves for taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by taxing authorities  even though the company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are appropriate 
the tax reserves are reviewed as circumstances warrant and adjusted as events occur that affect the company s potential liability for additional taxes 
the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and in numerous foreign jurisdictions and in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
during  the company settled an examination with the internal revenue service for its united states federal income tax returns for the years and the results of this exam have been reflected in the deferred tax asset balances and taxes payable balances as of december  there was no impact on tax expense because  as a result of audit findings  an additional assessment of tax liability for the audit period had been adequately provided for in previous periods 
see factors that may affect future results and financial condition below 
in addition  the company is currently under examination by the irs for its and federal income tax returns 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  the company believes the tax reserves are adequate to cover any potential liabilities that could result from the current examinations 

table of contents effects of foreign currency fluctuations more than half of the company s revenues and approximately one fourth of its expenses were generated outside of the united states in for and  approximately one fourth of european and all japanese revenues were subject to exchange rate fluctuations as they were recorded in local currencies 
most large european revenue contracts are denominated and paid to the company in the united states dollar while the company s european expenses  including substantial research and development operations  are paid in local currencies causing a short position in the euro and the british pound sterling 
in addition  the company experiences greater inflows than outflows of japanese yen as substantially all japanese based customers contract and pay the company in local currency 
while these exposures are aggregated on a consolidated basis to take advantage of natural offsets  substantial exposure remains 
for exposures that are not offset  the company enters into short term foreign currency forward and option contracts to partially offset these anticipated exposures 
the option contracts are generally entered into at contract strike rates that are different than current market rates 
as a result  any unfavorable currency movements below the strike rates will not be offset by the foreign currency option contract and could negatively affect operating results 
these contracts address anticipated future cash flows for periods up to one year and do not hedge of the potential exposures related to these currencies 
as a result  the effects of currency fluctuations could have a substantial effect on the company s overall results of operations

the company anticipates that current cash balances  anticipated cash flows from operating activities  including the effects of financing customer term receivables  and amounts available under existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its working capital needs on a short term and long term basis

actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in forward looking statements 
the company disclaims any obligation to update forward looking statements to reflect future events or revised expectations 
the following discussion highlights factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the company s forward looking statements 
forward looking statements should be considered in light of these factors 
weakness in the united states and international economies may materially adversely affect the company 
united states and international economies can experience economic downturns  which may have an adverse affect on the company s results of operations 
weakness in these economies may adversely affect the timing and receipt of orders for the company s products and the company s results of operations 
revenue levels are dependent on the level of technology capital spending  which include expenditures for eda software  hardware and consulting services  in the united states and abroad 
in addition  demand for the company s products and services may be adversely affected by mergers and company restructurings in the electronics industry worldwide which could result in decreased or delayed capital spending patterns 
the company is subject to the cyclical nature of the integrated circuit and electronics systems industries and any future downturns may  materially adversely affect the company 
purchases of the company s products and services are highly dependent upon new design projects initiated by customers in the integrated circuit and electronics systems industries 
these industries are highly cyclical and are subject to constant and rapid technological change  rapid product obsolescence  price erosion  evolving standards  short product life cycles and wide 
table of contents fluctuations in product supply and demand 
the integrated circuit and electronics systems industries regularly experience significant downturns  often connected with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles of companies in these industries and their customers products and a decline in general economic conditions 
these downturns cause diminished product demand  production overcapacity  high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
during such downturns  the number of new design projects generally decreases  which can adversely affect demand for the company s products and services 
over the past several years  ic manufacturers and electronics systems companies have experienced a downturn in demand and production  which has resulted in reduced research and development spending by many of the company s customers 
while many of these companies appear to have experienced a gradual recovery in the second half of and in  they have continued their focus on cost containment 
any economic downturn could harm the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
fluctuations in quarterly results of operations due to the timing of significant orders and the mix of licenses used to sell the company s products could hurt the company s business and the market price of the company s common stock 
the company has experienced  and may continue to experience  varied quarterly operating results 
various factors affect the company s quarterly operating results and some of these are not within the company s control  including customer demand  the timing of significant orders and the mix of licenses used to sell the company s products 
the company receives a majority of its software product revenue from current quarter order performance  of which a substantial amount is usually booked in the last few weeks of each quarter 
a significant portion of the company s revenue comes from multi million dollar contracts  the timing of the completion of and the terms of delivery of which can have a material impact on revenue recognition for a given quarter 
if the company fails to receive expected orders in a particular quarter  particularly large orders  the company s revenues for that quarter could be adversely affected 
in such an event  the company could fail to meet investors expectations  which could adversely affect the company s stock price 
the company uses fixed term license agreements as a standard business practice 
these multi year  multi element term license agreements are typically three years in length  with customers the company believes are credit worthy  and have payments spread over the license term 
the complexity of these agreements tends to increase the risk associated with collectibility from customers that can arise for a variety of reasons including ability to pay  product dissatisfaction  disagreements and disputes 
if the company is unable to collect under any of these multi million dollar agreements  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected 
the company uses these fixed term license agreements as a standard business practice and has a history of successfully collecting under the original payment terms without making concessions on payments  products or services 
if the company no longer had a history of collecting without providing concessions on term agreements  then revenue would be required to be recognized as the payments become due and payable over the license term 
this change would have a material impact on the company s results 
the company s revenue is also affected by the mix of licenses entered into where the company recognizes software product revenue as payments become due and payable or ratably over the license term as compared to revenue recognized at the beginning of the license term 
the company recognizes revenue ratably over the license term when the customer is provided with rights to unspecified or unreleased future products 
a shift in the license mix toward increased ratable or due and payable revenue recognition would result in increased deferral of software product revenue to future periods and would decrease current revenue  possibly resulting in the company not meeting revenue expectations 
the gross margin on the company s software products is greater than that for the company s hardware products  software support and professional services 
therefore  the company s gross margin may vary as a result of the mix of products and services sold 
additionally  the margin on software products varies year to year depending on the amount of third party royalties due to third parties from the company for the mix of products sold 
the company also has a significant amount of fixed or relatively fixed costs  such as professional service employee costs and purchased technology amortization  and costs which are committed in advance and can only be adjusted periodically 
as a result  a small failure to reach planned revenue would likely have a relativity large negative effect on resulting earnings 
if anticipated revenue does not materialize as expected  the company s gross margins and operating results would be materially adversely affected 
accounting rules governing revenue recognition may change the accounting rules governing software revenue recognition have been subject to authoritative interpretations that have generally made it more difficult to recognize software product revenue at the beginning of the license period 
if this trend continues  new and revised standards and interpretations could adversely affect the company s ability to meet revenue expectations 
forecasting the company s tax rates is complex and subject to uncertainty 
forecasts of the company s income tax position and resultant effective tax rate are complex and subject to uncertainty as the company s income tax position for each year combines a the effects of a mix of profits losses earned by the company and its subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates  b benefits from available deferred tax assets  c taxes  interest or penalties resulting from tax audits and d changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws 
in order to forecast the company s global tax rate  pre tax profits and losses by jurisdiction are estimated and tax expense by jurisdiction is calculated 
if the mix of profits and losses or effective tax rates by jurisdiction are different than those estimates  the company s actual tax rate could be materially different than forecast 

table of contents new accounting standard related to equity compensation will cause the company to recognize an additional expense  which will result in a reduction in the company s net income 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which replaces sfas no

this statement requires the company to record a charge to compensation expense for stock option grants

 the company has elected to use the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  to measure compensation expense for stock based awards granted to employees  under which the granting of stock options is not considered compensation if the option exercise price is not less than the fair market value of the common stock at the grant date 
starting in july  the fasb s statement will require that stock based awards be accounted for using a fair value based method  which would require the company to measure the compensation expense for all such awards  including stock options  at fair value at the grant date 
the company is evaluating the requirements of sfas no 
r and expects that the adoption will have a material adverse effect on the company s net income 
the company s business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance  which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 
because the company s common stock is publicly traded on the nasdaq stock market  the company is subject to rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self regulated organizations  including the sec  nasdaq and the public company accounting oversight board  which monitors the accounting practices of public companies 
many of these regulations have only recently been enacted  and continue to evolve  making compliance more difficult and uncertain 
in particular  section of sarbanes oxley act of and related regulations have required the company to include a management assessment of the company s internal controls over financial reporting and auditor attestation of that assessment in this annual report for the company s fiscal year ending december  this effort has required  and continues to require  the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
a failure to complete a favorable assessment and obtain our auditors attestation could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 
outcome of internal revenue service and other tax authorities examinations could have a material adverse affect on the company 
the internal revenue service and other tax authorities regularly examine the company s income tax returns 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes 
in determining the adequacy of our income taxes  the company assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from the internal revenue service and other tax authorities examinations 
the ultimate outcome of these examinations cannot be predicted with certainty 
should the internal revenue service or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of examinations  the company may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material impact on the results of operations  financial position or cash flows in the applicable period or periods recorded 
limitations on the effectiveness of controls 
the company does not expect that its disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the control system s objectives will be met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within the company have been detected 
failure of the company s control systems to prevent error or fraud could materially adversely impact the company 
the lengthy sales cycle for the company s products and services  and delay in customer consummation of projects  makes the timing of the company s revenue difficult to predict 
the company has a lengthy sales cycle that generally extends between three and six months 
the complexity and expense associated with the company s products and services generally requires a lengthy customer evaluation and approval process 
consequently  the company may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenue and may prevent the company from pursuing other opportunities 
in addition  sales of the company s products and services may be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of projects because of customers budgetary constraints  internal acceptance review procedures  timing of budget cycles or timing of competitive evaluation processes 

table of contents any loss of the company s leadership position in certain portions of the eda market could have a material adverse affect on the company 
the industry in which the company competes is characterized by very strong leadership positions in specific portions of the eda market 
for example  one company may enjoy a large percentage of sales in the physical verification portion of the market while another will have a similarly strong position in mixed signal simulation 
these strong leadership positions can be maintained for significant periods of time as the software is difficult to master and customers are disinclined to make changes once their employees  as well as others in the industry  have developed familiarity with a particular software product 
for these reasons  much of the company s profitability arises from niche areas in which it is the strong leader 
conversely  it is difficult for the company to achieve significant profits in niche areas where other companies are the leaders 
if for any reason the company loses its leadership position in a niche  the company could be materially adversely affected 
intense competition in the eda industry could materially adversely affect the company 
competition in the eda industry is intense  which can lead to  among other things  price reductions  longer selling cycles  lower product margins  loss of market share and additional working capital requirements 
the company s success depends upon the company s ability to acquire or develop and market products and services that are innovative and cost competitive and that meet customer expectations 
the company currently competes primarily with two large companies cadence design systems  inc and synopsys  inc 
the company also competes with numerous smaller companies  a number of which have combined with other eda companies 
the company also competes with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed  or have the capability to develop  their own eda products internally 
the company may acquire other companies and may not successfully integrate them or the companies the company has recently acquired 
the industry in which the company competes has seen significant consolidation in recent years 
during this period  the company has acquired numerous businesses  and it is frequently in discussions with potential acquisition candidates and may acquire other businesses in the future 
while the company expects to carefully analyze all potential transactions before committing to them  the company cannot assure that any transaction that is completed will result in long term benefits to the company or its shareholders or that the company s management will be able to manage the acquired businesses effectively 
in addition  growth through acquisition involves a number of risks 
if any of the following events occurs after the company acquires another business  it could materially adversely affect the company difficulties in combining previously separate businesses into a single unit  the substantial diversion of management s attention from day to day business when evaluating and negotiating acquisition transactions and then integrating the acquired business  the discovery after the acquisition has been completed of liabilities assumed with the acquired business  the failure to realize anticipated benefits  such as cost savings and revenue increases  the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business  difficulties related to assimilating the products of an acquired business in  for example  distribution  engineering and customer support areas  unanticipated costs  adverse effects on existing relationships with suppliers and customers  and failure to understand and compete effectively in markets in which we have limited previous experience 
acquired businesses may not perform as projected  which could result in impairment of acquisition related intangible assets 
additional challenges include integration of sales channels  training and education of the sales force for new product offerings  integration of product development efforts  integration of systems of internal controls and integration of information systems 
accordingly  in any acquisition there will be uncertainty as to the achievement and timing of projected synergies  cost savings and sales levels for acquired products 
all of these factors can impair the company s ability to forecast  meet revenue and earnings targets and manage effectively the company s business for long term growth 
the company cannot assure that it can effectively meet these challenges 
risks of international operations and the effects of foreign currency fluctuations can adversely impact the company s business and operating results 
the company realizes more than half of the company s revenue from customers outside the united states and approximately one fourth of the company s expenses are generated outside of the united states 
significant changes in exchange rates can have an adverse effect on the company 
for further discussion of foreign currency effects  see effects of foreign currency 
table of contents fluctuations discussion above 
in addition  international operations subject the company to other risks including longer receivables collection periods  changes in a specific country s or region s economic or political conditions  trade protection measures  import or export licensing requirements  loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs  limitations on repatriation of earnings and difficulties with licensing and protecting the company s intellectual property rights 
delay in production of components or the ordering of excess components for the company s mentor emulation division hardware products could materially adversely affect the company 
the success of the company s mentor emulation division depends on the company s ability to procure hardware components on a timely basis from a limited number of suppliers  assemble and ship systems on a timely basis with appropriate quality control  develop distribution and shipment processes  manage inventory and related obsolescence issues and develop processes to deliver customer support for hardware 
the company s inability to be successful in any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect the company 
the company commits to purchase component parts from suppliers based on sales forecasts of the company s mentor emulation division products 
if the company cannot change or be released from these non cancelable purchase commitments  or if orders for the company s products do not materialize as anticipated  the company could incur significant costs related to the purchase of excess components which could become obsolete before the company can use them 
additionally  a delay in production of the components could materially adversely affect the company s operating results 
the company s failure to adequately protect the company s proprietary rights or to obtain software or other intellectual property licenses could materially adversely affect the company 
the company s success depends  in large part  upon the company s proprietary technology 
the company generally relies on patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws  licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect the company s proprietary rights in technology and products 
despite precautions the company may take to protect the company s intellectual property  the company cannot assure that third parties will not try to challenge  invalidate or circumvent these protections 
the companies in the eda industry  as well as entities and persons outside the industry  are obtaining patents at a rapid rate 
as a result  the company may on occasion be forced to engage in costly patent litigation to protect the company s rights or defend our customers rights 
the company may also need to settle these claims on terms that are unfavorable  such settlements could result in the payment of significant damages or royalties  or force the company to stop selling or redesign one or more products 
the company cannot assure that the rights granted under the company s patents will provide it with any competitive advantage  that patents will be issued on any of the company s pending applications or that future patents will be sufficiently broad to protect the company s technology 
furthermore  the laws of foreign countries may not protect the company s proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as united states law protects these rights in the united states 
some of the company s products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties  and the company may have to seek new licenses or renew existing licenses for software and other intellectual property in the future 
the company s failure to obtain software or other intellectual property licenses or rights on favorable terms could materially adversely affect the company 
future litigation may materially adversely affect the company 
any future litigation may result in injunctions against future product sales and substantial unanticipated legal costs and divert the efforts of management personnel  any and all of which could materially adversely affect the company
