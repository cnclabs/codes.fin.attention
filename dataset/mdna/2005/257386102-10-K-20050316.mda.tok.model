item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading builder of high quality homes in central ohio primarily the columbus metropolitan statistical area and louisville  kentucky 
during  we entered the lexington  kentucky market 
our customer driven focus targets entry level and move up home buyers 
we offer a variety of homes that are differentiated by price  size  standard features and available options 
our homes range in price from approximately  to more than  and in size from approximately  to  square feet 
net income for the twelve months ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the twelve months ended december  net income for the year was the third best in our company s history  however  lower sales  higher costs of real estate sold  adjustments to land inventory values of approximately million and increased selling  general and administrative expenses negatively impacted our results compared to the prior year 
we sold  homes during  representing a sales value of million  compared to  homes sold during  representing a sales value of million 
during  we delivered  homes with revenues of million  compared to  homes with revenues of million during our backlog at december  was sales contracts  with an aggregate sales value of million  compared to  sales contracts with an aggregate sales value of million at year end the average price of homes in backlog at year end was  compared to  for the prior year 
revenues from our mortgage financing services subsidiary for declined to million from million for the prior year due to the fewer number of homes sold during and a lower capture rate for during  we provided mortgage financing services for approximately  of our customers  representing approximately of our deliveries  compared to providing financing services for approximately  of our customers  representing approximately of our deliveries during the mortgage financing services capture rate declined primarily due to competitive financing services provided by other lenders and organizational changes occurring within the mortgage financing services subsidiary 
in late and early  we began to implement plans to increase the number of communities in both central ohio and louisville  kentucky and to expand our operations into the lexington  kentucky market 
these decisions were based on record sales achieved over the previous several years which continued through the first quarter of as a result  we increased our number of active communities to at december  compared to at december  we also increased our investment in land and land development based on the expected growth in our home sales 
beginning in the second quarter of  however  we experienced a drop off in our home sales in each of our markets  which resulted in lower revenue from home sales and reduced absorption of our land inventory 
we believe that this drop off  in part  was reflective of a general downturn in new home sales in the midwest markets 
in addition  our central ohio home building operation s overall market share of homes delivered declined to 
table of contents approximately in compared to approximately in based on new homes closed 
for the year ended december   we had an approximately market share for homes in the  to  range  an approximately market share for homes in the  to  range and an approximately market share for homes in the  to  range in our central ohio market 
for the year ended december   we had an approximately market share for homes in the  to  range and an approximately market share for homes in the  to  range and an approximately market share for homes in the  to  range in our central ohio market 
this market share information is based on an annual housing market report for and prepared by a columbus  ohio based real estate service that compiles data on market share based on new homes delivered in the columbus msa the columbus market report  and which is not affiliated with the company 
in response to this decline in demand for our new homes  we implemented several initiatives targeted at improving sales and reducing our overhead expenses 
during the second half of  we developed additional incentives for real estate brokers and launched specific and targeted direct marketing campaigns designed to more effectively reach our potential customer base 
we also redesigned our company website to more effectively market our homes and communities to internet users 
we reduced the number of full time employees from a high of in may of to at december   mostly through attrition  and undertook additional cost saving initiatives 
these efforts resulted in a reduction in our fourth quarter selling  general and administrative expenses compared to the same period the previous year  after eliminating the variable sales expense associated with selling fewer homes 
during  we intend to reduce our speculative home inventory and slow land development for some land not already in the development process or land not required for immediate use 
we are continuing to develop communities already in progress  including six new communities in premier locations that we anticipate will be well received by homebuyers 
we presently have a larger investment in land  particularly developed lots  than is desirable in view of the reduced demand 
in order to partially address this problem  during we sold land with a historical cost of approximately million and charged to earnings approximately million primarily consisting of deposits and due diligence expenses on land that we decided not to purchase 
however  due to commitments already in place  we expect our investment in land to increase during these commitments include the purchase and development of new communities that we believe will incrementally benefit our home sales 
we anticipate that the strategic actions we have implemented will position the company for future growth and profitability 
however  due to the low number of sales contracts in backlog at december   we do not expect to achieve a profit in the first quarter of we anticipate that overall will be a profitable year  but that net income will be lower than in recent years 
business risks we desire to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the pslra 
this annual report on form k contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of the pslra and other applicable 
table of contents securities laws 
such statements can be identified by the use of the forward looking words anticipate  estimate  project  believe  intend  expect  hope or similar words 
these statements discuss future expectations  contain projections regarding future developments  operations or financial conditions  or state other forward looking information 
these forward looking statements involve various important risks  uncertainties and other factors which could cause our actual results for and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
included among such important risks  uncertainties and other factors are the following our business is cyclical and significantly affected by changes in national and local economic  business and other conditions  most of which are beyond our control 
these conditions include short and long term interest rates  changes in governmental regulations  employment levels and job growth  availability and affordability of mortgage financing for home buyers  availability and cost of building lots  availability of materials including lumber and labor  fluctuating costs of materials and labor  adverse weather conditions and natural disasters  consumer confidence and housing demand  competitive overbuilding  changing demographics  cost overruns  changes in tax laws  changes in local government fees  and availability and cost of rental property and resale prices of existing homes 
in addition  domestic terrorist attacks and the threat or the involvement of the united states in international armed conflict may also adversely affect general economic conditions  consumer confidence and the homebuilding markets 
we operate in a limited number of geographic areas 
we conduct our operations only in central ohio  louisville  kentucky and lexington  kentucky 
our lack of geographic diversity means that adverse general economic or weather conditions in one or more of these markets could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
the nature of the homebuilding process makes it difficult to quickly respond to rapid changes in housing demand 
once we have begun the development of a new community  it is difficult and  at times  impractical  to discontinue development activities 
thus  we may be forced to incur costs associated with land development which began at a time of high housing demand even if the demand for newly constructed homes later decreases 
conversely  if there is a sudden increase in the demand for our homes  we may not be able to fully take advantage of the increased demand if we have not begun land development and acquisition activities on a sufficient number of communities 

table of contents interest rate increases or changes in federal lending programs could adversely affect sales of our homes 
virtually all purchasers of our homes finance their purchase through third party lenders who offer conventional and government insured mortgage financing 
a material increase in mortgage interest rates or unfavorable changes to these lending programs would adversely affect the ability of prospective home buyers  particularly our targeted entry level home buyers  to obtain mortgage financing 
we also depend on the availability and cost of mortgage financing for buyers of the current homes owned by potential purchasers of our homes 
prior to purchasing our homes  some of our home buyers must sell their current homes  and these sales depend on the availability and cost of mortgage financing 
in addition  because many of our home buyers use government insured mortgage financing  a material reduction in the scope or funding of government insured mortgage programs could have a material adverse effect on our sales 
in particular  a substantial number of our home buyers use down payment assistance programs  which allow home buyers to receive gift funds from non profit corporations to be used as a down payment 
at one time  hud proposed rules which would have prohibited the use of gift fund programs in conjunction with government insured mortgage loans 
hud subsequently withdrew these proposed rules  but has continued to increase its regulation of gift fund programs 
if hud were to prohibit or make materially unfavorable changes to the use of gift fund programs  we would expect to offer  as we have in the past  a different type of down payment program 
there can be no assurance  however  that any such replacement program would be as attractive to home buyers as the programs offered today and that our sales would not suffer 
our business is subject to substantial government regulation which could cause delays  increase costs  and restrict or prohibit homebuilding activity in certain regions 
we are subject to substantial local  state and federal requirements concerning zoning  resource protection  building design and construction  and similar matters 
these requirements include local regulations  which impose restrictive zoning and density requirements to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular location 
particularly in the case of local political subdivisions  anti growth sentiments can lead to ballot measures that can interfere with or impede our ability to develop land or build homes 
candidates for local office who favor restrictions on growth and development are being elected with greater frequency in certain communities in which the company conducts business 
restrictive measures can also affect construction activities  including construction materials  which must be used in home construction  as well as sales activities and other dealings with home buyers 
we also must obtain licenses  permits and approvals from various governmental agencies for our development activities  the granting of which are beyond our control 
obtaining acceptable zoning and overcoming objections of neighborhood groups and citizen activists is becoming more difficult  time consuming and expensive 
these issues may adversely affect the company in the future 
we also are subject to a variety of local  state and federal requirements concerning the protection of health and the environment 
the particular environmental laws  which apply to any given project  vary greatly according to the project site and the present and former uses of the 
table of contents property 
these environmental laws may result in delays and cause us to incur substantial compliance costs  including substantial expenditures for pollution and water quality control 
these laws may prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions 
in an effort to avoid major environmental issues in our developments  we have a general practice of requiring environmental reports from qualified  independent professionals and resolution of identified environmental issues prior to purchasing land 
however  it is possible that we may incur material liabilities relating to the removal of toxic wastes or other environmental matters affecting land we have acquired 
building moratoria may result in periodic delays or may preclude us from developing certain projects 
these moratoria generally result from insufficient water supplies or sewer facilities  delays in utility hookups  inadequate road capacity  environmental concerns  school system overcrowding or financial difficulties  or anti growth sentiment within a specific market area or community 
time limited moratoria or restrictions on zoning changes  building permit issuance and extensions of utilities in certain areas have been adopted by several communities in which the company develops land and builds homes  and similar restrictive measures have been considered by other communities in which the company conducts business 
these moratoria can occur before or after we start our operations and without notice or recourse 
our success depends on the availability of undeveloped land that is suitable for our development 
our business strategy is to be the developer in substantially all of the communities in which we build homes 
therefore  our short and long term financial success depends and will continue to depend on our ability to acquire land  adjust our strategy for purchasing land  address changing market conditions and develop communities successfully 
we commit substantial financial and managerial resources to acquire land and develop the streets  utility services and other infrastructure before any revenue is generated from the community 
we may acquire and develop land upon which we cannot  or choose not to  build or sell homes 
the market value of undeveloped land and building lots fluctuates 
we also build some homes before we obtain non cancelable sale contracts for those homes 
we may have to hold these unsold inventory homes for an indefinite time prior to a sale 
in addition  because market prices fluctuate  we may have to sell inventory homes at a loss 
adverse weather conditions may prevent or delay the construction of homes and reduce the number of home sales 
poor weather conditions can hinder our construction and development activities  and thereby increase the cost of constructing our homes and delay the closing of our homes and our recognition of revenue from such closings 
in addition  in cases of prolonged severe weather  potential home buyers may delay or forgo the purchase of a home 
delays in construction of our homes could cause mortgage commitments to expire 
delays in the construction of a home could cause the mortgage commitment to expire and could require us  if mortgage interest rates have increased  to pay significant amounts to the mortgage lender to extend the original mortgage interest rates 
we are significantly leveraged and depend on the availability of financing 
we incur significant up front expenditures for land acquisition  development and construction costs 
we have traditionally financed these costs with bank borrowings  internally generated funds and joint venture arrangements 
although we have not in recent years experienced problems in 
table of contents obtaining financing  we cannot be sure that continued financing will be available to us in the future  or that any financing available to us will be on favorable terms 
our ability to make payments of principal or interest on  or to refinance our indebtedness  will depend on our future operating performance and successful execution of our business strategy 
our expansion strategies may adversely effect our operations 
from time to time  we evaluate opportunities to expand into new markets  whether through acquisitions or start up operations 
any expansion strategy involves many risks 
new markets may prove to be less stable than our current markets and may result in delays  problems and expenses not typically encountered in our current markets 
regulations in various states may prohibit or impede us from using some of our community development strategies  such as those utilized with the independence series that require condominium or other high density housing 
we may fail to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions on acceptable terms 
the magnitude  timing and nature of acquisitions will depend upon various factors  including the availability of suitable acquisition candidates  financial resources and skilled employees to manage the acquired companies  the negotiation of acceptable terms  and general economic and business conditions 
the likelihood of our success in establishing start up operations also depends on similar factors  including identification of suitable start up markets  availability of financial resources and skilled employees and subcontractors  and general economic and business conditions 
in addition  start up operations may require significant lead time before they generate sufficient revenues to be profitable 
expansion through acquisitions or start up operations will require substantial attention from our management team 
the diversion of management s attention  the incurrence of substantial indebtedness to finance the expansion  as well as difficulties that may be encountered in the transition and integration process  could have a material adverse effect on our operations or business 
our new product offerings may not be attractive to customers 
we continue to introduce new home designs and new community concepts as part of our product offerings 
there are significant risks that we may not accurately predict the tastes or preferences of potential home buyers 
a failure to predict these tastes or preferences could have a material adverse effect on our sales 
the loss of certain key personnel could adversely effect our operations 
we have several key executive officers  the loss or prolonged absence of whom could have an adverse effect on our operations 
in particular  the loss of the services or prolonged absence of douglas borror  our chairman  chief executive officer and president could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
our future success will depend on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel  of which there can be no assurance 
our operating results vary on a quarterly basis 
our business is significantly affected by changes in economic cycles  and our revenues and earnings vary with the level of general economic activity in the markets where we build homes 
we historically have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  variability in revenues and reported earnings on a quarterly basis 
a significant percentage of our sales contracts historically have been executed during the first half of the year 
closing on a home usually occurs approximately three to six months after the date of the sales contract  however weather and other delays  may cause the closing to take longer 
we do not recognize any revenue on the sale of a home until the closing occurs 
as a result  we historically have experienced higher closings and revenues during the second half of the year 

table of contents we are subject to warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business that could be costly 
as a homebuilder  we are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business 
these claims are common in the homebuilding industry and can be costly 
we provide warranties on our homes for periods as long as thirty years 
in the event that we experience greater warranty claims than we anticipate  we could incur significant expenses which could affect future earnings 
litigation related to construction defects could adversely affect our business 
litigation related to construction defects has increased significantly in recent years 
the homebuilding industry has experienced both an increase in the number of individual claims for construction defects as well as increased costs of insuring against such claims 
our financial results are subject to inflation and other cost increases 
we are not always able to reflect all cost increases in the prices of our homes because competitive pressures and other factors sometimes require us to maintain or discount those prices 
while we attempt to maintain costs with subcontractors from the date a sales contract with a customer is accepted until the date construction is completed  we may incur unanticipated costs which cannot be passed on to the customer 
material or labor shortages can adversely affect our business 
during periods of increased construction activity  the homebuilding industry has faced shortages in the availability of skilled labor 
waiting for skilled labor to become available may result in construction delays 
the use of less skilled labor to satisfy a skilled labor shortage may cause quality standards to suffer 
increases in the demand for skilled labor also can result in increases in the cost of skilled labor 
the principal raw materials used in the homebuilding industry are lumber  brick and concrete as well as plumbing and electrical supplies 
while these materials are generally available from a variety of sources  they are subject to periodic price fluctuations 
in particular  the homebuilding industry has experienced occasional lumber shortages which produced significant price increases 
because we may not be able to pass on to our customers price increases in raw materials or labor  future price increases in these items could have a material adverse effect on our operating margins and earnings 
the homebuilding industry is highly competitive 
we compete in each of our geographic markets with national  regional and local homebuilders  some of which have greater financial  marketing  land acquisition and sales resources than we do 
we compete not only for home buyers  but also for desirable properties  financing  raw materials and skilled labor 
competitive conditions may make it difficult for us to acquire land that is suitable for our development  cause us to lower our prices and cause our sales to decline 
we also compete with the resale market for existing homes  which some home buyers may prefer over new homes 
additionally  there are many other national and regional homebuilders  many of which have greater financial  marketing  land acquisition and sales resources than we do  that do not currently have a significant presence in our markets 
a concerted effort by these homebuilders to enter or expand their current operations in our markets could have a material adverse effect on our sales 

table of contents covenants in our bank credit facility restrict our ability to engage in certain activities 
our bank credit facility imposes restrictions on our operations and activities 
some of the more significant restrictions limit the amount we may borrow under the bank credit facility based upon borrowing base limitations  maintenance of interest coverage  net worth and leverage ratios  the amount of our uncommitted land holdings and unzoned land purchases  the amount that we may borrow outside of the bank credit facility and the amount of contingent obligations that we can assume  the amount we may invest in homebuilding operations in markets other than central ohio or kentucky  speculative and model home inventory  leases  and the payment of dividends 
application of critical accounting policies requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that may impact our future financial results 
in preparing our financial statements  management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the annual and quarterly reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities 
our actual results could be different from these estimates and assumptions 
some of our more critical accounting policies include reserves to reduce our real estate inventories to net realizable values  estimates for construction costs for homes closed  reserves for the estimated warranty cost of homes  estimates of the costs to complete land development  estimates of the annualized capitalization rate for indirect overhead  interest and other expenses  estimates of self insured worker s compensation and medical claims  and estimates of the annual effective tax rate in interim periods 
seasonality and variability in quarterly results we experience significant seasonality and quarter to quarter variability in our homebuilding activity 
historically  closings and related revenues usually increase in the second half of the year 
we believe this seasonality reflects the tendency of home buyers to shop for a new home in the spring with the goal of closing in the fall or winter 
weather conditions can also accelerate or delay the scheduling of closings 
during  however  the historical trend of closing more homes in the second half of the year was not as evident due to the lower sales experienced during the last nine months of the year

table of contents we include a home in sales contracts when a home buyer signs our standard sales contract  which requires a deposit and generally has no contingencies other than for buyer financing or for the sale of an existing home  or both 
we recognize revenue and cost of real estate sold at the time of closing 
closings or deliveries occur when we deliver the deed to the home buyer and we receive payment for the home 
we include a home in backlog when a home buyer signs our standard sales contract  but the closing has not occurred as of the end of the period 
homes included in sales contracts in the foregoing table are net of cancellations 
most cancellations occur when home buyers cannot qualify for financing 
while most cancellations occur prior to the start of construction  some cancellations occur during the construction process 
the cancellation rates for homes in backlog as of december    and were   and  respectively 
we annually incur a substantial amount of indirect construction costs  which are essentially fixed in nature 
for purposes of quarterly financial reporting  we capitalize these indirect construction costs in real estate inventories based on the ratio of estimated annual indirect construction costs to direct construction costs to be incurred 
thus  variations in construction activity may result in changes in the amount of indirect construction costs capitalized in ending real estate inventories and cause fluctuations in interim and annual gross profits 
compared to revenues 
our revenues for decreased by to million from the delivery of  homes compared to revenues for of million from the delivery of  homes 
during  the average delivered price of homes increased to  from  for and partially offset the loss in revenues caused by delivering fewer homes 
the higher average price of delivered homes in occurred across all series of homes  but was more weighted toward our higher priced homes 
revenues for include million from the sale of homes that we leased back for use as sales models 
there were no model homes sold and leased back during included in revenues are other revenues  consisting principally of fees from the company s mortgage financing services subsidiary 
during  these other revenues decreased to million from million for primarily because we only provided mortgage financing services to approximately  or approximately  of our home buyers during compared to approximately  or approximately  of our home buyers during gross profit 
our gross profit for decreased by to million from million for  primarily due to the fewer number of homes delivered  the reduction in mortgage financing services income as discussed above and the higher costs of real estate compared to in addition  we charged to earnings approximately million primarily consisting of deposits and due diligence expenses on land we decided not to purchase 
warranty expense that is accounted for as part of our building cost decreased by million over due to better warranty claim experience during than was provided for based upon historical claims

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for increased by to million from million for the primary reasons for the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for were additional expenses that were incurred in connection with the increase in the number of our communities in central ohio and louisville  kentucky  the start up of our lexington  kentucky market  the testing and documentation of internal controls required by the sarbanes oxley act and the replacement of key personnel 
interest expense 
our interest expense for increased by to million from million for due to having higher average borrowings outstanding  partially offset by a lower average borrowing rate and capitalized interest 
during  we paid million of interest compared to million of interest during  a increase 
our average revolving line of credit borrowings outstanding increased to million for compared to million for due to increased investment in land and land development

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for increased by to million from million for the primary reasons for the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for were higher variable costs associated with delivering more homes 
these higher variable costs included variable incentive compensation  sales commissions  advertising expenses and administrative expenses related to the mortgage financing services subsidiary

our income tax expense for increased to million from million for the company s annual effective tax rate decreased to for  from for due to implementation of various tax planning strategies 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our capital needs have depended on sales volume  asset turnover  land acquisition and inventory levels 
our traditional sources of capital have been internally generated cash  bank borrowings and seller financing 
at times  we also have sold our common shares in the public market 
we have incurred indebtedness in the past and expect to incur indebtedness in the future to fund our operations and our investment in land 
we expect the cash flow from our sales in backlog and funds from our senior unsecured revolving credit facility to allow us to meet our short term cash obligations 
the primary reasons that we could require additional capital are an expansion in our existing markets  expansion into new markets  expansion of our mortgage financing services subsidiary  or a purchase of a homebuilding company 
see business risks our business is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in national and local economic  business and other conditions  most of which are beyond our control contained in item of this report 
we believe that our current borrowing capacity and anticipated cash flows from operations should be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs during sources and uses of cash for the three year period ended december  during  we generated million of cash flow from operations before expenditures on real estate inventories 
real estate inventories utilized million of net cash because our investment in land and land development and other costs increased by million as we added additional communities and increased our land inventories 
we had fewer homes under construction during compared to  which offset the increase in land inventories by million 
we used cash from operations together with approximately million of net additional borrowings under our bank credit facility  primarily to finance the increase in real estate inventories 

table of contents during  we generated million of cash flow from operations before expenditures on real estate inventories 
our real estate inventories increased by million because homes under construction increased by million and land and land development and other costs increased by million 
we invested significantly in land and land development in order to replace communities that had sold out earlier than anticipated  to expand our presence in louisville  kentucky and to enter the lexington  kentucky market 
we used cash from operations together with borrowings under our bank credit facility to finance the increase in real estate inventories 
during  we generated million of cash flow from operations before expenditures on real estate inventories 
we also raised approximately million in cash from the sale of  common shares  and we used this cash to reduce debt under our bank credit facility 
our real estate inventories increased by million because homes under construction increased by million and land and land development and other costs increased by million 
we used cash from operations together with borrowings under our bank credit facility to finance the increase in real estate inventories 
real estate inventories our real estate inventories at december  increased million to million compared to million at december  real estate inventories include land and land development costs  homes under construction  land held for sale and other building materials 
as of december   land and land development costs increased to million from million as of december   homes under construction decreased to million from million on december  and other building material inventories decreased to million from million as of december  at december   land held for sale was million 
no land was held for sale at december  our land and land development costs increased principally due to the increased number of sales communities 
we generally do not purchase land for resale 
however  there are times when we own land that no longer fits into our development plans and that we offer for sale  primarily to other homebuilders and commercial developers 
we attempt to maintain a land inventory that is sufficient to meet our anticipated lot needs for the next three to six years 
at december   we owned lots or land that we estimate could be developed into  lots  including  lots in kentucky 
included in the  lots are lots that we have determined no longer fit into our sales plans and that we are offering for sale to other home builders or commercial developers 
at december   we controlled  through option agreements or contingent contracts  land that we estimate could be developed into  additional lots  including lots in kentucky 
we hold additional contingent agreements for land that may allow us to develop additional lots that are not included in these totals 
however  based on our land review process  we have concluded that it is unlikely that all of the contingencies contained in these other agreements will be satisfied in the near future 
consequently  we did not consider these contingent agreements when estimating the total amount of land or number of lots that we 
table of contents control 
the option agreements that we determined were more than likely to have the contingencies satisfied expire at various dates through during  we exercised options to purchase lots or unimproved land that could be developed into  lots  including  lots in kentucky 
we decide whether to exercise any particular option or otherwise acquire additional land based upon our assessment of a number of factors  including our existing land inventory at the time  the status of purchase contingencies and our evaluation of the future demand for our homes 
on december   we had single family inventory homes  including in kentucky  in various stages of construction  representing an aggregate investment of million  compared to single family inventory homes  including in louisville  kentucky  in various stages of construction  representing an aggregate investment of million on december  we do not include inventory homes in sales or backlog 
contractual obligations note payable  banks 
on december   we entered into a second amended and restated million senior unsecured revolving credit facility the facility that terminates on may  on june   the facility was amended to increase the amount of the facility to million from million 
on february   the facility was amended to increase the value of speculative inventory homes allowed from million to million for the period from december  through june  as of december   we were in compliance with the facility covenants and had million available under the facility  after adjustment for borrowing base limitations 
borrowing availability under the facility could increase  depending on our use of the proceeds of borrowings under the facility 
the facility provides for a variable rate of interest on our borrowings 
the variable rate is the three month libor rate plus a margin based on our interest coverage ratio that ranges from to and is determined quarterly 
the margin was during all quarters in in order to reduce the risks caused by interest rate fluctuations  we have entered into interest rate swap contracts that fix the interest rate on a portion of our borrowings under the facility 
the weighted average interest rates for borrowings under the facility for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
these rates include the cost of our interest rate swaps 
interest rates for decreased compared to due to a lower average borrowing rate resulting from a lower interest rate environment 
additional information regarding the interest rate swap contracts we have entered into is set forth under the heading quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item a of this report 
for a more detailed description of the facility  including restrictions on our business activities  see note  note payable  banks in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
seller financing 
from time to time  we purchase land with seller financing 
as of december   we held land for development that was partially financed with seller provided term debt that had an outstanding balance of approximately million 

table of contents capital and operating leases 
we believe the best use of our facility is to finance real estate inventories and other investments in our homebuilding operations 
other assets that support our homebuilding operations are generally financed through capital and operating lease obligations 
these assets include office facilities  model homes  vehicles and equipment 
we analyze each lease and determine whether the lease is a capital lease  in which case the asset and related obligation is included on our consolidated balance sheet  or an operating lease  in which case the asset and obligation is not included on our consolidated balance sheet 
we do not retain a residual financial interest in leased assets 
our capital lease obligations were approximately  at december  we believe our operating leases are properly classified as off balance sheet transactions 
our minimum rental commitment under such non cancelable operating leases was approximately million at december  for further information on our leases  see note  operating lease commitments  and note  related party transactions  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
land purchase commitments 
on december   we had non cancelable obligations to purchase residential lots and unimproved land at an aggregate cost of  we intend to purchase this land over the next year 
the following is a summary of our contractual obligations at december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years after years term obligations note payable  banks term debt capital lease obligations operating leases land purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations off balance sheet arrangements performance bonds and irrevocable letters of credit 
we are liable for performance bonds of million and irrevocable letters of credit of million at december  these instruments were issued to municipalities and other individuals to ensure performance and completion of certain land development activities and as collateral for contingent land purchase commitments 
we do not anticipate incurring any liability with respect to these instruments 
variable interest entities 
from time to time  we selectively enter into joint ventures with other homebuilders to own and develop communities 
through the creation of joint venture partnerships and limited liability companies  these joint ventures engage in land development activities for the purpose of distributing developed lots to the partners in the entity 
the partners in the joint ventures acquire substantially all of the lots developed by the joint ventures and fund the development costs in proportion to their equity interests 
we receive our percentage interest in the lots developed in the form of capital distributions 
at december   we had ownership interests in nine active joint ventures with ownership interests ranging from to 
table of contents 
these joint ventures generally do not hold debt securities  except for seller requested financing arrangements upon purchasing the land for the joint ventures 
in certain cases  we may be liable under debt commitments within the particular joint venture 
as of december   we were party to one joint venture that finances its own development activities 
we have guaranteed the obligations under the joint venture s loan agreement up to  representing our one half interest 
at december   the joint venture did not have any loans outstanding 
we have determined that our land development joint ventures do not qualify as variable interest entities that would require consolidation in our financial statements 
see note  land development joint ventures  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
in managing our land inventories  we enter into land option and contingent purchase contracts with third parties to acquire unimproved land and developed lots  which may qualify as variable interest entities 
these contracts may be with individual land owners or entities that hold land for sale and generally require us to pay or issue one or a combination of the following refundable deposits  non refundable deposits and letters of credit 
we have determined that certain of these contracts are with variable interest entities and that we are the primary beneficiary  as defined in fin r  of approximately million of land option contracts or contingent purchase contracts 
these contracts were consolidated in our consolidated balance sheet at december  even though we do not have legal title to the land subject to these contracts 
of the million  approximately million relates to cancelable contracts for which the company has determined that it is reasonably likely that it will complete the land or lot purchase 
the remaining approximately million relates to cancelable contractual obligations for which the company has not yet determined whether it is reasonably likely that it will complete the land or lot purchase 
our exposure to loss is limited to option deposits  letters of credit and due diligence expenses  which were approximately million at december  cancelable contractual obligations consist of options under which we have the right  but not the obligation  to purchase land and contingent purchase contracts under which our obligation to purchase land is subject to the satisfaction of zoning  utility  environmental  title or other contingencies 
we continually evaluate our cancelable contractual obligations to purchase unimproved land and developed lots 
at december   we had approximately million of cancelable contractual obligations for which we had determined it is reasonably likely that we will complete the land or lot purchase 
our good faith deposits and related due diligence costs on these contracts were approximately million at december  in addition  approximately million of performance bonds and irrevocable letters of credit were outstanding as collateral for these contingent land purchase commitments at december  assuming that the contingencies are satisfied and that no other significant obstacles to development arise  we expect to purchase most of the residential lots and unimproved land that are subject to these cancelable contractual obligations within the next several years 
we expect to fund our land acquisition and development obligations from internally generated cash and from the borrowing capacity under the facility 
we are in the process of evaluating approximately million of additional cancelable contractual obligations for which we have not yet determined whether it is reasonably likely that we will complete the land or lot purchase 
at december   good faith deposits and related due diligence costs on these contracts were approximately million 
good faith deposits and related due diligence costs are charged to earnings when we determine the purchase of the land or lots will not be completed 

table of contents we own a interest in a consolidated title insurance agency  alliance title agency  ltd  that provides closing services for our central ohio homes 
at december   our investment in the title insurance agency was approximately  we determined that the title insurance agency is a variable interest entity and consolidated it with our other homebuilding operations effective january  in  we entered into an agreement with an unaffiliated third party to sell and lease back certain homes for use as sales models 
this agreement was amended on september   at which time homes were sold and leased back for use as sales models 
at december   we had homes subject to a one year lease which expires in september but which the company  at its option  may continue on a month to month basis and five model homes subject to a month to month lease under this agreement 
we have determined that these leases are not with a variable interest entity and rental obligations are properly classified as operating leases in our schedule of contractual obligations 
brc is the owner of two office buildings that we lease under long term leases 
we have no residual financial interest in these properties 
we analyzed these leases with brc and determined that brc was not a variable interest entity requiring consolidation in our financial statements 
the following is a summary of our commercial commitments under off balance sheet arrangements at december  in thousands amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts committed less than year years years after years other commercial commitments letters of credit performance bonds guarantees cancelable land contracts total commercial commitments inflation and other cost increases we are not always able to reflect all of our cost increases in the prices of our homes because competitive pressures and other factors sometimes require us to maintain or discount those prices 
while we attempt to maintain material  labor and subcontractor costs from the date a sales contract with a customer is accepted until the date construction is completed  we may incur unanticipated costs which cannot be passed on to the customer 
for example  delays in construction of a home can cause the mortgage commitment to expire and can require us  if mortgage interest rates have increased  to pay significant amounts to the mortgage lender to extend the original mortgage interest rate 
in addition  during periods of high construction activities  we may incur additional costs to obtain subcontractors when certain trades are not readily available  which additional costs can result in lower gross profits 
periods of rapid price increases can result in lower gross profits 

table of contents recently issued accounting pronouncement in december  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued fasb statement no 
r fas r  share based payment  which requires companies to expense the value of employee stock options and other similar awards 
fas r will be effective beginning july  we are currently reviewing the adoption and valuation methods available under fas r 
we do not expect its adoption to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies the foregoing management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  including the related notes  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to real estate inventories  warranty obligations  and construction costs for homes closed 
we base these estimates on historical trends and experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements reserves to reduce our real estate inventories to net realizable value are recorded using several factors  including management s plans for future operations  recent operating results and projected cash flows 
these projected cash flows reflect assumptions related to expected future demand and market conditions 
the adequacy of our reserves could be materially affected by changes in market conditions 
estimates for construction costs for homes closed are recorded in the period when the related home is closed 
these estimates are based on detailed budgets for each home and historical experience and trends 
if actual costs change  significant variances may be encountered 
reserves for the estimated cost of homes under warranty are recorded in the period in which the related home is closed and are based on historical experience and trends in actual warranty costs 
should actual warranty experience change  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
estimates for the costs to complete land development are recorded upon completion of the related land development project 
estimates for land and land development costs are allocated to development phases based on the total number of lots expected to be developed within each community and are based on detailed budgets for the land development project and historical experience and trends 
if actual costs or the total number of lots developed changes  significant variances may be encountered 

table of contents estimates for capitalized overhead and interest costs are recorded in real estate inventories for interim financial reporting purposes 
annualized capitalization rates for indirect overhead and interest are determined by estimating the total current year projected development costs  indirect construction costs  interest  closings and ending inventory 
if actual costs  closings or inventory levels change  significant variances to quarterly results may be encountered 
self insurance accruals are made for certain claims associated with workers compensation and medical benefits 
these accruals include estimates that are based on assumptions about historical loss development factors and actual benefit costs 
differences in estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual requirement materially different from the calculated amounts 
we record income tax liabilities utilizing known obligations and estimates of potential obligations 
a deferred tax asset or liability is recognized whenever there are future tax effects from existing temporary differences and tax credit carryforwards 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the balance that is more likely than not to be realized 
we use an estimate of the annual effective tax rate at each interim period based on the facts and circumstances available at that time  while the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year end 
if circumstances change  our estimated annual effective tax rate could change  creating variances in quarterly results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we were a party to twelve interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million  as reflected in the table below 
we enter into swap contracts to minimize earnings fluctuations caused by interest rate volatility associated with our variable rate debt 
the swap contracts allow us to have variable rate borrowings and to select the level of fixed rate debt for the company as a whole 
under the swap contracts  we agree with other parties to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed rate and floating rate amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional amount 
our current intention is to maintain a range of to of our debt at a fixed interest rate 
however  market conditions and timing effect the company s ability to maintain this balance between fixed and variable interest rates 
therefore  at any time  this percentage may be more or less depending on specific circumstances 
at december  our level of fixed rate debt under the facility  after considering the effect of the interest rate swaps  was 
however  million of interest rate swaps were scheduled to mature in january and our outstanding borrowings are expected to increase in early  primarily due to the purchase and development of land 
the combination of these two events is expected to bring our level of fixed rate debt back into the range we desire to maintain on a long term basis 
we do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes
