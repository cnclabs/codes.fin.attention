micrel designs  develops  manufactures and markets a range of high performance analog power ics  mixed signal and digital ics 
these circuits are used in a wide variety of electronics products  including those in the computer  telecommunications  industrial and networking markets 
in addition to standard products  the company manufactures custom analog and mixed signal circuits and provides wafer foundry services 
following the most severe downturn in the history of the semiconductor industry in  customer demand for the company s products remained weak in as customers reacted to slow economic growth and high inventory levels of semiconductor components throughout the supply chain 
lead times for semiconductor components were short resulting in poor visibility into future customer demand 
the company s gross profit and net income declined in due to lower unit volume  declining selling prices for the company s products and an increased level of unabsorbed fixed costs due to lower utilization levels of the company s wafer fabrication lines 
in response to this environment of uncertain demand the company focused on reducing costs 
the company s objective was to align its cost structure with the reduced revenue levels while retaining sufficient manufacturing capacity  and sustaining a level of research and development investment that should facilitate future growth 
in addition to reducing discretionary spending and payroll costs  the company sought to significantly reduce its manufacturing costs 
one of the company s most significant cost reduction actions was the consolidation of its santa clara  california wafer fabrication operation into its san jose  california wafer fabrication facility 
this action commenced in and was completed in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
by the end of  the company s manufacturing cost reduction efforts had offset a substantial portion of the erosion in gross profit resulting from the decline in average selling prices 
the company continued to invest in research and development at a rate in excess of of revenues management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued while selling  general and administrative spending was reduced to a level in which approached spending 
in the company returned to profitability after recording a loss on an annual basis for the first time in its history in the first half of was characterized by the continuation of limited visibility into  and uncertainty of  customer demand 
the uncertainty of demand was compounded in the first half of by events such as the war in iraq and the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in asia sars 
the company s quarterly revenues remained relatively flat  averaging million per quarter for the first half of the company recorded a small net loss for this period 
in the second half of  customer demand increased as the united states and asian economies began to grow more rapidly 
the company s new order rates  or bookings  grew faster than revenue in the third and fourth quarter of  resulting in sequential growth in both revenues and order backlog 
the growth in new orders and revenues in the second half of was driven by demand for the company s standard products from customers serving the communications  computing  industrial and wireless handset end markets 
gross margins and net income increased in the second half of the company continued to generate positive cash flows from operations on a quarterly basis throughout the company s financial results continued to improve in revenues grew to the highest level since  increasing percent over the strength in customer order rates that began in the second half of continued through most of the first half of the increase in customer demand caused lead times for semiconductor components  including micrel s  to expand during the first and second quarters of as customers and distributors became concerned about availability of supply 
the company s revenues continued to grow in the first half of the year and gross margin  operating margin and net income increased on a sequential basis in both the first and second quarters 
by the end of the second quarter  customers began to perceive that the supply of semiconductor components was generally sufficient and lead times for certain components began to shrink 
in the third and fourth quarter of  demand was below normal seasonal levels as customers reacted quickly to uncertain demand for their products  decreasing semiconductor lead times and uncertain economic conditions by reducing their order rates 
because of the lessons learned from the painful excess inventory situation that occurred in  the company s customers appear to be more sensitive to change in end demand for their products and supplier lead times 
customers in certain end markets such as networking  enterprise computing and high speed communications experienced lower demand for their end products than they had anticipated 
this factor  combined with rapidly shrinking lead times from most semiconductor suppliers  led to lower order rates for the company s products in the second half of as customers attempted to control their inventory levels 
semiconductor distributors also reacted to decreasing lead times by reducing order rates 
inventories at the company s distributors  after increasing during the first half of  declined throughout the second half of the year and ending levels were slightly higher than ending inventories 
inventory levels at the company s stocking representatives  after growing significantly during the first nine months of  remained flat during the fourth quarter of and ended with levels significantly higher than ending inventories 
the proportion of the company s total sales to china  taiwan and southeast asia  which are primarily served by stocking representatives  continued to grow in due to the continued shift in electronics manufacturing to china and southeast asia from north america and europe 
the company s level of on hand inventory remained above prior year levels to provide a high level of customer service in response to shorter customer lead times 
as a result of lower order rates  the company s backlog and revenues declined in both the third and fourth quarter of at the end of  lead times for the company s products remained low  at approximately two to three weeks  and visibility into customer demand was poor 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued despite reduced revenues in the second half of the company s gross margin declined only slightly and operating margins remained above in both the third and fourth quarter 
for the year  gross margin improved by over to  operating margin increased to in from in  and the company s net income per diluted share increased substantially to in from in included in net income for were million in reversals of income and payroll tax liabilities associated with the conclusion of a tax audit see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company generated the second highest level of operating cash flow in the company s history in and repaid almost all of its outstanding debt during the year 
operating cash flow less cash used for the purchase of property  plant and equipment commonly referred to as free cash flow was the highest in the company s history 
in  micrel completed the acquisition of bluechip communications as bluechip of oslo  norway 
bluechip is a fabless semiconductor company that designs  develops and markets high performance rf ics and modules for the actuation and connectivity markets 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase under sfas business combinations and  accordingly  the results of operations of bluechip from the date of acquisition forward have been included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company derives a substantial portion of its net revenues from standard products 
for  and the company s standard products sales accounted for   and  respectively  of the company s net revenues 
the company believes that a substantial portion of its net revenues in the future will depend upon standard products sales  although such sales as a proportion of net revenues may vary as the company adjusts product output levels to correspond with varying economic conditions and demand levels in the markets which it serves 
the standard products business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules  and customer orders typically can be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
since most standard products backlog is cancelable without significant penalty  the company typically plans its production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
in addition  the company is limited in its ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
the company may experience significant fluctuations in its results of operations 
factors that affect the company s results of operations include the volume and timing of orders received  changes in the mix of products sold  the utilization level of manufacturing capacity  competitive pricing pressures and the successful development of new products 
these and other factors are described in further detail later in this discussion 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis  which could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates the financial statements included in this form k and discussed within this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
for a detailed discussion of the company s significant accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company considers certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  income taxes  and litigation to be critical to the fair presentation of its financial statements 
revenue recognition and receivables 
micrel generates revenue by selling products to original equipment manufacturers oem s  distributors and stocking representatives 
stocking representative firms may buy and stock the company s products for resale or may act as the company s sales representative in arranging for direct sales from the company to an oem customer 
the company s policy is to recognize revenue from sales to customers when the rights and risks of ownership have passed to the customer  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
micrel allows certain distributors  primarily located in north america and europe  and in certain countries in asia  significant return rights  price protection and pricing adjustments subsequent to the initial product shipment 
as these returns and price concessions have historically been significant  and future returns and price concessions are difficult to reliably estimate  the company defers recognition of revenue and related cost of sales in the balance sheet line item deferred income on shipments to distributors derived from sales to these distributors until they have resold the company s products to their customers 
although revenue recognition and related cost of sales are deferred  the company records an accounts receivable and relieves inventory at the time of initial product shipment 
as standard terms are fob shipping point  payment terms are enforced from shipment date and legal title and risk of inventory loss passes to the distributor upon shipment 
in addition  the company may offer to its distributors  where revenue is deferred upon shipment and recognized on a sell through basis  price adjustments to allow the distributor to price the company s products competitively for specific resale opportunities 
the company estimates and records an allowance for distributor price adjustments for which the specific resale transaction has been completed  but the price adjustment claim has not yet been received and recorded by the company 
sales to oem customers and asian based stocking representatives are recognized upon shipment 
the company does not grant return rights  price protection or pricing adjustments to oem customers 
the company offers limited contractual stock rotation rights to stocking representatives 
in addition  the company is not contractually obligated to offer  but may infrequently grant  price adjustments or price protection to certain stocking representatives on an exception basis 
at the time of shipment to oems and stocking representatives  an allowance for returns and price adjustments is established based upon historical return rates 
actual future returns and price adjustments could be different than the allowance established 
the company also maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable 
this estimate is based on an analysis of specific customer creditworthiness and historical bad debts experience 
actual future uncollectible amounts could exceed the doubtful accounts allowance established 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
the company records adjustments to write down the cost of obsolete and excess inventory to the estimated market value based on historical and forecasted demand for its products 
if actual future demand for the company s products is less than currently forecasted  additional inventory adjustments may be required 
once a reserve is established  it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or otherwise disposed of 
this treatment is in accordance with accounting research bulletin and sec staff accounting bulletin restructuring and impairment charges 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities result primarily from temporary timing differences between book and tax valuation of assets and liabilities  state and federal research and development credit carryforwards and state manufacturers credit carryforwards 
the company must assess the likelihood that future taxable income levels will be sufficient to ultimately realize the tax benefits of these deferred tax assets 
as of december   the company believes that future taxable income levels will be sufficient to realize the tax benefits of these deferred tax assets and has not established a valuation allowance 
should the company determine that future realization of these tax benefits is not likely  a valuation allowance would be established  which would increase the company s tax provision in the period of such determination 
in addition  the calculation of the company s tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
the company records liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on its estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes may be due 
actual tax liabilities may be different than the recorded estimates and could result in an additional charge or benefit to the tax provision in the period when the ultimate tax assessment is determined 
during the second quarter of  the company reversed million of accrued income tax liabilities as a result of the completion of a federal income tax audit 
in addition  related to the federal tax audit completion  the company also reversed million in accrued payroll tax liabilities 
this reduction in accrued payroll tax liabilities has been recorded as a million reduction in cost of revenues  a million reduction in research and development expense and a million reduction in selling  general and administrative expense in the second quarter of see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
litigation 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
the company is currently involved in such intellectual property litigation see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and has not accrued a liability for such litigation 
the company regularly evaluates current information available to determine whether such accruals should be made 
an estimated liability would be accrued when it is determined to be probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
if the company were to determine that such a liability was probable and could be reasonable estimated  the adjustment would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of total net revenues for the periods indicated 
years ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of deferred stock compensation manufacturing facility impairment restructuring expense acquisition expenses total operating expenses income loss from operations other income  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income net revenues 
net revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million in primarily due to increased standard product revenues  which were partially offset by decreased custom and foundry revenues 
standard product revenues increased to million  which represented of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million and of net revenues for these increases resulted primarily from increased unit shipments of standard products to the telecommunications  computer  industrial  high speed communications and networking end markets 
custom and foundry revenues decreased to million  which represented of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million and of net revenues for such decreases were due primarily to decreased unit shipments of foundry products principally due to the cessation of manufacturing for a single customer  lexmark  at the end of customer demand for semiconductors can change quickly and unexpectedly 
from the middle of through  customers perceived that semiconductor components were readily available and ordered only for their short term needs  resulting in historically low order backlog levels 
the company s revenue levels have been highly dependent on the amount of new orders that are received for which product is requested to be delivered to the customer within the same quarter 
within the semiconductor industry these orders that are booked and shipped within the quarter are called turns fill orders 
when the turns fill level exceeds approximately of quarterly revenue  it makes management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued it very difficult to predict near term revenues and income 
because of the long cycle time to build its products  the company s lack of visibility into demand when turns fill is high makes it difficult to predict what product to build to match future demand 
the company averaged approximately turns fill per quarter during as lead times and backlog increased during the first half of the turns fill requirement declined to by the second quarter 
after experiencing an increase in order rates and backlog in the first six months of  order rates in the second half declined as customers quickly reduced new orders in an attempt to control their inventories in response to uncertain demand for their end products and declining supplier lead times 
the company s lead times decreased during the fourth quarter to less than four weeks at the end of december  compared with average lead times of seven to eight weeks during the first half of this resulted in an increased turns fill requirement in the fourth quarter to approximately 
although overall semiconductor industry channel inventories appear to be equal to or below long term historical trends  customers perceive semiconductor components are readily available 
customers are cautious in committing new orders  relying instead on short lead times and the willingness of semiconductor manufacturers to hold inventory and react quickly to supply their short term needs 
the slowing of global economic growth rates  the aversion to holding inventory and the hope of negotiating lower prices has caused many customers to reduce order backlog on their suppliers 
the company s backlog at december  declined on a sequential basis and was below the backlog level of december  the lower backlog level  increased reliance on turns fill orders  unseasonable weakness in order rates and the uncertain growth rate of the world economy make it difficult to predict near term demand 
although the company has reduced production levels in response to lower order rates  the uncertainty in demand arising from these factors  together with the uncertainty of product mix and pricing  make it difficult to predict future levels of sales and profitability and may require the company to continue to carry higher levels of inventory 
for the year ended december   net revenues increased to from million in primarily due to increased standard product revenues  which were partially offset by decreased custom and foundry revenues 
standard product revenues increased to million  which represented of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million and of net revenues for this increase resulted primarily from increased unit shipments of industrial  telecommunications  computer and communications products  which was partially offset by decreased average selling prices across all significant standard product lines 
custom and foundry revenues decreased to million  which represented of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million and of net revenues for such decreases were due primarily to decreased unit shipments of foundry products 
international sales represented   and of net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
on a dollar basis  international sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in these increases resulted primarily from increased shipments of telecommunications  networking communications and high speed communications products  primarily in asia and to a lesser extent europe 
the trend for the company s customers to move their electronics manufacturing to asian countries has brought increased pricing pressure for micrel and other semiconductor manufacturers 
asian based manufacturers are typically more concerned about cost and less concerned about the capability of the integrated circuits they purchase 
this can make it more difficult for united states based companies to differentiate themselves except by price 
the increased concentration of electronics procurement and manufacturing in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued asia pacific region has led  and may continue to lead  to continued price pressure for the company s products in the future 
gross profit 
gross profit is affected by a variety of factors including the volume of product sales  product mix  manufacturing capacity utilization  product yields and average selling prices 
the company s gross margin increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in gross margin resulted primarily from a greater sales mix of higher margin products  decreased wafer fabrication costs  and decreased external assembly and test costs 
during the year ended december   the company reduced sales of low margin foundry products and increased sales of higher margin analog and high speed communications standard products as compared to the same periods in in addition  during  the company benefited from decreased wafer fabrication costs resulting from the company s wafer fabrication consolidation project see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and lower costs for external assembly and test manufacturing services 
the company s gross profit margin has also benefited from spreading fixed costs over a higher sales volume 
in addition  gross profit for the year ended december  includes the reversal of million of accrued payroll tax liabilities  recorded in the second quarter of  associated with the conclusion of a tax audit see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of deferred stock compensation as a percent of sales declined to for the year ended december  from for the same period in in response to the decline in order rates during the second half of the year and the uncertainty of end demand  the company reduced its level of production in the fourth quarter of and will reduce production activity further in the first quarter of the company is acting to reduce the effect on gross margin from lower factory utilization by reducing the number of days worked in the quarter and controlling expenses 
should global economic growth remain strong and demand for the company s products rebound  the company has the ability to rapidly increase manufacturing output 
for the year ended december   the company s gross margin increased to from for the year ended december  the increase in gross margin primarily reflected decreased wafer fabrication costs resulting from the company s wafer fabrication consolidation plan  lower costs for external assembly and test manufacturing services and lower amortization of deferred stock compensation costs  which were partially offset by a reduction in average selling prices as compared to the same periods in research and development expenses 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenues represented and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
on a dollar basis  research and development expenses decreased million or to million for the year ended december  from million in this decrease was primarily due to decreased prototype fabrication costs and the reversal of million of accrued payroll tax liabilities in the second quarter of  associated with the conclusion of a tax audit see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that the development and introduction of new products is critical to its future success and expects to continue significant investment in research and development activities in the future 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued for the years ended december  and  research and development represented and of net revenues  respectively 
on a dollar basis  research and development expenses decreased million or to million for the year ended december  from million in the decrease was primarily due to decreased prototype fabrication costs combined with reduced staffing costs and reduced mask costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses represented and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
on a dollar basis  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the increase was principally attributable to increased commissions related to higher revenues  increased staffing costs and profit sharing accruals  increased accounting and auditing fees associated with implementation of the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act and increased outside legal costs which were partially offset by the reversal of million of accrued payroll tax liabilities in the second quarter of  associated with the conclusion of a tax audit see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
for the years ended december  and  selling  general and administrative expenses represented and of net revenues  respectively 
on a dollar basis  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the decrease was principally attributable to decreased outside legal costs combined with decreased advertising expenses 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
the company accounts for stock based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
during the years through december  certain of the company s option pricing practices resulted in stock compensation expense under apb see stock based awards included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the company assumed certain stock options granted to employees of kendin communications in connection with the acquisition of kendin communications in which were compensatory under apb as of december  total unamortized stock compensation was million with a future amortization schedule of  in and  in for the year ended december   total amortization of deferred stock compensation was million compared to million in this decrease resulted from decreased deferred compensation balances 
for the year ended december   total amortization of deferred stock compensation was million compared to million in this decrease resulted primarily from million in accelerated amortization in which resulted from options cancelled pursuant to an employee option exchange program see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

purchased in process technology 
in  micrel acquired of the outstanding common stock and options to purchase common stock of bluechip  in a cash for stock transaction 
micrel paid approximately million in cash and incurred approximately  in direct acquisition costs for the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued outstanding bluechip securities and options 
the fair value of the acquired assets exceeded the purchase price by million 
the company deferred million of this excess amount as potential contingent consideration of million was payable  under the terms of the agreement  if certain revenue and gross profit targets were met by the bluechip operations during calendar year as of december   it was determined that the additional contingent consideration of million  which was initially recorded in the first quarter of  would not be payable as certain revenue and gross profit targets were not achieved by the bluechip operation 
as a result  the additional contingent consideration was reversed in the fourth quarter of and the purchase cost allocation was adjusted accordingly see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the purchase cost allocation  as adjusted for the final determination of the contingent consideration  resulted in million of the purchase cost allocated to intangible assets 
of that amount   was expensed during the year ended december  to purchased in process technology  which had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future 
the remaining intangible assets of million  consisting of million in existing technology and  in customer relationships  are included in intangible assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives of three to five years 
manufacturing facility impairment and restructuring expense 
in september  the company approved a plan to close its santa clara  california wafer fabrication facility to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies 
the company accrued million in restructuring expenses associated with the facility closure which consisted of million for equipment disposal costs and million in net contractual building lease costs  excluding estimated sublease income  that will provide no future benefit 
during  the company ceased all manufacturing processes within the santa clara facility and completed the relocation of all employees to its san jose  ca facilities 
during  the company paid million in restructuring costs that reduced the previous restructuring accrual and recorded an additional  in net restructuring accrual adjustments which were charged to restructuring expense in during  the company paid million in restructuring costs that reduced the previous restructuring accrual 
the company also increased its accrued restructuring expenses for contractual building lease costs by  to eliminate remaining estimated future sub lease income as efforts to sub lease the facility have been unsuccessful to date and the estimated probability of future sub lease has been reduced to less than probable 
as of december   the remaining restructuring accrual was million see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
actual future costs may be different than these estimates and would require an adjustment to restructuring expense in the period such determination is made 
also related to the facility closure  in september  the company recorded a million impairment of long lived assets to reduce the net book value of the facility s leasehold improvements and equipment to fair value 
the fair value was based on a third party estimate of the current net sales value 
during  the company sold previously impaired equipment resulting in a  gain which has been recorded as a credit to the manufacturing facility impairment expense 
as of december   there was no remaining book value for equipment previously impaired during the restructuring actions 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued other income  net 
other income  net reflects interest income from investments in short term and long term investment grade securities and money market funds and other non operating income  offset by interest expense incurred on term notes 
other income  net increased by million to million in from  in the increase was primarily due to increased interest income rate of returns on increased cash and investment balances and decreased interest expense resulting from a decrease in average debt as compared to the prior year 
for the year ended december   other income  net decreased by  to  from million in the decrease was primarily due to decreased rates of return on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as compared to the prior year 
in addition  the results included a  expense for the settlement of a patent dispute and a credit of  in other income 
provision benefit for income taxes 
for the year ended december   the provision for income taxes was million or of income before taxes 
the income tax provision for is based on the company s estimated annual statutory tax rate of of pretax income  reduced by a million reversal of accrued income tax liabilities in the second quarter of  as a result of the completion of a federal income tax audit see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the provision for income taxes differs from taxes computed at the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of federal export tax credits  state income taxes and state research and development credits 
for the year ended december   the provision for taxes was of income before taxes 
for the year ended december   the benefit for taxes was of loss before taxes 
the and income tax provision or benefit differ from taxes computed at the federal statutory rate due to the effect of state taxes  state research and development credits and state manufacturing credits 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company s principal sources of funding have been its cash from operations  bank borrowings and sales of common stock 
principal sources of liquidity at december   consisted of cash and short term investments of million and a million revolving line of credit from a commercial bank see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in september  the company borrowed million through a commercial mortgage financing agreement which was associated with the purchase of its previously leased manufacturing facilities in san jose  ca 
borrowings under this agreement bear interest  at the company s election  at the daily floating prime rate  or adjustable monthly libor plus 
the principal balance of the loan is to be repaid in consecutive monthly installments of  and one final installment in the amount necessary to pay in full the remaining outstanding principal balance  with no early payment penalty 
in december  the company repaid million of the loan 
in october  the company repaid the remaining loan balance of million resulting in no balance outstanding at december  associated with the acquisition of bluechip  the company has  outstanding in term notes payable to the norwegian industrial and regional development fund 
the company generated million in cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in compared with was primarily due to a management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued million increase to net income adjusted for non cash activities million net income plus million in non cash activities in compared to a million net income plus million in non cash activities in which was partially offset by a million cash flow decrease due to increased inventory levels in as compared to inventory increase used million in cash flow as compared to cash provided in by a decrease in inventory of million 
for the year ended december   cash flows provided by operating activities of million were primarily attributable to net income after adding back non cash activities of million combined with a million decrease in accounts receivable  a million increase in accounts payable and a million increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors  which were partially offset by a million increase in inventory  a million decrease in other accrued liabilities and a million decrease in income taxes payable 
for the year ended december   cash flows provided by operating activities of million were primarily attributable to net income after adding back non cash activities of million combined with a million decrease in inventory  a million increase in deferred income  a million increase in income taxes payable  which were partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable and million decrease in all other accrued liabilities 
the company s investing activities during the year ended december   used cash of million compared to million used in this increase in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to a million increase in net investment purchases and million used for the purchase of bluechip during  which was partially offset by decreased capital expenditures in cash used for investing activities during the year ended december  of million resulted from net million in net investment purchases  million in purchases of property  plant and equipment  million used for the purchase of bluechip and for the purchase of intangible assets 
the company s investing activities during the year ended december   used cash of million  million less than in this decrease in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to an million facility purchase included in  which was partially offset by increased capital expenditures in cash used for investing activities during the year ended december  of million resulted from net purchases of property  plant and equipment 
the company s financing activities during the year ended december   used cash of million as compared to cash used of million during the year ended december  this increase in cash flow used primarily resulted from an increase in cash used to repurchase shares of the company s common stock 
cash used by financing activities during the year ended december  of million was the result of million used to repurchase  shares of common stock combined with million in repayments of long term debt  which was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock through employee stock transactions of million 
cash used by financing activities during the year ended december  of million was the result of million in repayments of long term debt combined with million to repurchase  shares of common stock  which was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock through employee stock transactions of million 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company currently intends to spend approximately million to million to purchase capital equipment and make facility improvements during the next twelve months primarily for manufacturing equipment for wafer fabrication and product testing and additional research and development related software and equipment 
the company is currently authorized by its board of directors to repurchase an additional million of its common stock through december  since inception  the company s principal sources of funding have been its cash from operations  bank borrowings and sales of common stock 
the company believes that its cash from operations  existing cash balances and short term investments  and its credit facility will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for in the longer term  the company believes future cash requirements will continue to be met by its cash from operations  and future debt or equity financings as required 
recently issued accounting standards please refer to the caption new accounting standards within note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the expected impact of recently issued accounting standards

borrowing agreements consisted of a million revolving line of credit from a commercial bank 
the revolving line of credit agreement includes a provision for the issuance of commercial or standby letters of credit by the bank on behalf of the company 
the value of all letters of credit outstanding reduces the total line of credit available 
there were no borrowings under the revolving line of credit at december  and there were  in standby letters of credit outstanding 
the letters of credit are issued to guarantee payments for the company s workers compensation program 
the company has no other off balance sheet arrangements and has not entered into any transactions involving unconsolidated  limited purpose entities or commodity contracts 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued factors that may affect operating results if a company s operating results are below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  then the market price of its common stock could decline 
many factors that can affect a company s quarterly and annual results are difficult to control or predict 
some of the factors which can affect a multinational semiconductor business such as the company are described below 
geopolitical and macroeconomic risks that may affect multinational enterprises demand for semiconductor components is increasingly dependent upon the rate of growth of the global economy 
if the rate of global economic growth slows  or contracts  customer demand for products could be adversely affected  which in turn could negatively affect revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
many factors could adversely affect regional or global economic growth 
some of the factors that could slow global economic growth include rising interest rates in the united states  increased price inflation for goods  services or materials  a slowdown in the rate of growth of the chinese economy  a significant act of terrorism which disrupts global trade or consumer confidence  geopolitical tensions including war and civil unrest 
reduced levels of economic activity  or disruptions of international transportation  could adversely affect sales on either a global basis or in specific geographic regions the company has generated a substantial portion of its net revenues from export sales 
the company believes that a substantial portion of its future net revenues will depend on export sales to customers in international markets  including asia 
in  of the company s revenues were derived from shipments to customers in asia  up from in and in international markets are subject to a variety of risks  including changes in policy by foreign governments  acts of terrorism  social conditions such as civil unrest  economic conditions including high levels of inflation  fluctuation in the value of foreign currencies and currency exchange rates and trade restrictions or prohibitions 
changes in exchange rates that strengthen the us dollar could increase the price of the company s products in the local currencies of the foreign markets it serves 
this would result in making the company s products relatively more expensive than its competitors products that are denominated in local currencies  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in those foreign markets 
the company has not taken any protective measures against exchange rate fluctuations  such as purchasing hedging instruments 
in addition  the company sells to domestic customers that do business worldwide and cannot predict how the businesses of these customers may be affected by economic or political conditions elsewhere in the world 
such factors could adversely affect the company s future revenues  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the company is reliant on certain key suppliers for wafer fabrication  circuit assembly and testing services 
most of these suppliers are based outside of the us the company s supply could be interrupted as a result of any of the previously mentioned risk factors relating to international markets 
market conditions may lead the company to initiate additional cost reduction plans  which may negatively affect near term operating results 
weak customer demand  competitive pricing pressures  excess capacity  weak economic conditions or other factors  may cause the company to initiate additional actions to reduce the company s cost structure and improve the company s future operating results 
the cost reduction actions may require incremental costs to implement  which could negatively affect the company s operating results in periods when the incremental costs or liabilities are incurred 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued semiconductor industry specific risks the volatility of customer demand in the semiconductor industry limits a company s ability to predict future levels of sales and profitability 
semiconductor suppliers can rapidly increase production output  leading to a sudden oversupply situation and a subsequent reduction in order rates and revenues as customers adjust their inventories to true demand rates 
a rapid and sudden decline in customer demand for products can result in excess quantities of certain products relative to demand 
should this occur the company s operating results may be adversely affected as a result of charges to reduce the carrying value of the company s inventory to the estimated demand level or market price 
the company s quarterly revenues are highly dependent upon turns fill orders orders booked and shipped in the same quarter 
the short term and volatile nature of customer demand makes it extremely difficult to predict near term revenues and profits 
the short lead time environment in the semiconductor industry has allowed many end consumers to rely on stocking representatives and distributors to carry inventory to meet short term requirements and minimize their investment in on hand inventory 
since the end of some of the company s stocking representatives and distributors have increased their inventory levels to service the volatile short term demand of the end customer 
should the relationship with a distributor or stocking representative be terminated  the future level of product returns could be higher than the returns allowance established  which could negatively affect the company s revenues and results of operations 
the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change  price erosion and increased international competition 
significant competitive factors include product features  performance and price  timing of product introductions  emergence of new computer and communications standards  quality and customer support 
during a period when economic growth and customer demand have been less certain  both the semiconductor industry and the company have experienced significant price erosion since the beginning of if price erosion continues  it will have the effect of reducing revenue levels and gross margins in future periods 
furthermore  the trend for the company s customers to move their electronics manufacturing to asian countries has brought increased pricing pressure for micrel and the semiconductor industry 
asian based manufacturers are typically more concerned about cost and less concerned about the capability of the integrated circuits they purchase 
the increased concentration of electronics procurement and manufacturing in the asia pacific region may lead to continued price pressure and additional product advertising costs for the company s products in the future 
an important part of the company s strategy is to continue to focus on the market for high speed communications ics 
if the recovery in the telecommunications infrastructure and wire line networking markets is not sustainable  resulting in reduced demand for the company s high bandwidth products  the company s future revenue growth and profitability could be adversely affected 
the markets that the company serves frequently undergo transitions in which products rapidly incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry wide basis 
if the company s products are unable to support the new features or performance levels required by oems in these markets  it would likely lose business from existing or potential customers and would not have the opportunity to compete for new design wins until the next product transition 
if the company fails to develop products with required features or performance standards  or experiences even a short delay in bringing a new product to market  or if its customers fail to achieve market acceptance of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued their products  its revenues could be significantly reduced for a substantial period of time 
because the standard products market for ics is diverse and highly fragmented  the company encounters different competitors in various market areas 
most of these competitors have substantially greater technical  financial and marketing resources and greater name recognition than the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in either the standard products or custom and foundry products business in the future or that competitive pressures will not adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
the significant investment in semiconductor manufacturing capacity and the rapid growth of circuit design centers in china may present a competitive threat to established semiconductor companies due to the current low cost of labor and capital in china 
the emergence of low cost competitors in china could reduce the revenues and profitability of established semiconductor manufacturers 
many semiconductor companies face risks associated with a dependence upon third parties that manufacture  assemble or package certain of its products 
these risks include reduced control over delivery schedules and quality  inadequate manufacturing yields and excessive costs  the potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand  difficulties selecting and integrating new subcontractors  potential increases in prices  disruption in supply due to civil unrest  terrorism or other events which may occur in the countries in which the subcontractors operate  and potential misappropriation of the company s intellectual property 
any of these risks may lead to increased costs or delay delivery of the company s products  which would harm its profitability and customer relationships 
additionally  the company s wafer and product requirements typically represent a relatively small portion of the total production of the third party foundries and outside assembly  testing and packaging contractors 
as a result  micrel is subject to the risk that a foundry will provide delivery or capacity priority to other larger customers at the expense of micrel  resulting in an inadequate supply to meet customer demand or higher costs to obtain the necessary product supply 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the semiconductor industry  in particular design engineers 
the company may not be able to continue to attract and train engineers or other qualified personnel necessary for the development of its business or to replace engineers or other qualified personnel who may leave its employ in the future 
loss of the services of  or failure to recruit  key design engineers or other technical and management personnel could be significantly detrimental to the company s product and process development programs 
compliance with corporate governance regulations such as the sarbanes oxley act  which requires the company s management to conduct an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting  has increased the company s cost 
compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act and other recent corporate governance and internal control regulations resulted in a tripling of audit and accounting fees in as well as increased costs for internal auditing and third party consultants 
the increased expense in associated with this compliance effort was approximately million  reducing net income per diluted share by approximately 
although the company expects the cost of compliance to decrease in  the cost will remain significantly above years prior to and new regulations  or changes to existing regulations  could cause expenses to be higher than anticipated in the future 
the success of companies in the semiconductor industry depends in part upon intellectual property  including patents  trade secrets  know how and continuing technology innovation 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation or that others will not develop competitive management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued technologies or products 
there can be no assurance that any patent owned by the company will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged  that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages or that any of its pending or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought  if at all 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to the company s technology  duplicate technology or design around the patents owned by the company 
additionally  the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance that existing claims or any other assertions or claims for indemnity resulting from infringement claims will not adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
the recently issued statement of accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment will require the company to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards  in the financial statements 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the ultimate impact from the adoption of this accounting standard is uncertain but it is expected to significantly increase stock based compensation expense in future periods after adoption 
the pro forma effect to net income and earnings per share had the company applied the fair value method to stock based awards has been disclosed in the company s previous form k filings and is contained in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
however  a reduction in net income and earnings per share from the expensing of stock option awards in the company s future results of operation may have an adverse affect on the value of the company s common stock 
if the company reduces the number of stock option grants to employees to minimize the cost associated with share based incentive awards  it will most likely make it more difficult for the company to hire and retain employees 
our customers are requiring that the company offer its products in lead free packages 
governmental regulations in certain countries and our customers intention to produce products that are less harmful to the environment has resulted in a requirement from many of the company s customers to purchase integrated circuits that do not contain lead 
the company has responded by offering its products in lead free versions 
while the lead free versions of the company s products are expected to be more friendly to the environment  the ultimate impact is uncertain 
in addition  the quality  cost and manufacturing yields of the lead free products may be less favorable compared to the products packaged using more traditional materials which may result in higher costs to the company 
companies in the semiconductor industry are subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in its manufacturing process 
any failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in the imposition of fines  the suspension of production  alteration of manufacturing processes or a cessation of operations 
in addition  these regulations could restrict the company s ability to expand its facilities at their present locations or construct or operate a new wafer fabrication facility or could require the company to acquire costly equipment or incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations or clean up prior discharges 
the company s failure to appropriately control the use of  disposal or storage of  or adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances could subject it to future liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on its business 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued company specific risks in addition to the risks that affect multinational semiconductor companies listed above  there are additional risks which are more specific to the company such as the company s gross margin  operating margin and net income are highly dependent on the level of revenue and capacity utilization that the company experiences 
semiconductor manufacturing is a capital intensive business resulting in high fixed costs 
if the company is unable to utilize its installed wafer fabrication or test capacity at a high level  the costs associated with these facilities and equipment would not be fully absorbed  resulting in higher average unit costs and lower profit margins 
the cellular telephone wireless handset market comprises a significant portion of the company s standard product revenues 
the proportion of the company s annual revenues from customers serving the cellular telephone market has been increasing over the last three years  growing from less than of worldwide sales in to approximately in due to the highly competitive and fast changing environment in which the company s cellular telephone customers operate  demand for the product the company sells into this end market can change rapidly and unexpectedly 
if the company s cellular telephone customers lose market share  or accumulate too much inventory of completed handsets  the demand for the company s products can decline sharply which could adversely affect the company s revenues and results of operations 
the company derives a significant portion of its revenues from customers located in certain geographic regions or countries 
three of the company s top ten direct customers are located in south korea 
in the event that political tensions surrounding north korea evolve into military or social conflict  or other factors disrupt the korean economy  the company s revenues  results of operations  cash flow and financial condition could be adversely affected 
a significant portion of the company s revenues come from customers located in taiwan and china 
in the event that economic activity in these two countries declines  or is disrupted by geopolitical events  the company s revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 
the company manufactures most of its semiconductors at its san jose  california fabrication facilities 
the company s existing wafer fabrication facility  located in northern california  may be subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes 
a significant natural disaster  such as an earthquake or prolonged drought  could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
furthermore  manufacturing semiconductors requires manufacturing tools that are unique to each product being produced 
if one of these unique manufacturing tools was damaged or destroyed  the company s ability to manufacture the related product would be impaired and its business would suffer until the tool was repaired or replaced 
additionally  the fabrication of ics is a highly complex and precise process 
small impurities  contaminants in the manufacturing environment  difficulties in the fabrication process  defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer  manufacturing equipment failures  wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to be nonfunctional 
the company maintains approximately two to three months of inventory that has completed the wafer fabrication manufacturing process 
this inventory is generally located offshore at third party subcontractors and can act to buffer some of the adverse impact from a disruption to the company s san jose wafer fabrication activity arising from a natural disaster such as an earthquake 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   the company held million in short term investments and million in long term investments 
short term and long term investments consist primarily of liquid debt instruments and are classified as available for sale securities 
investments purchased with remaining maturity dates of greater than three months and less than months are classified as short term 
investments purchased with remaining maturity dates of months or greater are classified as long term 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at december   the fair value of the short term investments would decline by an immaterial amount 
the company generally expects to have the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity and therefore would not expect operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on short term investments 
at december   the company held an insignificant amount of fixed rate long term debt subject to interest rate risk
