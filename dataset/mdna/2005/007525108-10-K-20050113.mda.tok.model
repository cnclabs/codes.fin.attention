general adic is a leading provider of intelligent storage solutions for the open systems marketplace 
we design  market  sell and support hardware and software products that help a broad range of business and governmental organizations manage  access and protect their large scale data more effectively 
currently  we derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of tape and disk based storage solutions  storage software  connectivity solutions and related services and support 
we distribute our products primarily through oems  value added resellers vars and distributors  and also sell directly to certain end users 
we have achieved a compounded annual sales growth rate of approximately since fiscal  despite a challenging market during the past few years 
in fiscal  we experienced lower than anticipated sales volumes  which we attribute in part to general economic uncertainties and resource constraints of our customers due to the implementation of many new regulatory requirements  including the internal financial controls requirements under section of the sarbanes oxley act 
sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal  however  were up approximately from the million reported in the third quarter 
sales to branded customers  which tend to generate a higher gross margin percentage than our oem sales  reached a record million during the fourth quarter of fiscal as we enjoyed the benefits of new branded channels like emc and increased sales of our newest  technologically sophisticated products like the disk based pathlight vx solution 
gross profit decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal  primarily due to increased investment in global services and support  which outpaced revenue from lower than expected sales volumes of our branded enterprise products 
gross profit during the fourth quarter of fiscal  however  was at its highest level since the end of fiscal as a result of improved sales mix toward branded sales channels and advanced products 
in fiscal  our investment in sales and marketing increased to further develop sales channels and skills sufficient to support our technologically evolving product lines 
after experiencing significant increases over the past several years  research and development expenses moderately decreased during fiscal due largely to the timing of product development and lower incentive compensation expenses 
our general and administrative expenses remained flat year over year despite the growth in sales 
we generated an income tax benefit in fiscal as a result of tax planning strategies and the release of a tax contingency related to achieving successful tax audit results 
we expect that our long term tax rate will be closer to statutory rates  although there may be some additional one time benefits available in the near term 
we expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development and sales and marketing in order to remain competitive and to solidify our market position in intelligent storage solutions 
we are in the process of transforming our business from one that has historically been primarily focused on tape libraries to one with a broad portfolio of technologies and channels necessary to support software  disk and tape based solutions in the rapidly evolving backup and archive storage markets 
we believe our ability to serve broader markets with enterprise level products and software and to continually develop technologically sophisticated  higher margin branded products to replace entry level products that become commoditized and subject to increasing price pressure at the oem level will be key to our future success 
in addition  we view a comprehensive global service and support offering as an integral component of our strategy and our total customer solution 
in order to meet customer needs  the offerings of our global services group not only include the standard activities needed to ensure successful selection and on going support of products  but are also directly coupled with meeting dynamic customer requirements and innovative product design that can help minimize the need for conventional service 
service infrastructure and technology investment have been and are expected to continue to be major priorities  as we scale to meet our organizational growth and the needs of our expanding installed base 
we believe continued investment in sales and marketing and research and development is required in order to successfully penetrate new markets  reach new customers and expand our offerings 
the competition in our industry is strong and we must constantly work to reduce the cost of our existing products while retaining high quality standards and reliability 
we have outsourced the production of our entry level products and a portion of the repair of these products to third party manufacturers to allow us to take advantage of our suppliers economies of scale in component purchasing  manufacturing test and other areas associated with production of our higher volume  lower margin products 
since  in addition to our increased investment in internal research and development  we have made four acquisitions that enabled us to acquire new technologies 
these technologies include storage area network san software  other proprietary hardware and software technology that allow users to deploy sans  and disk based data protection products for the open systems market 
in addition to acquiring new technologies  the acquisitions allowed us to expand our operations in europe  gain a global services organization and add large libraries and proprietary software to our product offerings 
in november  we expanded an existing outsource manufacturing relationship with benchmark to include final assembly and test of a significant portion of our entry level and workgroup tape automation product line 
in connection with this expansion  we transferred to benchmark approximately team members associated with manufacturing  test and supply chain management 
benchmark assumed the lease on our redmond  washington manufacturing facility and purchased inventory associated with the product line and property  plant and equipment related to the operation for million in cash 
in june  we further expanded our existing outsource relationship to incorporate screening and repair of certain entry level and workgroup tape automation products 
in connection with this expansion  we transferred to benchmark certain team members from our customer service and repair operations in redmond 
additionally  benchmark purchased certain inventory and property  plant and equipment associated with these operations for million in cash 
there was no gain or loss recorded on any of these transactions 
in june  we announced the execution of a reseller agreement with emc pursuant to which emc sells adic tape libraries 
all products sold through emc bear the adic brand and all service associated with the products is the responsibility of adic 
we expect this expansion of our branded sales channel to gradually improve overall sales growth  however  there are no minimum purchase commitments under the arrangement  the quantity of products purchased by emc is based upon market demand and the agreement may be disruptive to our current business and sales channels 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we will begin recording the fair value of our share based compensation in our financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment revised 
the full impact that the adoption of this statement will have on our financial position and results of operations is not yet known  but we do not expect the impact will be material to the fiscal income statement 
foreign currency gains or losses arise as a result of our operation of european subsidiaries  the functional currencies of which are the euro and british pound sterling 
all assets are recorded in the functional currencies on the financial statements of these subsidiaries 
some us dollar denominated receivables and payables in these subsidiaries offset each other to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses 
to the extent that these monetary assets and liabilities do not fully offset each other and the us dollar exchange rate changes with respect to these currencies  transaction gains or losses may result 
our financial statements for the years ended october   and have been restated to correct our accounting for our investment in a limited partnership 
during fiscal  we determined that our investment in frazier technology venture fund i ftvi  a limited partnership  has been improperly accounted for since fiscal we initially accounted for our investment under the cost method since our ownership interest in ftvi is less than and we do not have significant influence over the partnership s operating and financial policies 
subsequently it was determined that the equity method is appropriate under eitf topic d  accounting for limited partnership investments  because our limited partnership ownership interest is greater than 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the following discussion and analysis gives effect to the restatement 
fiscal year compared to net sales 
net sales increased during fiscal to million from million in fiscal the increase is due to higher sales to both branded and oem customers 
annual growth rates of branded and oem sales during fiscal were and  respectively 
adic branded revenues represented of sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal revenue from oem customers comprised of sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal branded sales have increased in all major geographical markets in fiscal compared to fiscal the primary source of this growth was revenues from hardware service contracts and software maintenance contracts  which increased due to both new product sales and renewals of existing contracts 
the absolute dollar growth in oem sales is primarily due to increased sales of products introduced within the past two years 
during fiscal  we expect branded revenues to increase as a percentage of net sales as we continue to devote more focus on enterprise level products and software and less focus on the entry level tape libraries that comprise the bulk of our oem revenues 
dell and ibm accounted for fiscal revenues of million and million and fiscal revenues of million and million 
net sales outside the united states accounted for of our net sales in both fiscal and gross profit 
gross profit was million or of net sales for fiscal compared to million or of net sales for fiscal gross profit margins depend on a number of factors  including channel and product mix  fixed infrastructure costs  price competition and tape drive costs 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily a result of increased investment in our global services infrastructure to support our growing global customer base 
lower than expected sales volumes of branded enterprise products have caused the growth in our global services costs to outpace our revenue growth 
we expect gross margin will improve for fiscal as we execute on our strategy of shifting customer mix toward our branded channels and product mix toward newer  more technologically sophisticated products that include elements of our proprietary storage management software and connectivity technology 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million or of net sales for fiscal compared to million or of net sales for fiscal the absolute dollar increase is primarily the result of increased labor costs as we ve added headcount as part of our continued efforts to expand our sales channels in order to penetrate new markets  reach new customers and to support new product offerings 
during fiscal  we expect sales and marketing expenses to remain relatively flat as we leverage the investment we have made in sales and marketing over the past few years 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million or of net sales for fiscal compared to million or of net sales for fiscal we expect growth in absolute dollars of general and administrative expenses during fiscal  primarily related to our sarbanes oxley section compliance requirements and professional services fees to support ongoing tax and business strategy planning 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million or of net sales for fiscal compared to million or of net sales for fiscal two primary factors contributed equally to the decrease in fiscal research and development expenses 
the first was lower material costs in fiscal associated with product development efforts due to the timing of product introductions 
the second was a reduction in recorded incentive compensation expenses recorded in fiscal as compared to fiscal when the company met certain incentive compensation targets 
an increase in depreciation and other facilities costs offset approximately one half of these decreases 
we anticipate research and development spending to increase in absolute dollars during fiscal as we continue to invest in new product development and enhancements to our current product lines 
further  we believe the potential for growth in the market for storage solutions is sufficient to justify growth in our investment in research and development 
other income 
other income primarily consists of interest income  net foreign currency transaction gains and net gain on securities and investment transactions 
interest income for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal the increase in interest income in fiscal is primarily the result of higher average cash and investment balances during the year 
foreign currency transaction gains were million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
our net foreign currency transaction gains are impacted by fluctuations in the currency markets  and there is no assurance that we will experience the same types of gains on these transactions as in fiscal and other income includes a net gain on securities and investment transactions of  and million in fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  we recorded equity investment losses of  that reflected a reduction in the fair value of investments related to our million fiscal commitment to participate in a private technology venture limited partnership 
these losses represent our pro rata share of the limited partnership s net loss  which is primarily based on the general partner s estimates of the fair value of non marketable securities held by the partnership and  to a lesser extent  realized gains and losses from the partnership s disposal of securities 
in both years  securities gains primarily related to the conversion of one of our investments in a private company to cash and marketable equity securities  and the subsequent receipt of additional shares under earnout and escrow provisions and the sale of those securities 
in fiscal  we expect interest income to remain flat 
net foreign currency transaction gains losses and net gain loss on securities and investment transactions will be driven by prevailing market conditions 
provision benefit for income taxes 
for fiscal  income tax benefit was million compared to income tax expense of million in fiscal in fiscal we had an effective tax benefit of and in fiscal we had an effective tax expense of 
the tax benefit in fiscal reflects the tax benefits of our credit for research and development spending  our extraterritorial income exclusion  non taxable interest income and release of a tax contingency related to the favorable outcome of tax audits that have been concluded 
the effective tax benefit is not expected to be sustainable as the tax benefits will not grow as rapidly as the statutory tax expense during years of higher profitability 
it is reasonable to anticipate that our long term tax rate will be closer to statutory rates  although there may be some additional one time benefits available in the near term 
as a result of our modest income in  taxes paid in various federal  state and international jurisdictions moderately exceeded the tax benefits related to the three items described above  reflecting a relatively low tax expense 
fiscal year compared to net sales 
net sales increased during fiscal to million from million in fiscal the increase was due to higher sales to both oem and branded customers 
annual growth rates of oem and branded sales during fiscal were and  respectively 
revenue from oem customers comprised of sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal adic branded revenues represented of sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal the growth in oem sales was due to a combination of increasing penetration with existing products and the addition of new products 
branded sales increased in all major geographical markets in fiscal compared to fiscal the majority of this growth came in sales of enterprise level products and revenues from global services 
dell and ibm accounted for fiscal revenues of million and million and fiscal revenues of million and million 
net sales outside the united states accounted for of our net sales in fiscal and of our net sales in fiscal in fiscal  a portion of our net sales outside the united states was due to an oem customer for whom we maintained a revolver warehouse outside the united states 
during fiscal  all of the sales to this oem customer shifted to a revolver warehouse within the united states  which caused a decline in the reported percentage of non us sales 
this decline was partially offset by an increase in sales to european and asian customers 
gross profit 
gross profit was million or of net sales for fiscal compared to million or of net sales for fiscal  an increase of on a net sales increase of 
the increase in gross profit in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily a result of the absolute dollar increase in branded sales  including revenue from higher margin enterprise level products and software 
this increase was partially offset by the increase in the proportion of oem sales 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million or of net sales for fiscal compared to million or of net sales for fiscal the absolute dollar increase was due to continued efforts to expand our sales and services channels in order to enter new markets and new customers and to support new product offerings 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million or of net sales for fiscal compared to million or of net sales for fiscal the absolute dollar increase was attributable to an increase in overall compensation as a result of the company meeting certain incentive compensation targets and continued investments in our infrastructure  partially offset by decreases in bad debt expense 
in fiscal  bad debt expense was million  the majority of which was attributed to a single customer 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this represented a increase in our investment in research and development over our prior fiscal year 
in both years  research and development expenses were of net sales 
the increase in absolute dollars in fiscal reflected our strategy to maintain heavy investments in software and connectivity product development and related to added personnel resources and additional spending related to new products 
additionally  in fiscal we recorded an increase in overall compensation as a result of incentive compensation 
acquisition expenses 
expenses related to our acquisition of v stor were million during fiscal these one time acquisition charges related to acquired in process research and development and compensation to v stor personnel 
other income 
other income primarily consisted of net gain on securities and investment transactions  interest income and net foreign currency transaction gains 
other income was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal other income in fiscal included a gain on securities and investment transactions of million  which primarily related to conversion of one of our investments in a private company to cash and marketable equity securities  and the subsequent sale of the majority of those securities 
in fiscal  other income included a gain on marketable securities transactions of million  which was offset by a  charge for impairment of an investment we held in a private technology company 
the gains realized in fiscal consisted of gains from the sale of derivative financial instruments on securities we held for investment as well as the sale of marketable securities 
interest income for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal the decrease in interest income in fiscal was the result of lower returns on cash and investment balances during the year 
this decrease in interest income was partially offset by an increase in foreign currency transaction gains resulting from stronger european currencies 
provision benefit for income taxes 
we had income tax expense of million in fiscal compared to income tax benefit of million in fiscal in fiscal we had an effective tax expense of and in fiscal we had an effective tax benefit of 
the relatively low tax rate in fiscal reflected the tax benefits of our credit for research and development spending  our extraterritorial income exclusion and non taxable interest income 
as a result of our near breakeven taxable income in  taxes paid in various federal  state and international jurisdictions were exceeded by the tax benefits related to the three items described above 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
during fiscal  the difference between reported net income and cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to depreciation and amortization  an increase in deferred revenue and a decrease in accounts receivable  which were offset by increases in service parts for maintenance and inventories 
deferred revenue increased due to increased sales of hardware service contracts and software maintenance contracts  which are typically billed at the beginning of the contract term and recognized as revenue over the contract period  and certain software licenses that require deferral under generally accepted accounting principles 
accounts receivable decreased primarily due to the timing of collections from customers 
the increase in service parts for maintenance relates to the support of our growing installed base of products 
inventories increased primarily due to an increase in raw materials to support new products and customers 
in fiscal  the difference between reported net income and cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to depreciation and amortization and increases in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and deferred revenue  which were offset by increases in accounts receivable  inventories and service parts for maintenance 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased primarily due to the timing of payments 
as in fiscal  deferred revenue increased due to increased sales of service and maintenance contracts and certain software licenses 
accounts receivable increased primarily due to increased sales and the timing of such sales  and inventories and service parts for maintenance increased as we launched both new products and existing products into new channels 
during fiscal  the difference between reported net income and cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to depreciation and amortization  decreases in accounts receivable and inventories  an increase in deferred revenue  income tax refunds  and gains on securities and investment transactions  which were offset by an increase in service parts for maintenance 
inventories decreased as we entered into certain vendor managed inventory programs  under which ownership transfers at the time we take possession of inventory in the manufacturing process 
the increase in deferred revenue was due to increased sales of service and maintenance contracts 
as in fiscal  the increases in service parts for maintenance related to new product offerings as well as maintenance of our increasing installed base of existing solutions 
cash flows provided by used in investing activities included proceeds from certain securities transactions  primarily the maturities of marketable debt securities  sale of marketable equity securities and covered calls on shares owned by us  of million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
these proceeds were offset by purchases of marketable securities of million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively  and   and million of investments in non marketable securities of non public technology businesses during the same respective periods 
during fiscal  we received proceeds of million from the disposal of assets held for sale  which primarily comprised inventory and leasehold improvements related to the benchmark manufacturing outsourcing agreement completed during the year 
investments in property  plant and equipment were million  million and during fiscal  and  respectively 
capital expenditures during fiscal were comprised primarily of computer hardware and software to support initiatives within our global services and research and development organizations and tooling and equipment related to new product introductions 
capital expenditures during fiscal were comprised primarily of computer hardware and software for our global information technology infrastructure and tooling and equipment related to new product introductions 
capital expenditures during fiscal were comprised primarily of computer hardware and software associated with the global implementation of a customer relationship management information system and the worldwide rollout of our north american enterprise resource planning information system  leasehold improvements purchased for our new englewood  colorado facility and tooling and equipment related to new product introductions 
with respect to cash flows provided by used in financing activities  during fiscal  and  we received proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock purchase plan and the exercise of stock options and stock warrants of million  million and million  respectively 
we repurchased million   and million of our common stock during fiscal  and  respectively 
during fiscal  we borrowed  on a credit line from a german bank  which we repaid in full during the same year 
offsetting cash flows provided by financing activities in all periods were certain payments on short term and long term debt  which were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
all of our outstanding debt was repaid in full during the third quarter of fiscal at october   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million  up from million at october  our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million and million at october  and  respectively 
our working capital  the difference between current assets and current liabilities  was million at october  compared to million at october  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to and to at october  and  respectively 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash commitments as of october  payments due during fiscal years ended october  total thereafter in thousands operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations included in the operating lease amounts above are the cash commitments related to a liability recorded in fiscal to reflect the anticipated costs to exit the facility in englewood  colorado that we partially abandoned in fiscal this liability represents our estimate of the net amount of lease payments related to unused capacity of the facility 
during fiscal  we made payments of   of which related to unused capacity in the facility 
this  reduced the liability from  at october  to  at october  during fiscal  we made payments of  all of which related to unused capacity in the facility 
this  reduced the liability from  at october  to  at october  we believe the remaining liability of  at october  is adequate to cover the cost of unused capacity in the facility through the end of the lease term in december purchase obligations include accounts payable to our vendors and four remaining annual payments of  for a  patent license 
other commitments not included in the contractual cash commitments summary above include  in funding of investments in two limited partnership venture capital funds  which is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our october  balance sheet includes liabilities for the purchase obligations and the anticipated exit costs accrued during fiscal none of the other commitments mentioned above require accrual at october  we had no other material or unusual commitments as of october  based on our strong cash position  anticipated profitable operations and planned expenditures  including further investment in our product development strategy  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and anticipated cash flow from our operating activities will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
however  cash flows from operations could be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products as a result of rapid technological changes and other risks described under risk factors 
over the longer term  we may choose to fund our operations through the issuance of additional equity or debt financing 
the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our stockholders  and we cannot provide any assurance that such additional long term financing  if required  could be completed on favorable terms 
we will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of  or investments in businesses  products  or technologies that we believe are strategic  which may require the use of cash 
in addition  we have made and expect to continue to make investments in companies with whom we have identified potential synergies 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer agreements  sales returns  bad debts  inventory obsolescence  service parts for maintenance  warranty costs  investments  intangible assets  acquired in process technology  deferred income taxes  potential tax exposures and legal proceedings 
we base our estimates on a combination of specifically identified items we are aware of  historical trends  our expectations of the future and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of all our significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements that apply to us 
customer agreements and sales returns we record estimated reductions to revenue for specifically identified customer agreements  such as special pricing  price protection  stock rotation and volume based incentives  at the time of shipment 
these estimates are based upon the expected rate of occurrence taking into consideration both historical and current information 
if market conditions were to decline  we may take actions to enter into more of these agreements  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
we also record an allowance for sales returns for our estimates of expected customer product returns based on current sales and historical return rates 
should actual return rates differ from our estimates  revisions to our sales return allowance may be necessary 
since we have historically been able to reliably estimate the amount of allowances required for future price adjustments and product returns  we recognize revenue  net of projected allowances  upon shipment to our customers 
if we were unable to reliably estimate the amount of future price adjustments and product returns in any specific reporting period  then we would be required to defer recognition of the revenue until the right to future price adjustments and product returns were to lapse and we were no longer under any obligation to reduce the price or take back the product 
bad debts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate these losses based on specifically identified at risk receivables and the overall aging of our accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  and our ability to recognize sales to certain customers may be affected 
inventory obsolescence we evaluate our inventory and record a provision for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if technology rapidly changes or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
service parts for maintenance we value our service parts for maintenance at the lower of amortized cost or market 
amortization of the aggregate service parts is computed on the straight line method over the estimated useful life of three to seven years 
should the technology or our customers service needs change and cause a decrease in the estimated useful lives of such service parts  additional expense would be required 
warranty costs we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
investments we hold equity interests in private companies having operations or technology in areas within our strategic focus and limited partnership interests in private technology venture limited partnerships 
we also hold investment grade marketable debt securities in government and commercial entities 
we record an investment impairment charge when we obtain specific information that causes us to believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
for our interests in private technology venture limited partnerships  which are accounted for under the equity method  we record equity investment gains or losses equal to our pro rata share of the limited partnership s income or loss 
this income or loss is primarily based on the general partner s estimates of the fair value of non marketable securities held by the partnership and  to a lesser extent  realized gains and losses from the partnership s disposal of securities 
all estimates related to our non marketable securities are subject to the inherent uncertainty associated with the valuation of securities for which there is no public market 
intangible assets upon our adoption of sfas in the first quarter of fiscal  we ceased amortizing goodwill and performed an initial review for impairment 
goodwill impairment has been reviewed annually thereafter  or more frequently when indicators of impairment are present 
we did not record an impairment charge based on this initial review or our annual reviews performed during the third quarters of fiscal and other intangible assets are carried and reported at acquisition cost  net of accumulated amortization subsequent to acquisition 
the acquisition cost is amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from months to seven years 
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment might exist  or at least annually 
the determination of the net carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets and the extent to which  if any  there is impairment are dependent on material estimates and judgments on our part  including the useful life over which the intangible assets are to be amortized  and the estimates of the value of future net cash flows  which are based upon further estimates of future revenues  expenses and operating margins 
acquired in process technology when we enter into a business combination  we record an expense for the value of acquired in process technology that has not reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use as of the date of acquisition 
the valuation of acquired in process technology is typically based upon our estimates and valuations by a third party appraiser 
deferred income taxes during fiscal  we recorded a valuation allowance of million to reduce our deferred tax assets relating to our foreign tax credits and selected state net operating losses because we believe it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized 
we do not have a valuation allowance on any other deferred tax assets because we believe that the assets are more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the appropriateness of a valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would have a change in the realization of the net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset or valuation allowance would be made 
potential tax exposures and legal proceedings we record liabilities to address potential exposures related to business and income tax positions we have taken that have been or could be challenged by taxing authorities 
additionally  we record liabilities associated with legal proceedings and lawsuits 
these liabilities are recorded when the likelihood of payment is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
the determination for required liabilities is based upon analysis of each individual tax issue or legal proceeding  taking into consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments and the range of possible loss 
additionally  our analysis may include discussion with outside legal counsel 
the ultimate resolution of these potential tax exposures and legal proceedings may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk currently  approximately of our total international sales are denominated in us dollars  therefore we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the assets and liabilities of our non us subsidiaries have functional currencies other than the us dollar and are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
a appreciation in the us dollar would have resulted in an approximately million and million decrease in income before provision benefit for income taxes during fiscal and  respectively 
such a change in income would have resulted from applying a different exchange rate to translate and revalue the financial statements of our non us subsidiaries 
to hedge this exposure  we may enter into forward currency exchange contracts from time to time 
such contracts provide for the exchange of one currency for another at an agreed upon price at an agreed upon settlement date 
we had no such contracts outstanding as of october  interest rate risk from time to time we invest in marketable debt securities as part of our cash management policy and not for trading purposes 
these investments are subject to risks from changes in interest rates 
all such investments held as of october  have maturity dates of less than one year 
a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates applied to our current marketable debt securities would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows
