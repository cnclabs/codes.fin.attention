the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes  included elsewhere herein  as well as the section appearing in item of this form k under the caption business  for further information regarding risk factors 
the company s future operating results may be affected by various trends and factors  which are beyond the company s control 
these include  among other factors  general business and economic conditions  rapid technological changes accompanied by frequent new product introductions  competitive pressures  dependence on key customers  the attainment of design wins  fluctuations in quarterly and annual results  the reliance on a limited number of third party suppliers  limitations of the company s manufacturing arrangements  the protection of the company s proprietary technology  the dependence on key personnel  changes in critical accounting estimates  potential delays associated with the purchase and implementation of an advanced planning and scheduling system and potential impairments related to investments 
in addition  during weak economic periods  customers visibility deteriorates causing delays in the placement of orders 
these factors often result in a substantial portion of the company s revenue being derived from orders placed within a quarter and shipped in the final month of the same quarter 
matters discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this form k include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
overview performance technologies  incorporated is a supplier of platforms  components  software  and service solutions for the embedded systems marketplace that can be used in a broad range of applications and end markets 
since its founding in as a delaware corporation  the company has consistently designed innovative embedded products and component solutions that focus on attributes such as reduced time to market  enhanced performance  high availability and cost advantages for a user base that includes communications  military and commercial applications 
the company has a history of successfully adapting its products and services to a constantly changing  technology driven marketplace through the course of several business cycles that have occurred since its founding 
the company markets its products through its direct worldwide sales force under a variety of brand names including ipnexus  segway  nexusware and advanced managed platforms 
the company s ipnexus product line  based on open system architectures  consists of a wide range of embedded building blocks  which can be mixed and matched to construct highly integrated  packet based platforms 
beginning in  management adopted a new product strategy to reposition the company to deliver fully managed  system level platform solutions to the marketplace 
the launch of the advanced managed platform product line in september marked the introduction of an extensive family of platform solutions that enable equipment manufacturers to improve time to market for their products 
customers can select advanced managed platforms with the intelligent shelf manager  nexusware  various components and software to fit system and application requirements with full confidence that all elements have been designed and engineered to function together 
historically  the company s growth has been generated through a combination of internal growth and acquisition of new products or complementary technologies 
in october  the company acquired a portion of intel corporation s communications platform group for its chassis and compute products 
in january  the company completed the acquisition of the assets of mapletree networks to acquire its voice processing technology 
the products from both acquisitions have enhanced the company s product offerings to its customers 
the company continues to focus on acquisitions as an important part of its growth strategy 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions in preparing the financial statements in accordance with gaap  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue and expense amounts reported 
these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosures by the company  including information about contingencies  risk and financial condition 
the company generally can not make estimates until preliminary results for a financial quarter are known and analyzed 
the company believes  given current facts and circumstances  its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  adhere to gaap  and are consistently applied 
inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise 
the critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates that management believes have the most significant effect on the financial statements are set forth below o revenue recognition o software development costs o valuation of inventory o income taxes o product warranty o impairment of investments o carrying value of goodwill revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sale price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
additionally  the company sells its products on terms which transfer title and risk of loss at a specified location  typically shipping point 
accordingly  revenue recognition from product sales  which represents the majority of the company s revenue  occurs when all factors are met  including transfer of title and risk of loss  which occurs upon shipment by the company 
revenue earned from arrangements for software systems requiring significant production  modification  or customization of software is recognized over the contract period as performance milestones are fulfilled 
if all conditions of revenue recognition are not met  the company defers revenue recognition 
revenue from consulting and other services is recognized at the time the services are rendered 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as such losses are determined 
revenue from software maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the contractual period 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting estimate because the company s terms of sale can vary  and management exercises judgment in determining whether to defer revenue recognition 
such judgments may materially affect net sales for any period 
management exercises judgment within the parameters of gaap in determining when contractual obligations are met  title and risk of loss are transferred  sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
software development costs all software development costs incurred in establishing the technological feasibility of computer software products to be sold are research and development costs 
software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility of a computer software product to be sold and prior to general release of that product are capitalized 
amounts capitalized are amortized commencing after general release of that product over the estimated remaining economic life of that product  generally three years  or using the ratio of current revenues to current and anticipated revenues from such product  whichever provides greater amortization 
if in the judgment of management  technological feasibility for a particular project has not been met or recoverability of amounts capitalized is in doubt  project costs are expensed as research and development or charged to costs of goods sold  as applicable 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to software development costs is a critical accounting estimate because the company s management exercises judgment in determining whether project costs are expensed as research and development or capitalized as an asset 
such judgments may materially affect expense amounts for any period 
management exercises judgment within the parameters of gaap in determining when technological feasibility has been met and recoverability of software development costs is reasonably assured 
valuation of inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  using the first in  first out method 
the company s inventory includes purchased parts and components  work in process and finished goods 
the company provides inventory reserves for excess  obsolete or slow moving inventory after periodic evaluation of historical sales  current economic trends  forecasted sales  estimated product lifecycles and estimated inventory levels 
the factors that contribute to inventory valuation risks are the company s purchasing practices  electronic component obsolescence  accuracy of sales and production forecasts  introduction of new products  product lifecycles and the associated product support 
the company manages its exposure to inventory valuation risks by maintaining safety stocks  minimum purchase lots  managing product end of life issues brought on by aging components or new product introductions  and by utilizing certain inventory minimization strategies such as vendor managed inventories 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to valuation of inventories is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to changes from period to period due to the requirement for management to make estimates relative to each of the underlying factors ranging from purchasing  to sales  to production  to after sale support 
if actual demand  market conditions or product lifecycles are adversely different from those estimated by management  inventory adjustments to lower market values would result in a reduction to the carrying value of inventory  an increase in inventory write offs and a decrease to gross margins 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of the temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of such assets and liabilities 
the company would record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to income taxes is a critical accounting estimate because the company exercises judgment in estimating future taxable income  including prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  in assessing the need for any valuation allowance 
if the company should determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  in the event that the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
product warranty the company has warranty obligations in connection with the sale of certain of its products 
the warranty period for these products is generally one year 
the costs incurred to provide for these warranty obligations are estimated and recorded as an accrued liability at the time of sale 
the company estimates its future warranty costs based on historical performance rates and related costs to repair given products 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to product warranty is a critical accounting estimate because the company exercises judgment in determining future estimated warranty costs 
should actual performance rates or repair costs differ from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
impairment of investments during  the company held convertible debt and equity investments in one company and in  made a debt investment in another company 
on a periodic basis  the company reviews and evaluates its investments for potential impairment 
in determining whether impairment has occurred  the company considers such factors as the original expectations of the investment  performance of the investee company since the date of the investment  and current and future prospects for the investee company 
if events or changes in circumstances occur in which an other than temporary loss has occurred  the company will record an impairment of the investment by writing down the investment to the company s estimate of fair value at the time of the impairment 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to impairment of investments is a critical accounting estimate because the company exercises judgment in determining whether an other than temporary loss has occurred and the company also estimates the fair value of the investment at the time of the impairment 
carrying value of goodwill the company conducts tests for impairments of goodwill annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to goodwill is a critical accounting estimate because these impairment tests include management estimates of future cash flows that are dependent upon subjective assumptions regarding future operating results including growth rates  discount rates  capital requirements and other factors that impact the estimated fair value 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that an asset s carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
strategy the company has a history of successfully adapting its products and services to a constantly changing technology driven marketplace 
this adaptation has been demonstrated through the course of several business cycles that have occurred since its founding in during the most recent economic downturn  the company maintained its commitment to aggressively fund new product development  as well as use its strong balance sheet to acquire additional products and technologies to strengthen its market position 
beginning in  a new product strategy was adopted 
this strategy repositioned the company to deliver fully managed  system level platform solutions to the embedded systems marketplace 
an important milestone in this strategy was achieved in september with the introduction of the advanced managed platform product line 
throughout  the company focused its operating efforts on this strategy 
this new line of platform solutions specifically addresses equipment manufacturers requirements for an increased level of system integration and services from suppliers 
the company s new platform products enable equipment manufacturers downsized or limited engineering staffs to improve time to market for their new products and to replace proprietary or legacy platforms with the latest generation of fully managed system functionality 
please refer to part  item  under the caption business  for further information regarding the company s strategy 
key performance indicators the company s integrated platforms  components and software solutions are incorporated into current and next generation embedded systems infrastructure 
traditionally  design wins have been an important metric for management to judge the company s product acceptance in its marketplace 
design wins  if implemented  reach production volumes at varying rates  generally beginning twelve to eighteen months after the design win occurs 
a variety of risks such as schedule delays  cancellations  changes in customer markets and economic conditions can adversely affect a design win before production is reached  or during deployment 
the company modified its criteria for the measurement of design wins in to provide greater granularity in predicting forward looking potential for the company and to assist in measuring day to day execution of product  sales and marketing programs 
during  the company was notified of design wins for its products with each expected to generate greater than 
million of annualized revenue when reaching production volumes 
these new design wins were for its integrated platform solutions with multiple products  and individual component design wins for ipnexus access  ip switching  segway  and voice processing products 
during  the company s metric for design wins only included customers that were expected to generate greater than million of annualized revenue when reaching production volumes 
based on this measurement criterion  the company was notified of design wins for its products 
these design wins were for its integrated platform solutions with multiple products  individual component design wins for ip switching  ipnexus access  computing products and segway products 
not all design wins are expected to result in production orders 
regardless of the change in the measurement metric  the company believes that the growth in the number of design wins for integrated platform solutions from to reflects increasing customer demand for more complete platform solutions from a single vendor 
management believes another key indicator for the company s business is the volume of orders received from its customers 
during weak economic periods  customers visibility deteriorates causing delays in the placement of orders 
while forward looking visibility on customer orders continues to be very limited  shipments to customers in amounted to million including the vtg products and million excluding the vtg products  compared to million in revenue in was impacted by a decline in business from the company s two largest customers in  andrew corporation and ut starcom  inc shipments to these two customers declined by million  to million in due to changes in their businesses 
industry overview as began  the company s customers  who are primarily equipment manufacturers in the telecom and data communications market segments  continued to maintain tight cost controls  limit engineering resources and proceed with realigned business models 
these fiscal controls created a more concentrated supplier landscape for that is trimmer  but more highly focused on market opportunities 
it was not just these equipment manufacturers who made such adjustments 
across the technology sector  many organizations downsized staffs and tightened cost controls  including many of our customers and suppliers 
industry marketing research organizations  such as dataquest and venture development corporation  are estimating the worldwide  embedded systems market to be over billion in size by traditionally  the largest segment of this market uses proprietary  purpose built embedded systems and products 
embedded systems built on open standards comprise a smaller segment of this market  which is estimated to grow to over billion by while proprietary systems are expected to continue to dominate this market in the future  a growing share of embedded systems being implemented  especially in the more limited market segments served by the company  is expected to use open standards based products 
the driving factors behind this changing paradigm remain twofold 
first  systems are becoming increasingly integrated  more complex  requiring larger investments and longer lead times to design 
second  as organizations have downsized over the past several years  they have not replaced the necessary staff to carry out extensive new product development while successfully meeting the competitive pressures of time to market found in most technology businesses 
due to these changes  telecom and data communications equipment manufacturers are increasing their reliance on companies such as performance technologies to deliver major building blocks or complete platforms  allowing the supplier to layer on their value add which has become software and or additional hardware elements directed at specific applications 
please refer to part  item  under the caption business  for further discussion of the industry  economic environment and the company s initiatives for financial revenue revenue for amounted to million  compared to million in the increase in revenue of million includes million of revenue from the newly acquired voice technology group

the initial investment consisted of cash and the assumption of certain debt at closing of million and other acquisition costs of 
million 
the company agreed to pay an additional million of purchase price if the operations of the acquired group operated by the company on a stand alone basis achieved certain milestones earn out 
based upon the operating results of the acquired group in the second quarter  the earn out was terminated 
during the fourth quarter  the company resolved certain matters related to the acquisition resulting in a payment to the company of approximately million  which represented a partial return of purchase price 
beginning at the time of acquisition  the company s revenue and expenses reflect the operations of vtg 
momentum computer  inc momentum momentum is a developer of specialized single board computer products 
at the time of the company s initial investment in september  the company acquired a ownership interest in momentum 
during  the company reduced its ownership in momentum to when the company sold a portion of its investment back to the majority stockholder of momentum 
based upon the company s expectations of momentum s performance at the time of the investment and its business prospects in late  the company concluded that an other than temporary impairment of this investment occurred and the company recorded an impairment charge of 
million for this investment during the fourth quarter during the third quarter  the company completed the sale of its investment in momentum for million and realized a gain of million 
cash received in the fourth quarter from the sale amounted to million  including the collection of a million note receivable 
inscitek microsystems  inc inscitek on february   the company entered into an agreement to invest up to million in inscitek in the form of an interest bearing convertible note 
during  the company invested million in conjunction with this agreement including committed funding of 
million in january 
as of december   inscitek had not raised sufficient outside capital to assure its future as a going concern 
therefore  during the fourth quarter  the company recorded a valuation charge related to this note receivable in the amount of million as collection of this note is doubtful 
the company has the option to acquire ownership of inscitek during a future specified period 
the note bears interest at annually and is convertible into shares of common stock of inscitek 
all unpaid accrued interest and all outstanding principal is payable in full on december  centralization of functions during most of  uncertainty in the telecommunications sector using the company s products and services placed pressure on revenue and operating earnings 
despite this weakness  management continues to believe the company is strategically positioned to improve its financial performance when target markets become more positive 
nonetheless  management began formulating plans and taking steps in september to reduce annualized expenses by approximately million with a primary focus on centralizing its multi location operations and streamlining the organization 
during  the company completed integration of the vtg sales  marketing and administrative functions into its corporate operations and during the first quarter  management expects to complete the integration of the vtg accounting and manufacturing operations into the existing rochester  ny  headquarters 
also during the first quarter  the company began transitioning the accounting and manufacturing operations of the computing products group in san luis obispo  ca  to its rochester headquarters 
this transition is expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter during  the company incurred a charge of 
million related to these restructuring efforts 
additional charges related to restructuring actions are expected during when this centralization plan is completed  operating expenses are expected to be reduced by million annually and manufacturing overhead cost of goods is expected to be reduced by 
million annually 
however  the company expects to increase expenditures in certain areas during to stimulate growth

this revenue is related to legacy products 
gross profit 
gross profit consists of sales  less cost of goods sold including material costs  manufacturing expenses  depreciation  amortization of software development costs  expenses associated with engineering contracts and technical support function expenses 
gross margin was and of sales in and  respectively 
gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased in primarily because of the increase in shipments of lower margin computing products 
gross margins for computing products are generally lower than the gross margins realized by the company s other product categories because the computing products are more hardware centric products and include less proprietary technology as compared to the company s other products 
since the computing products group s operations were included for the full year in  compared with only three months in  revenue from computing products constituted a greater percentage of total revenue causing a decrease in overall gross margins 
the decrease in gross margins attributable to the computing products was partially offset by increases in gross margin for the other product categories as the company s fixed manufacturing overhead was spread over a larger volume of shipments in  compared to total operating expenses 
total operating expenses amounted to million in  compared to million in for  the operating expenses include a full year of operations of the computing products group  compared to only three months in during  the company took actions to improve its cost structure by more appropriately aligning expenses with current revenue levels 
these expense reductions amounted to million annually and were attained by reducing staffing levels by approximately and by consolidating one remote office location to more efficiently provide engineering and product support 
selling and marketing expenses totaled million in  compared to million in this increase of million in is primarily attributable to the inclusion of the computing products group for a full year of operations amounting to million and an increase of 
million related to additional sales people and related expenses 
research and development expenses totaled million and million in and  respectively 
this increase of million in is primarily attributable to the inclusion of the computing products group for a full year increasing expense by million
