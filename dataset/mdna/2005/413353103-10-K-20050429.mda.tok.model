seasonality the company s business is subject to seasonal influences  with the major portion of sales realized during the fall season third and fourth quarters of each year  which includes the fall and holiday selling seasons 
in light of this pattern  selling  general and administrative expenses are typically higher as a percentage of sales during the spring seasons first and second quarters of each year 
inflation inflation affects the costs incurred by the company in its purchase of merchandise and in certain components of its selling  general and administrative expenses

inflation has had no meaningful effect on sales or net earnings of the company 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to management s discussion and analysis 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
changes to these assumptions and estimates could have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
however  the company believes it has taken reasonable but conservative positions  where assumptions and estimates are used  in order to minimize the negative financial impact to the company that could result if actual results vary from the assumptions and estimates 
in management s opinion  the areas of the company where the most significant judgment is exercised is in the allowance for doubtful accounts related to the company s proprietary credit card program  the valuation of inventory  asset impairment estimates and revenue recognition 
the selection  application and disclosure of the following critical accounting estimates have been discussed with the company s audit committee 
in  approximately of the company s net retail sales were made under its proprietary credit card program  which resulted in customer accounts receivable balances of approximately  at january  the company has significant experience in managing its credit card program 
each month  the company reviews all of its credit card accounts and writes off those deemed uncollectible 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts is maintained and periodically reviewed 
the allowance is primarily based on account write off trends and aging information 
the company does not expect actual results to vary significantly from its estimate 
the company uses the retail inventory method 
under this method  the company records markdowns to value merchandise inventories at net realizable value 
the company closely monitors actual and forecasted sales trends  current inventory levels  and aging information by merchandise categories 
if forecasted sales are not achieved  additional markdowns may be needed in future periods to clear excess or slow moving merchandise  which may result in lower gross margins 
when a store experiences unfavorable operating performance  the company evaluates whether an impairment charge should be recorded 
a store s assets are evaluated for impairment by comparing the store s estimated undiscounted cash flows to the assets carrying value 
if the cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value  the assets are written down to fair value 
impairment losses associated with these reviews have not been significant 
however  if comparative store sales decline  future impairment losses could be significant 
sales from store locations represented of the company s total sales for these sales are recognized at the time of the customer s purchase 
sales are net of returns and exclude sales tax 
the company s direct catalog and internet sales represented about one percent of the total sales during these sales are recognized at the time the order is shipped to the customer 
gift card sales are recognized as revenue when the gift card is redeemed  not when it is sold 
impact of new accounting pronouncements on december   the fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised sfas r  share based payment  which must be adopted by the company no later than january  sfas r requires an entity to recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments granted to employees 
the company will adopt sfas r in the required period and apply the standard using the modified prospective method  which requires compensation expense to be recorded for new and modified awards 
for any unvested portion of previously issued and outstanding awards  compensation expense is required to be recorded based on the previously disclosed sfas methodology  and amounts 
prior periods presented are not required to be restated 
the company is still assessing the impact on its results of operations and financial position upon the adoption of sfas r 
commitments the following table reflects certain of the company s commitments as of january  payments due by period in thousands less more than than contractual total year years obligations years years long term debt   store leases      operating leases      other than stores purchase obligations estimated interest      payments total      the expiration of the company s loan agreement  which represents the overwhelming majority of this amount  is february  it is unlikely such debt will be repaid within one year 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
store leases are based on minimum rents exclusive of percentage rent based on sales which could increase rental expense 
the foregoing table does not include contractual commitments pursuant to executory contracts for products and services such as telephone  data  computer maintenance and other regular payments pursuant to contracts that are expected to remain in existence for several years but as to which the company s obligations are contingent upon the company s continued receipt of the contracted products and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about the company s potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk for the company refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and various foreign currencies 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how the company views and manages its ongoing market risk exposures 
interest rate at january   the company had debt outstanding of approximately million 
of this amount  million bears interest at a weighted average fixed rate of 
the remaining million bears interest at a variable rate  which averaged approximately during a increase in short term interest rates on the variable rate debt outstanding at january  would approximate basis points 
such an increase in interest rates would increase the company s interest expense by approximately  assuming borrowed amounts remain outstanding 
the above sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk excludes accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities because of the short term maturity of such instruments 
the analysis does not consider the effect this movement may have on other variables including changes in sales volumes that could be indirectly attributed to changes in interest rates 
the actions management would take in response to such a change is also not considered 
if it were possible to quantify this impact  the results could well be different than the sensitivity effects shown above 
the table below provides information about the company s debt obligations that are sensitive to changes in interest rates expected maturity in thousands thereaf total ter long term debt variable rate   weighted average interest rate fixed rate weighted average interest rate foreign currency substantially all of the company s purchases are priced in us dollars 
however  some european purchases are denominated in local currency and  therefore  are subject to the fluctuation in currency exchange rates 
from time to time the company utilizes forward exchange contracts to secure firm pricing related to purchase commitments to be denominated in foreign currencies 
the contracts are of varying short term durations and amounts include a window delivery feature  which provides the company with an option to enter into a swap agreement in the event that all of the currency is not utilized at the end of the contract s delivery term 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 
the principal currency hedged is the italian lira 
the company regularly monitors its foreign exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions 
however  there can be no assurance the company s foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its results of operations and financial position 
the company had no foreign exchange instruments outstanding at january   therefore  a sensitivity analysis would result in no impact to earnings 
anticipated transactions  firm commitments  and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies would be excluded from the sensitivity analysis 
additionally  as the company utilizes foreign currency instruments for hedging anticipated and firmly committed transactions  a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying exposure 
foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on the company during  or
