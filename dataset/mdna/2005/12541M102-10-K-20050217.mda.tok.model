item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following is management s assessment of certain significant factors affecting the financial condition and operating results of energy group and its subsidiaries over the past three years 
the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contain additional data 
for the twelve months ended december   of energy group s operating revenues were derived from central hudson s electric service  from central hudson s natural gas service  and from the competitive business subsidiaries 
for the purposes of this k annual report  per share refers to the shares of common stock issued by energy group 
executive summary energy group is a holding company that conducts substantially all of its business operations through its subsidiaries 
energy group s current business operations are focused primarily in two areas of the energy industry the purchase  sale at wholesale  and retail distribution of electricity and natural gas in portions of new york state through central hudson  and the business of marketing petroleum products and related services to retail customers through chec subsidiaries griffith and scasco 
because of the diversity among their respective operations  energy group reports the results of the regulated business and the competitive business subsidiaries as separate segments in its consolidated financial statements 
management focuses its strategic efforts on those areas of the company that it believes would have the greatest effect on shareholder value 
efficient operations are a key aspect of increasing shareholder value 
as discussed below  management has implemented plans to achieve savings through continued expense control and through new initiatives 
in addition  because central hudson is subject to rate regulation  the approved regulatory treatment on various matters could significantly affect central hudson s operations and  therefore  its financial position and results of operations 
as discussed below  central hudson intends to seek approval of a new rate plan in the near future 
please note that this executive summary section is merely a summary and should be read together with the remainder of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this k annual report  as well as the audited consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  and the other information included in this k annual report 
in review in  energy group and central hudson each achieved earnings within the ranges that each company had projected at the beginning of the year energy group earned per share on a consolidated basis in  of which central hudson contributed per share 
energy group s earnings decreased per share and central hudson s earnings increased per share in  as compared to  and as discussed in detail by business unit below 
central hudson s earnings were driven by consistent sales growth and continued expense control  as they have been in past years 
these factors are also reflected in central hudson s favorable performance under the settlement agreement central hudson earned above the settlement agreement s threshold return on its ratemaking equity after sharing earnings above that threshold as mandated by the settlement agreement with its customers 
in addition to its improved earnings  central hudson achieved rising customer satisfaction for the sixth consecutive year and electric delivery rates among the lowest in new york state  and despite a continued difficult financial environment for the energy industry maintained its solid a credit rating  placing central hudson near the top of the industry in terms of creditworthiness 
central hudson also received a supportive decision from the psc that allowed it to net certain of its deferred regulatory assets against a significant portion of its regulatory liabilities  reducing the magnitude of pressures for future rate increases and prospective debt issuance 
chec contributed per share to energy group s earnings  a increase as compared to its contribution in this increase was primarily a result of increased contributions from its fuel distribution subsidiaries  griffith and scasco  and its investments in cogeneration partnerships 
major initiatives were launched in to improve the profitability of griffith s and scasco s service departments  the efficiency of their delivery functions  and the effectiveness of their marketing efforts 
energy group expects these initiatives to enhance chec s future contributions to earnings 
energy group s unconsolidated earnings of per share  while reduced from levels  largely reflect increased business development expenses related to energy group s continuing efforts to redeploy its available cash reserves with a view to produce appropriate risk adjusted returns on capital and replace  in whole or in part  income produced by amortizations which expired in at december   energy group s cash reserves available for redeployment were approximately million and are currently invested in money market instruments and short term securities with low principal risk 
energy group s significant redeployment in occurred in november a million investment by chec in the cornhusker energy lexington fuel ethanol production plant to be located in lexington  nebraska 
this investment is expected to make a contribution to earnings following completion of the plant s construction in the fourth quarter of in addition  energy group devoted much time and effort to the internal control reviews required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of these reviews were completed in a timely manner and to the satisfaction of management 
no material weaknesses were found in energy group s internal control over financial reporting 
looking ahead energy group has identified the following goals as priorities for o redeploy a significant portion of energy group s available cash reserves in energy related investments with appropriate risk adjusted returns  o develop a regulatory filing to increase central hudson s rates in order to fully recover the current and future cost of providing service  o continue to improve productivity  primarily through process improvement and the application of technology  o maintain central hudson s strong credit rating  o continue to improve the earnings and cash flow contributions of griffith and scasco through growth and profitability improvements  and o continue to develop staff  especially those who will provide critical leadership throughout energy group in the years ahead 
competition deregulation holding company energy group is the holding company parent corporation of central hudson and chec  as described under the caption subsidiaries of energy group in item business of this k annual report 
energy group s operations are conducted through central hudson  chec  and the other competitive business subsidiaries 
energy group s common stock trades on the new york stock exchange under the symbol chg 
the holding company structure was instituted to permit quick response to changes in the evolving competitive energy industry 
the structure permits the use of financing techniques that are better suited to the particular requirements  characteristics  and risks of competitive operations without affecting the capital structure or creditworthiness of central hudson 
this increases energy group s financial flexibility by allowing it to establish different capital structures for each of its individual lines of business 
energy group is seeking to redeploy million in energy related assets from the sales of central hudson s interests in its major generating assets and energy group s sale of ch resources 
chec s business plan chec s primary focus is fuel oil distribution and related services  and chec expects such focus to continue 
chec s fuel distribution subsidiaries  griffith and scasco  continue to explore opportunities to expand through both internal growth and acquisitions  depending on financial performance and opportunities available 
there can be no assurance that such expansion opportunities will exist  or if consummated  that they will be profitable

results of operations the following discussion and analyses include explanations of significant changes in revenues and expenses between and and between and for both energy group and central hudson 
additional information relating to changes between these years is provided in the notes 
earnings earnings per share basic and diluted of energy group s common stock are computed on the basis of the average number of common shares outstanding basic and diluted during the subject year 
the number of average shares outstanding of energy group common stock  the earnings per share  and the rate of return earned on average common equity  which is net income as a percentage of a monthly average of common equity  are as follows average shares outstanding basic    diluted    earnings per share basic diluted return earned on common equity energy group s consolidated basic earnings per share for were per share  a decrease of per share from earnings of 
the per share decrease was comprised of a per share reduction at the holding company and a per share increase at both central hudson and chec 
energy group s the holding company earnings fell per share as compared to due primarily to a reduction in investment income and an increase in business development costs 
the reduction in investment income resulted from the full liquidation  by july  of energy group s alternate investment program and the reinvestment of the proceeds in lower yield money market instruments and short term securities with low principal risk 
the increase in business development costs reflects energy group s intensified efforts to redeploy its available capital in suitable investment opportunities 
earnings for central hudson increased per share in as compared to due primarily to a reduction in regulatory carrying charges due to customers and an increase in electric and natural gas net operating revenues net of the cost of purchased electricity  purchased natural gas  and revenue taxes 
the reduction in carrying charges was due largely to a declining customer benefit fund balance 
in addition to the continuation of customer refunds in and the funding of economic development initiatives and other programs  the customer benefit fund was also used to offset deferred pension and other post employment benefit costs  as authorized in central hudson s joint proposal approved by the psc effective july  see note regulatory matters under the caption rate proceedings electric and natural gas for more details 
electric net operating revenues increased due to a increase in sales reflecting increased usage by existing industrial customers and an increase in residential and commercial sales primarily due to customer growth 
the increase in natural gas net revenues is primarily due to an increase in large industrial transportation revenues and the recovery of increased working capital and bad debt costs 
the milder weather experienced during the first half of the year as compared to decreased net revenues from natural gas sales by approximately per share  net of the effect of weather hedging contracts  however  this was partially offset by growth in firm natural gas deliveries 
also enhancing earnings was the favorable impact of a lower number of energy group common stock shares outstanding and a reduction in income taxes 
the increase in earnings for central hudson was largely offset by the effect of certain electric regulatory mechanisms  an increase in depreciation and amortization on utility plant assets  and an increase in property and payroll taxes 
electric regulatory mechanisms affecting earnings were an increase in electric shared earnings and potential psc assessments for service interruptions 
the increase in shared earnings resulted from an increase in ratemaking operating income in as compared to and a reduction in the sharing threshold per the provisions of the joint proposal effective july chec s earnings also increased by per share as compared to  largely driven by a reduction in operating expenses 
the reduction in expenses was due to improved operating efficiencies at griffith and scasco  lower sales due to milder weather experienced in the first half of the year  and the sale of scasco s natural gas business unit in october the increase in earnings was partially offset by a decrease in net revenues net of fuel and other related expenses from griffith and scasco 
net revenues were reduced by the sale of scasco s natural gas business and a reduction in gross profit from sales of petroleum products resulting from customer conservation due to the increased cost of heating oil 
the reduction in net revenues was partially offset by an increase in service department gross profit 
chec s earnings were also enhanced by an increase in net income from its energy services projects and investments in partnerships 
consolidated basic earnings per share for energy group were for as compared to in  an increase of per share 
the increase in earnings reflects a per share increase from central hudson operations due largely to increases in electric and natural gas net operating revenues net of the cost of purchased electricity  purchased natural gas  and revenue taxes  an increase in the amortization of shareholder benefits relating to the sale of central hudson s interests in its major generating assets  the favorable effect of the recording of regulatory carrying charges  a reduction of interest charges and preferred stock dividends  and the positive impact of energy group s repurchases of its common stock  further described in note capitalization energy group capital stock 
the increase in net revenues results from an increase in sales volume due to the colder weather experienced in the early part of and customer growth  a reduction in shared earnings  and the recording of previously deferred electric and natural gas delivery revenues to income over the twelve months ended june  the increase in net revenues was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses  increased depreciation on utility plant assets  and the effect of non recurring income recorded in from the sale of insurance stock 
the stock was received due to the demutualization of certain insurance companies through which central hudson provided employee benefits 
earnings for chec decreased per share in as compared to resulting largely from a per share reduction relating to the net gain recorded in from the sale of ch resources 
the decrease in earnings was largely offset by an increase in earnings from operations due to increased fuel oil distribution sales volumes attributable to the colder weather in  the acquisition of the assets of certain fuel oil distribution companies in the fourth quarter of and in january  and increases in productivity and a related reduction in operating expenses 
the earnings from griffith and scasco increased from per share in to per share in a nominal gain on the sale of scasco s natural gas business unit in october and the favorable impact of energy group s common stock repurchase program also partially offset the reduction in earnings 
the increase in consolidated earnings in was also partially offset by a per share reduction in earnings  mainly from the liquidation of energy group s alternate investment program by july and the absence of favorable state income tax adjustments recorded in related to the sale of central hudson s interest in its major generating assets in proceeds from the liquidation of approximately million were reinvested in lower yield money market instruments with lower principal risk 
operating revenues total operating revenues of energy group decreased million  or  in as compared to  and increased million  or  in as compared to see the table below for details of the variations increase or decrease from prior year electric gas other total electric gas other total in thousands operating revenues customer sales a  b    b  sales to other utilities 
  energy cost adjustment       deferred revenues c     miscellaneous   subtotal       competitive business subsidiary sales d     total         a includes delivery of electricity and natural gas supplied by others and an offsetting restoration of revenues from central hudson s customer benefit fund described in note regulatory matters under the captions summary of regulatory assets and liabilities and rate proceedings electric and natural gas for customer refunds to all customers and back out credits for retail access customers 
b includes both firm and interruptible revenues 
c includes the restoration of other revenues from central hudson s customer benefit fund for other authorized programs  the restoration of previously deferred delivery revenues  and the deferral of electric and natural gas shared earnings in accordance with the provisions of the joint proposal effective july   and described in note regulatory matters 
d the increase of million in as compared to primarily reflects increased sales of petroleum products due to colder weather and acquisitions of additional fuel oil distribution companies in the fourth quarter of and in january sales central hudson central hudson s revenues from sales vary seasonally in response to weather 
in particular  electric revenues peak in the summer while natural gas revenues peak in the winter 
utility delivery sales of electricity within central hudson s service territory increased in as compared to sales to residential customers increased  sales to commercial customers increased  and sales to industrial customers increased 
sales to residential and commercial customers increased due primarily to customer growth and increased usage despite milder weather in the first half of and a cooler summer  in each case as compared to industrial sales increased due to additional usage by existing customers 
actual heating billing degree days in were lower than in and lower than normal 
actual cooling billing degree days for july through september were lower than in and lower than normal 
utility delivery sales of natural gas to firm central hudson customers decreased in as compared to residential and commercial sales  primarily space heating sales  decreased and  respectively  due largely to a decrease in usage resulting from the milder weather experienced in the first half of the decrease in sales was partially offset by customer growth 
industrial sales  representing approximately of total firm sales in and  decreased 
interruptible sales increased due largely to an increase in sales to large industrial natural gas transportation customers 
utility delivery sales of electricity within central hudson s service territory increased in as compared to sales to residential customers increase  sales to commercial customers increased and sales to industrial customers increased 
the across the board increase in delivery sales was due largely to colder weather and a modest increase in the average number of residential and commercial customers 
billing heating degree days were higher than last year and higher than normal 
utility delivery sales of natural gas to firm central hudson customers increased in as compared to the prior year 
residential and commercial sales  primarily space heating sales  both increased by due to the colder weather experienced in and modest growth in the average number of customers 
industrial sales  representing approximately of total firm sales in and in  decreased slightly by 
interruptible sales decreased due to a reduction in the sale of natural gas for electric generation and to the curtailment of interruptible service to meet increased demand from firm customers 
changes in delivery sales by major customer classification  including interruptible natural gas sales  are set forth below 
increase decrease from prior year electric mwh natural gas mcf residential commercial industrial interruptible n a n a mwh means megawatt hour 
because of sharing arrangements established for interruptible natural gas sales and interruptible transportation of customer owned natural gas  as described under the caption incentive arrangements below  variations in these sales from year to year typically have a minimal impact on earnings 
incentive arrangements under certain earnings sharing formulas approved by the psc  central hudson either shares with its customers certain revenues and or cost savings exceeding predetermined levels or is penalized in some cases for shortfalls from certain performance standards 
earnings sharing formulas are currently effective for interruptible natural gas sales  natural gas capacity release transactions  electric service reliability  certain aspects of customer service and satisfaction  and certain aspects of market participant satisfaction 
see note regulatory matters under the caption rate proceedings electric and natural gas for a description of earnings sharing formulas approved by the psc for central hudson 
the net results of these and previous earnings sharing formulas also had the effect of increasing pretax earnings by million  million  and million during   and  respectively  above the applicable sharing thresholds 
sales and revenues competitive business subsidiaries sales chec s sales of petroleum products decreased million gallons  or  to million gallons in from million gallons in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in heating oil of million gallons  or  to million gallons in from million gallons in this decrease was primarily due to warmer weather as evidenced by a average decrease in heating degree days for as compared to and customer conservation due to the increased cost of heating oil 
additionally  the sales of propane decreased million gallons  or  from million gallons in to million gallons in this decrease is also primarily due to the warmer weather in in comparison to partially offsetting these decreases  motor fuel sales increased million gallons  or  from million gallons in to million gallons in due to the sale of certain assets and liabilities of scasco s natural gas business unit on october   there were no sales of natural gas in as compared to sales of  mcf in chec s sales of petroleum products increased million gallons  or  to million gallons in from million gallons in this increase was primarily due to colder weather as evidenced by a average increase in heating degree days for as compared to  and increased sales as a result of acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of and in january in  chec s sales of natural gas decreased approximately  mcf  or  to  mcf as compared to  mcf in this decrease was primarily due to the sale of certain assets and liabilities of scasco s natural gas business unit on october  revenues total revenues for chec  net of the effect of weather hedging contracts  increased million  or  from million in to million in revenues from petroleum products increased million  or  from million in to million in largely due to an increase in motor fuel revenues 
these revenues increased million  or  from million in to million in due primarily to a rise in the average selling price of motor fuels and an increase in sales volume 
heating oil revenues also increased million to million largely due to the effect of weather hedging contracts with more favorable terms for than partially offsetting the overall increase in revenues was a reduction of million in natural gas revenues due to the sale of scasco s natural gas business unit in october other revenues related to service and installations  energy services  and propane sales decreased by million 
total revenues  net of weather hedging contracts  increased million  or  from million in to million in revenues from petroleum products increased million  or  to million from million in this increase was the result of increased sales volumes as a result of acquisitions in the fourth quarter of and january and colder weather in as compared to in  natural gas revenues increased million  or  to million from million in this increase was due primarily to higher wholesale prices for natural gas in partially offsetting the increase was a million reduction in revenues from chec s retail electric program which chec terminated in operating expenses central hudson the most significant elements of central hudson s operating expenses are purchased electricity and purchased natural gas 
the following reflects  as a percentage of every revenue dollar related to electric or natural gas sales  the amount expended for purchased electricity including nominal amounts spent for fuel used in electric generation and purchased natural gas for years through purchased electricity purchased natural gas central hudson negotiated multi year electricity purchase contracts with the new owners of the major generating assets it divested 
purchases under these contracts are supplemented by purchases from the nyiso and other parties 
for information regarding these electricity purchase contracts  see item properties under the subcaption load and capacity and note regulatory matters under the caption sales of major generating assets 
total utility operating expenses decreased million  or  from million in to million in purchased electricity and fuel used in electric generation decreased million due largely to the recording of amounts related to the recovery of electric supply costs via central hudson s cost recovery mechanism and an increase in volumes supplied directly by marketers to customers opting for retail access service 
other expenses of operation decreased million due primarily to a reduction in expenses for central hudson s electric reliability program and a decrease in storm restoration costs 
the electric reliability program was effectively completed in and was funded by the customer benefit fund see note regulatory matters under the subcaption rate proceedings electric and natural gas for discussion of the customer benefit fund 
partially offsetting the decrease in utility operating expenses was an increase of million in the cost of purchased natural gas 
this increase was largely driven by an increase in wholesale costs partially offset by a decrease in costs relative to volume and the recording of amounts related to the full recovery of natural gas supply costs 
total utility operating expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in purchased electricity and purchased natural gas expenses increased by a total of million due primarily to increases in the wholesale cost of these commodities 
the balance of central hudson s operating expenses increased million  reflecting a significant increase in costs related to central hudson s electric reliability and economic development programs that were funded by the customer benefit fund 
the rise in operating expenses also reflects increases in storm restoration and other electric distribution and maintenance costs  uncollectible accounts  property and other insurance costs  property taxes  and employee compensation and benefit costs 
operating expenses chec chec s operating expenses for increased million  or  from million in to million in the most significant operating expense for chec is the cost of petroleum  which increased million due primarily to higher wholesale market prices of petroleum 
this was partially offset by a decrease of million in natural gas costs due to the sale of the natural gas business unit in other operating expenses decreased million largely due to improved operating efficiencies by the fuel oil distribution subsidiaries and lower sales due to milder weather experienced in the first half of the year 
as compared to  chec s operating expenses for increased million  or  from million in to million in the cost of petroleum and natural gas increased million due primarily to an increase in sales by griffith and scasco 
the higher sales were attributable to colder weather in the first quarter of and acquisitions made in january of and in the fourth quarter of the increase in the cost of petroleum and natural gas was also due to a rise in wholesale market prices and was partially offset by the sale of scasco s natural gas business 
other operating expenses increased by million due primarily to an increase in distribution costs resulting from the increase in sales 
other income other income for energy group consolidated for  as compared to  decreased million  including a million decrease for central hudson 
the reduction in other income is due primarily to a decrease in investment income resulting from the liquidation of energy group s alternate investment program and an increase in energy group s business development costs  a reduction in central hudson interest income due to a decrease in temporary cash investments and the early settlement of a balance due to central hudson from the purchaser of its interest in the nine mile plant  and a reduction in regulatory carrying charges due from customers related to pension costs 
the alternate investment program was fully liquidated by july and the proceeds were reinvested in lower yield money market instruments and short term securities with low principal risk see note financial instruments 
the increase in business development costs reflects energy group s efforts to redeploy this available capital in suitable investment opportunities 
in central hudson s june order adopting the terms of the joint proposal see note regulatory matters under the caption rate proceedings electric and natural gas  the psc authorized the use of the customer benefit fund to offset deferred pension costs  which serves to further reduce the balance upon which carrying charges for pension costs are determined 
in  other income for energy group consolidated remained relatively flat as compared to a reduction in investment income due primarily to the liquidation of energy group s alternate investment program was largely offset by an increase of million in other income for central hudson 
the increase for central hudson was due primarily to an increase in the amortization of shareholder benefits relating to the sales of central hudson s interests in its major generating assets and an increase in the recording of carrying charges due from customers related to pension costs 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in central hudson interest income due primarily to the reasons stated above for the change in versus  and also  the effect of non recurring income recorded in that related to the sale of the stock of certain insurance companies through which central hudson provided employee benefits 
expiring amortization under a prior psc regulatory settlement related to the sales of central hudson s interests in its major generating assets  a portion of the gain recognized on those sales was recorded as other income over a four year period which commenced in and ended in amounts recorded by year  net of tax  were as follows million  million  million  and million 
energy group is seeking to use its cash reserves and debt capacity to make investments with a view to produce new earnings intended to replace  in whole or in part  the income previously provided by the sales of central hudson s interests in its major generating assets 
in this connection  energy group is actively seeking new energy related investments that provide diversification and offer attractive returns with acceptable risks 
such opportunities may include  but are not limited to  currently operating assets that use proven technology and have a relatively stable customer base such as electric generating plants and natural gas pipelines  in either case with a significant portion of their output under long term contract 
energy group also may use its cash reserves to repurchase shares of its common stock 
such repurchases  depending on the number and average price of shares repurchased  could have the effect of offsetting a substantial portion of the earnings per share impact of the expiring amortization noted above 
interest charges interest charges in  as compared to  decreased million for energy group and million for central hudson 
the reductions in interest charges were due largely to a decrease in regulatory carrying charges accrued on central hudson s declining customer benefit fund balance 
in  as compared to  interest charges decreased million and million for energy group and central hudson  respectively 
the reductions were due primarily to a decrease in regulatory carrying charges accrued on central hudson s declining customer benefit fund balance and the redemption and repurchases of higher cost long term debt 
the following table sets forth some of the pertinent data on energy group s outstanding debt this debt relates to central hudson in thousands long term debt debt retired    debt issued    outstanding at year end amount including current portion    estimated effective interest rate 
short term debt average daily amount outstanding    weighted average interest rate see note short term borrowing arrangements and note capitalization long term debt for additional information on short term and long term debt of energy group and or central hudson 
preferred stock dividends preferred stock dividends of central hudson decreased million in as compared to and million in as compared to the reductions reflect the repurchase of certain issues of preferred stock in october and may income taxes energy group s consolidated federal and state income taxes for increased million as compared to the increase reflects an increase in income taxes for central hudson of million partially offset by a reduction in income taxes for energy group the holding company  which was due to a decrease in investment income 
the increase for central hudson is due primarily to an increase in taxable income as well as an increase to flow through operating reserves 
in  as compared to  consolidated income taxes for energy group s continuing operations increased million including an increase in taxes for central hudson of million and an increase in taxes for chec of million 
the increase in income taxes for both central hudson and chec resulted largely from higher taxable income due to increased sales from colder weather and  also for chec  acquisitions made in january of and in the fourth quarter of for further information regarding income taxes  see note income tax 
nuclear operations nine mile plant for additional information regarding central hudson s sale of its ownership interest in the nine mile plant on november   see note regulatory matters under the caption sales of major generating assets 
prior to the sale of its interest in the nine mile plant in november  central hudson s share of operating expenses  taxes  and depreciation pertaining to the operation of the nine mile plant were included in energy group s financial results 
underruns in costs of operation and maintenance expenses for the nine mile plant  compared to the amount allowed in rates  were deferred for the future benefit of customers 
carrying charges are being recorded on the regulatory liability balance

retirement plan as described more fully in note post employment benefits  central hudson has a non contributory retirement income plan retirement plan covering substantially all of its employees 
the retirement plan is a defined benefit plan which provides pension benefits that are based on an employee s compensation and years of service 
the significant assumptions and estimates used to account for the pension plan are the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on retirement plan assets  the rate of compensation increase  and the method of amortizing gains and losses 
central hudson periodically confers with its actuarial consultant to determine an appropriate discount rate under applicable guidelines 
central hudson s actuarial consultant has indicated the moody s aa corporate bond yield prevailing at the valuation date  september  is appropriate for this purpose as it is the best estimate of the rate at which the benefit obligation could be settled 
such rate was as of the most recent valuation date  september  an equal weighted average of three methods was used to estimate the long run expected returns of each equity asset class in the trust fund 
the three methods were i the building block method  based on the capital asset pricing model  which states that the return of an asset class is a function of the risk free rate and a risk based return premium  ii the historical return method  which uses the historical average return for each market index as a proxy for future average returns  and iii the economic growth method  which is based on long run averages of estimates for economic growth  dividend yield  and expected inflation 
for the fixed income asset class  three methods were used the historical return and building block methods  both described above  and the market observable rate of return  represented by the average yield to maturity of representative market indices 
for the real estate asset class  the historical return and building block method  described above  were used to estimate long run expected returns 
the rate of compensation increase was based on historical and current compensation practices of central hudson giving consideration to any anticipated changes in this practice 
actuarial gains and losses  which include investment returns and demographic experience which are different than anticipated based on the actuarial assumptions  are amortized in accordance with procedures set forth by the psc which require the full gain or loss arising each year to be amortized uniformly over ten years 
the current unrecognized net losses are million  including losses for the years through therefore  the future annual amortization of these losses will increase pension expense  determined under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 entitled employers accounting for pensions  from its current level unless there are offsetting future gains or other offsetting components of pension expense 
since september   the latest measurement date  there have been no material changes in the level of retirement plan assets  the discount rate used to determine the retirement plan liabilities  or the assumptions regarding expected returns on retirement plan assets 
based on current levels of retirement plan assets and obligations  a change of one quarter percent in the long term rate of return assumption would change pension expense by  and a change of one quarter percent in the discount rate would change pension expense by approximately million 
under the policy of the psc regarding pension costs  central hudson recovers its net periodic pension costs through customer rates with differences from rate allowances deferred for future recovery from or return to customers 
as a result  central hudson fully expects to recover its net periodic pension costs over time 
the retirement plan s liquidity is primarily affected by the cash contributions made by central hudson to the plan 
central hudson contributed million to the retirement plan in and million in central hudson did not make a contribution in for additional information regarding the retirement plan  see note post employment benefits 
capital resources and liquidity cash flow both energy group s and central hudson s liquidity reflect cash flows from operating  investing  and financing activities  as shown on their respective consolidated statements of cash flows and as discussed below 
the principal factors affecting energy group s liquidity are the dividends it pays to its shareholders and  as it relates to both central hudson and chec  cash flows generated from operations  capital expenditures  and dividends paid to energy group 
central hudson s liquidity is also affected by its debt obligations 
central hudson s cash flows from operating activities reflect principally its energy deliveries and costs of operations 
the volume of energy deliveries is primarily dependent on factors external to central hudson  such as weather and economic conditions 
prices at which central hudson provides energy to its customers are determined in accordance with rate plans approved by the psc 
in general  changes in the costs of purchased electricity and purchased natural gas may affect the timing of cash flows but not overall net income  as these costs are fully recoverable through central hudson s electric and natural gas cost adjustment mechanisms 
changes in energy group s and central hudson s cash and temporary cash investments resulting from operating  investing  and financing activities for the twelve months ended december   and december   are summarized below energy group cash flow summary variance millions of dollars vs 
operating activities investing activities financing activities net change for the period balance at beginning of period balance at end of period energy group s net cash flows provided by operating activities during the twelve months ended december  were million higher as compared to cash flows increased due primarily to the receipt of a refund in for an amended utility service tax return for for central hudson  a reduction in costs related to various programs funded by the customer benefit fund notably the electric reliability program which was substantially completed by the end of  the proceeds from the sale of emissions allowances by central hudson in  and the absence of a pension contribution for central hudson 
energy group does not anticipate the recurrence in of a refund for utility service taxes for central hudson or the sale of emissions allowances that occurred in additionally  as authorized in the joint proposal approved by the psc  deferred electric pension and opeb costs as of december   including carrying charges  were offset against the customer benefit fund with no impact to cash flow for the total amount offset through december   was million 
energy group will continue to use the customer benefit fund to offset the cost of various programs as well as undercollected pension and opeb costs subject to certain limitations 
for further details see note regulatory matters under the caption rate proceedings electric and natural gas

risk factors redeployment of capital energy group is seeking to invest million in energy related assets 
these funds were generated from the sales of central hudson s interests in its major generating assets and energy group s sale of ch resources and are currently held in low risk and low return money market instruments and short term securities 
investments in new business ventures may provide returns that are not commensurate with their risk profile  including potential losses or write offs  and they may cause energy group s earnings to be more volatile 
energy group may not be successful in finding suitable new investments and  therefore  energy group may not achieve the earnings accretion such investments could produce 
no projected income from such future investments in new energy related assets has been included in any earnings guidance issued to date by energy group for storms and other events beyond central hudson s control may interfere with the operation of its transmission and distribution facilities in the mid hudson valley region central hudson s revenues are generated by the delivery of electricity over transmission and distribution lines and by the delivery of natural gas through pipelines 
these facilities  which are owned and operated by central hudson or by third party entities  are at risk of damage from storms  natural disasters  wars  terrorist acts  and other catastrophic events 
if central hudson is unable to repair its facilities in a timely manner  or if the third parties that own and operate the interconnected facilities are unable to repair their facilities in a timely manner  central hudson s customers may experience a service disruption and central hudson may experience lower revenues or increased expenses  or both  that central hudson may not be able to recover fully through rates  insurance  sales margins  or other means in a timely manner  or at all 
storms and other events beyond the control of chec s subsidiaries may interfere with the operation of their fuel oil delivery businesses in the mid atlantic and in the northeast region chec s revenues from its fuel oil delivery businesses are generated by the delivery of various petroleum products within their areas of operation 
in order to conduct these businesses  chec s subsidiaries need access to petroleum supplies from storage facilities in their service territories 
some of these storage facilities are owned or leased by chec s subsidiaries  and some are owned and operated by third party entities 
these facilities are at risk of damage from storms  natural disasters  wars  terrorist acts  and other catastrophic events and supply of petroleum products to these facilities could be delayed  curtailed  or lost due to developments in the world oil markets 
if such damage or disruption were to occur  and if the affected chec subsidiary were unable to procure petroleum from alternative sources of supply in a timely manner  the customers of such subsidiary could experience a service disruption and the subsidiary could experience lower revenues  or increased expenses  or both  that the subsidiary might not be able to recover fully through insurance  sales margins  or other means in a timely manner  or at all 
unusual temperatures in central hudson and chec s service territories could adversely impact earnings central hudson s service territory is the mid hudson valley region 
chec s subsidiaries serve the mid atlantic region and northeast us these areas typically experience seasonal fluctuations in temperature 
if  however  the regions were to experience unusually mild winters and or cooler summers  central hudson s and chec s earnings could be adversely impacted 
a considerable portion of central hudson s total electric deliveries is directly or indirectly related to weather sensitive end uses such as air conditioning and space heating 
much of the fuel oil delivered by chec s subsidiaries is also used for space heating  as is the majority of the natural gas delivered by central hudson 
as a result  sales fluctuate and vary from normal expected levels based on variations in weather from normal seasonal levels 
such variations in sales volumes could affect results of operations significantly 
central hudson and chec s subsidiaries have programs in place to constrain the potential variability in results of operations through the use of derivative instruments 
however  no assurance can be given that suitable risk management instruments will remain available 
central hudson s rate plans limit its ability to pass through increased costs to its customers  if central hudson s rate plans are modified by state regulatory authorities  central hudson revenues may be lower than expected as a transmission and distribution company delivering electricity and natural gas within new york state  central hudson is regulated by the psc  which regulates retail rates  terms and conditions of service  various business practices and transactions  financings  and transactions between central hudson and energy group or energy group s competitive business subsidiaries 
the psc s order establishing rates in central hudson s rate proceeding  which was issued on october   and became effective november   and the psc s joint proposal order issued on june   and effective july   together the rate plans cover the rates central hudson can charge customers and contain a number of related provisions 
rates charged to customers generally may not be changed during the respective limited terms of the rate plans  other than for the recovery of energy costs and limited other exceptions 
as a result  the rate plans may not reflect all of the increased construction and other costs that may be experienced after the date the rate plans became effective 
the approval of new rate plans or changes to existing rate plans including the modification or elimination of central hudson s energy cost adjustment clauses could have a significant effect on central hudson s financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
the current rate plans and material matters relating to potential rate changes are described in note regulatory matters 
the current rate plans permit central hudson to file for changes in rates any time after june   but rates are generally not changed by the psc until eleven months after the filing of proposed rate changes 
central hudson expects to file for new retail rates within the next two year period 
central hudson cannot predict the rates that will be established by the psc  or whether its business may be adversely affected by the rates determined  in such proceeding 
central hudson is subject to risks relating to asbestos litigation and manufactured gas plant facilities litigations have been commenced against central hudson arising from the use of asbestos at its previously owned major generating assets  and central hudson is involved in a number of matters arising from contamination at former manufactured gas plant sites 
reference is made to note commitments and contingencies and in particular to the subcaptions in note regarding asbestos litigation and former manufactured gas plant facilities 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the primary market risks for energy group and its subsidiaries are commodity price risk and interest rate risk 
commodity price risk  related primarily to purchases of natural gas  electricity  and petroleum products for resale  is mitigated in several different ways 
central hudson  under the settlement agreement  collects its actual purchased electricity and purchased natural gas costs through cost adjustment clauses in its rates 
these adjustment clauses provide for the collection of costs  including risk management costs  from customers to reflect the actual costs incurred in obtaining supply 
risk management costs are defined by the psc as costs associated with transactions that are intended to reduce price volatility or reduce overall costs to customers 
these costs include transaction costs  and gains and losses associated with risk management instruments 
griffith and scasco may increase the prices charged for the commodities they sell in response to changes in costs  however  the ability to raise prices is limited by the competitive market 
depending on market conditions  central hudson  griffith  and scasco enter into long term fixed supply and long term forward supply contracts for the purchase of these commodities 
central hudson also uses natural gas storage facilities  which enable it to purchase and hold quantities of natural gas at pre heating season prices for use during the heating season 
central hudson and the competitive business subsidiaries have in place an energy risk management program to manage  through the use of defined risk management practices  various risks associated with their respective operations  namely commodity price risk and sales volatility due to weather 
this risk management program permits the use of derivative financial instruments for hedging purposes and does not permit their use for trading or speculative purposes 
central hudson  griffith  and scasco have entered into either exchange traded futures contracts or over the counter otc contracts with third parties to hedge commodity price risk associated with the purchase of natural gas  electricity  and petroleum products and to hedge the effect on earnings due to significant variances in weather conditions from normal patterns 
the types of derivative instruments used include natural gas futures and basis swaps to hedge natural gas purchases  contracts for differences to hedge electricity purchases  put and call options to hedge oil purchases  and weather derivatives 
otc derivative transactions are entered into only with counter parties that meet certain credit criteria 
the creditworthiness of these counter parties is determined primarily by reference to published credit ratings 
at december   central hudson had open derivative contracts to hedge natural gas prices through october  covering approximately of central hudson s projected total natural gas requirements during this period 
in  derivative transactions were used to hedge of central hudson s total natural gas supply requirements as compared to in in its electric operations  central hudson had open derivatives at december   hedging approximately of its required electricity supply through february in  central hudson hedged approximately of its total electricity supply requirements with otc derivative contracts as compared to in in addition  central hudson has in place a number of agreements  of varying terms  to purchase electricity produced by certain of its former major generating assets and other generating facilities at fixed prices 
the notional amounts hedged by the derivatives and the electricity purchase agreements represent approximately for and  of its total anticipated electricity supply requirements in each year 
at december   griffith and scasco had open otc put and call option positions covering approximately of their combined anticipated fuel oil supply requirements for the period from january through june the percentage hedged at december   for the period january to june was 
the reduction from to was due to a change in marketing strategy which reduced the volume of fuel oil required to be hedged with derivatives 
in  derivatives were used to hedge of these requirements as compared to in derivative contracts are discussed in more detail in note summary of significant accounting policies under the subcaption accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
interest rate risk largely affects central hudson and is managed through the issuance of fixed rate debt with varying maturities and variable rate debt for which interest is reset on a periodic basis to reflect current market conditions 
the difference between costs associated with actual variable interest rates related to central hudson s bonds issued by the new york state energy research development authority and costs embedded in customer rates is deferred for eventual refund to  or recovery from  customers 
the variability in interest rates is also managed with the use of a derivative financial instrument  known as an interest rate cap agreement  for which the premium cost and any realized benefits also pass through the aforementioned regulatory recovery mechanism 
central hudson also repurchases or redeems existing debt at a lower cost when market conditions permit
