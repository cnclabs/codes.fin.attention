introduction the company s revenues and income from operations are derived principally from the operations of its telephone subsidiary  gt t 
historically  gt t derived most of its revenues from international telephone services 
in  the fcc issued a report and order setting maximum international settlement rates for telecommunications traffic between the us and other countries 
this order became effective with respect to traffic between the us and guyana on january  and required that from that date the settlement rate for traffic between the us and guyana be reduced from per minute to per minute 
the international settlement rate is the amount which gt t receives from us carriers for inbound traffic from the united states and which gt t pays to us carriers for traffic from guyana to the united states 
since the volume of inbound traffic from the united states to guyana is traditionally times the volume of outbound traffic from guyana to the united states  the reduction in the international settlement rate for us guyana traffic negatively impacted gt t s operating profits 
the lowering of the us international settlement rate in has been followed by a gradual reduction in settlement rates between guyana and most other countries to per minute or less 
during  the government of guyana announced its intention to introduce competition into guyana s telecommunications sector 
we believe that the introduction of wireline based competition would require the termination of the monopoly provisions of gt t s license  and thus would require appropriate compensation to gt t and a rebalancing of rates so that the rates for each service represent the real economic cost of such services 
we also believe that the government is considering a shifting from rate of return regulation to incentive rate cap regulation 
in february  gt t began negotiations with the government on these issues and all other outstanding issues between gt t and the government  however negotiations languished in the second quarter of in  atn and gt t brought suit in the us district court in washington  us against the inter american development bank iadb to halt a proposed loan to the government of guyana on the ground that the american director of the iadb is prohibited from approving loans to a country which has nullified the contractual rights of a us investor 
on march   the united states district court for the district of columbia dismissed the company s suit against the iadb concluding that we lacked standing 
we decided not to appeal the decision 
in march  the government invited the company to resume negotiations 
subsequently the government changed its outside counsel and sustained negotiations have not been held since 
we are unable at this time to assess the impact of the government s proposals on the future financial position or results of operations of the company 
the principal components of operating expenses for the company s telephone operations are plant specific operations expenses  plant non specific operations expenses  customer operations expenses  corporate operations 
table of contents expenses  international long distance expenses  taxes other than income taxes and general and administrative expenses 
these categories are consistent with fcc accounting practices 
plant specific operations expenses relate to support and maintenance of telephone plant and equipment and include vehicle expense  land and building expense  central office switching expense and cable and wire expense 
plant non specific operations expenses consist of depreciation charges for telephone plant and equipment and expenses related to telephone plant and network administration  engineering  power  materials and supplies  provisioning and plant network testing 
customer operations expenses relate to marketing  providing operator services for call completion and directory assistance  and establishing and servicing customer accounts 
corporate operations expenses include gt t s expenses for executive management and administration  corporate planning  accounting and finance  external relations  personnel  labor relations  data processing  legal services  procurement and general insurance 
international long distance expenses consist principally of charges from international carriers for outbound international calls from guyana and payments to audio text providers from whom gt t derives international audio text traffic 
taxes other than income taxes include gross receipts taxes  property taxes  and other miscellaneous taxes 
general and administrative expenses consist principally of parent company overheads and depreciation 
other operations  as presented throughout this document  are comprised of the operating results of choice  atc and cht 
the company s consolidated financial statements include  in addition to gt t  the subsidiaries and affiliates listed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
recent developments during the fourth quarter of  faced with continuing losses and a general lack of prospects  we curtailed the collect calling operations of our cht subsidiary 
cht plans on re orientating its equipment  personnel and international connections towards providing international wholesale transport of telecommunications traffic 
cht has minimal assets and has had an insignificant effect on the company s net income in recent years  and we do not expect cht to have a significant effect on our consolidated operating results in in early  we also curtailed atc s call center operations  and we are examining a variety of strategic solutions including a possible sale  long term lease or closure of the call center business 
while atc has the capability to employ call center agents  a lack of customer contracts and revenues have caused the business to operate well below its capacity 
the default in the fourth quarter of by atc s wholesale customer also led us to record a million impairment charge during that period 
as noted below  recent flooding in guyana has also adversely impacted atc s operations in on january  we filed a current report on form k indicating that our guyana operations had been affected by severe flooding caused by persistent rains in the area over a period of approximately ten days 
both our gt t and atc subsidiaries were affected 
estimated damages caused by the flooding are in excess of  while both companies have insurance policies that should cover the related flood damage  deductibles of up to  may apply and there is no certainty that costs incurred to mitigate flood damage will be covered by the insurers 
atc s operations in the first quarter of are expected to suffer losses due to lost revenue and some property damage  while the flooding is not expected to have a material adverse impact on gt t s results  or the company s consolidated results  for the first quarter of on march  we filed a current report on form k announcing that the current general manager and ceo of its subsidiary gt t  ms 
sonita jagan  resigned effective june  ms 
jagan has been with gt t for the last years holding various positions of increasing responsibility and is leaving to join her husband in romania 
ms 
jagan will be replaced by mr 
joseph singh  whose past positions include major general of the army of guyana  and most recently  executive director of conservation international guyana 

table of contents critical accounting policies the company has based its discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the company periodically evaluates its critical accounting policies and estimates  including those related to foreign currency  revenue recognition  valuation of accounts receivable  property  plant and equipment  long lived and intangible assets  tax related accruals and contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on operating experience and on various conditions existing in the market and it believes them to be reasonable under the circumstances 
those estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the critical accounting estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the assumptions or estimates we have selected have the potential of materially impacting our financial statements 
foreign currency 
from the inception of gt t s operations through december   a significant portion of gt t s cash receipts and expenditures have been in us dollars or other hard currencies 
accordingly  the us dollar has been gt t s functional currency and any transaction gains and losses on non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities are reflected in income 
late in and early  the value of the guyana dollar declined in relation to the us dollar  resulting in foreign exchange gains 
while the decline in rates did not have a significant impact on the company s revenues or operating expenses  the decline has offset growth in gt t s local exchange and outbound international long distance revenues  which are billed and paid in guyana dollars 
further declines in the value of the guyana dollar may have an adverse impact on the company s future operating results as growth of local currency denominated revenues continues 
as of december   million of the company s million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents was in guyana dollars 
with the decline in international settlement rates  the expansion of gt t s cellular business and the increases that gt t has received and hopes to receive in its rates for local service  the guyana dollar may become gt t s functional currency in the future 
revenue recognition 
local exchange service and international long distance revenues are recognized when earned  regardless of the period in which they are billed 
gt t determines the country of origin of traffic it receives from foreign carriers to apply the appropriate rate to minutes of long distance traffic carried by it 
in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognize for a particular carrier or transaction  gt t applies the criteria established by staff of accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition sab and defers those items that do not meet the recognition criteria and also relies on its past history of disputes and collections with each carrier in estimating amounts for which revenue is not recognized 
however  due to the nature and timing of carrier settlements  adjustments affecting revenue can and do occur in periods subsequent to the period when the services were provided  billed and recorded as revenue 
historically  our accounts receivable and revenue reserves have been sufficient to absorb any credits and bad debt write offs recorded in subsequent periods 
gt t operates in a regulated industry  therefore its pricing is subject to regulatory commission oversight 
such oversight could result in changes to the amount it bills customers in current and future periods 
the company recognizes revenue from subscriptions to choice communications internet  cable television  paging and other services monthly  as the services are provided  net of management s best estimate of uncollectible accounts 
revenues at cht and atc are not material and are not expected to be material in future periods 
revenues from the services provided by these companies are recognized when provided 
the company s subsidiary  gt t  charges an activation fee to new cellular subscribers in guyana and re activation fees to subscribers in guyana who allow their accounts to lapse 
the company determined that the activation fees do not represent a separate unit of accounting under eitf accordingly  the company s 
table of contents policy is to defer those fees and recognize them ratably over the estimated customer relationship period in accordance with sab to date  those fees have been immaterial to both gt t s and the company s financial position and results of operations for all periods presented 
installation fees charged by choice communications to customers subscribing to cable and internet services have also historically been immaterial to both choice s and the company s financial position and results of operations 
the installation fee is intended to recover a portion of the costs associated with the installation of cabling and related equipment at the customer location required for that customer to receive choice s monthly service offerings 
the company determined that the activation fees represent a separate unit of accounting under eitf as such  the company s policy is to recognize these fees as revenue when the services are performed 
valuation of accounts receivable 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when assessing the ultimate realization of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of customers 
the company establishes and maintains reserves for sales that do not meet the recognition criteria established by sab  possible unreported or uncollectible minutes from foreign carriers and doubtful accounts from customers 
due to the nature and timing of carrier settlements  adjustments affecting revenue and the corresponding receivable can and do occur in periods subsequent to the period when the services were provided  billed and recorded as revenue 
historically  our accounts receivable and revenue reserves have been sufficient to absorb any credits and bad debt write offs recorded in subsequent periods 
however  the amounts the company will ultimately realize upon settlement could differ in the near term from the amounts assumed in estimating these revenues and the related accounts receivable 
for example  increasing our estimate of uncollectible accounts from approximately to would decrease the company s consolidated revenues by approximately  per year 
property  plant and equipment 
the company operates in an environment where rapid changes in technology or changes in the intended use of property  plant and equipment may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change 
the company provides for depreciation using the straight line method 
no gain or loss is recognized in connection with ordinary retirements of depreciable property 
with regard to gt t  as of january   we adopted new and generally shorter lives in connection with a tariff application filed on december  with the guyana public utilities commission 
in february  the puc accepted these lives for purposes of setting interim rates without expressly approving them  and ordered gt t not to change its depreciation rates in the future without the approval of the puc 
because gt t operates in a regulated environment  it accounts for costs in accordance with the accounting principles for regulated enterprises 
accordingly  fixed assets are depreciated over lives approved by regulators  and certain costs and obligations are deferred based on approvals received from regulators to permit recovery of such amounts in future years 
long lived and intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets  including property and equipment  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss exists when estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets are less than their carrying amount 
if an asset is deemed to be impaired  the amount of the impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the asset s carrying value as compared to its estimated fair value  based on management s assumptions and projections 
we assessed our long lived assets for impairment during  and determined that an impairment charge of million was required to write down the carrying amount of certain assets to their estimated fair value as these assets were identified as being excess  obsolete or carried at values that may not be recoverable due to an adverse change in the extent to which these assets were being utilized in the business  which was caused by the unfavorable business climate within the industry and continued losses in each segment 
we also assess the carrying value of goodwill on an annual basis in accordance to sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
the carrying value of each reporting unit  including goodwill assigned to that 
table of contents reporting unit  is compared to its fair value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit  including goodwill  an analysis is performed to determine if an impairment charge should be recorded 
we recorded a million impairment charge for goodwill at choice during our estimates of the future cash flows attributable to our long lived assets and the fair value of our businesses involve significant uncertainty 
those estimates are based on management s assumptions of future results  growth trends and industry conditions 
if those estimates are not met  we could have additional impairment charges in the future  and the amounts may be material in june  the fasb approved sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes accounting standards for recognition and measurement of a liability for an asset retirement obligation and the associated asset retirement cost 
the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated retirement costs are capitalized and included as part of the carrying value of the long lived asset and depreciated over the useful life of the asset 
sfas no 
was effective for the company beginning on january  in the case of gt t we have not provided for costs related to the removal of tangible long lived assets because there are no obligations under any of our leases or under any existing or enacted laws  statutes or ordinances or elsewhere that would require us to provide for costs related to the retirement of those assets 
in the case of our other businesses  principally choice communications  we lease tower space from third parties 
while we have obligations under certain leases to remove equipment placed on these towers failure to remove the equipment would result in the landlord retaining possession of such equipment and selling or otherwise disposing of it with no further obligation to choice  the costs associated with removal are immaterial to our business and have not been provided for in our financial statements 
we periodically review our obligations and update our cost estimates 
if laws are enacted or circumstances change  amounts required to remediate the properties may differ significantly from the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
tax related accruals 
our estimate of deferred and current income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred assets and liabilities are shown in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in this report 
these reflect the assessment of actual current and future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements  giving consideration to both timing and probability of realization 
actual income tax could vary from these estimates due to future changes in tax law 
the company is also subject to tax audits from various jurisdictions  particularly in guyana 
it makes estimates based on the available information and consults with experts where necessary 
the company believes its estimates are reasonable  however  they may change materially in the future due to new developments or interpretation 
contingencies 
we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits  audits and other claims related to lawsuits and other legal and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of loss accrual required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
we consult with legal counsel and other experts where necessary in connection with our assessment of any contingencies 
the required accrual for any such contingency may change materially in the future due to new developments or changes in each matter 
we estimate these contingencies amount to approximately million at december   the majority of which are not recorded on our books 
adverse developments in these matters may result in the recording of liabilities to satisfy all or a portion of these claims

results of operations years ended december  and net income for the year ended december  was million  or per share basic and diluted  as compared to million  or per share basic and per share diluted for  a decrease of 
table of contents million or 
net income for was reduced by the recording in the third and fourth quarter of several significant impairment and other charges totaling approximately million 
the impact of these charges was partly offset by some large carrier settlements we recognized on a cash basis and a foreign exchange gain  which together increased net income by approximately million 
telephone operations 
telephone operating revenues for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for  an increase of million or 
international long distance revenues increased by resulting from an increase in international traffic 
approximately million of this increase relates to the receipt of amounts owed to gt t from several large international carriers that were significantly past due and were recognized on a cash basis 
gt t received million in such settlements during the latter part of as compared to  received in the fourth quarter of excluding the effect of these settlements  telephone operating revenues grew by and international long distance revenue grew by 
the increase in international traffic during primarily reflects increased lines and cellular subscribers in service 
unlike gt t s inbound international traffic  outbound international traffic  which amounted to approximately of gt t s international traffic in  is billed and paid in local currency and therefore revenue for this traffic was negatively impacted by the decline in value of the guyana dollar in in addition  termination rates for both inbound and outbound calls between guyana and countries other than the united states continued to decline towards us levels  which we believe contributed to the increase in traffic volumes in see business gt t international traffic 
local exchange service revenues were million  down slightly from the million reported in gt t s subscriber growth led to an increase in local exchange revenues in local currency  but the decline in the value of the guyana dollar in offset growth in this category 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s included in this report 
the number of gt t s cellular subscribers increased from approximately  at december  to approximately  at december  and gt t s wireline subscribers access lines increased by during to approximately  lines in service at the end of the year 
the growth in access lines in mainly reflects the successful completion of the planned rollout of service to new areas of guyana 
on the cellular side  gt t was able to expand its capacity and also commenced offering gsm gprs services and handsets during the fourth quarter of however  given the launch in late of a new cellular services competitor and gt t s increased penetration of the market  gt t s cellular subscriber base is unlikely to grow as rapidly in and may  in fact  decline 
despite the growth in total telephone operating revenue  total telephone operating expenses  which consists of telephone operating expenses  international long distance expenses and general and administrative expenses at gt t and the parent company  declined by approximately  or to million for from million for due to cuts in international long distance expenses and the positive impact of the decline in value of the guyana dollar on gt t s local currency expenses 
international long distance expenses declined by million or due to more efficient routing of outbound traffic lowering average outbound termination rates 
general and administrative expenses  which consist mainly of overhead expense of the parent company  were million and essentially unchanged from levels 
general and administrative expenses during benefited from decreased salary and bonus expense  lower travel expenditures  and the shifting of certain parent company headquarters personnel to focus primarily on choice  reallocating the related salary expense to other operations 
these reductions were offset by charges of  related to a reduction in the carrying value of certain assets at atn  and the settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of additionally  we experienced an increase in professional fees  primarily related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of we expect the cost of compliance with the sarbanes oxley act to increase significantly in and telephone operating expenses  which includes depreciation  increased by million or compared to levels due to the large increase in gt t s lines and cellular subscribers 
income from telephone operations was million for the year ended december  as compared to million and for the corresponding period of this represents an increase of nearly 

table of contents other operations 
other operations reflects the combined operating results of choice communications  cht  and atc 
losses from other operations were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for  as both choice million and atc million recorded impairment losses  discussed below  and revenue growth at these business units did not keep pace with expenditures 
in  we expect the losses from atc to be significantly lower than  and we expect choice s losses to decline more modestly 
revenues from other operations increased by to million for as compared to million for the growth in revenues was primarily attributable to choice communications  which reported an increase of approximately  or compared to levels 
choice s cable television revenues increased nearly to approximately million in on a increase in subscribers and the sale of more premium service packages 
however  growth in television revenues was partially offset by an decline in choice s other revenues  mainly due to attrition in choice s dial up internet base 
revenues from atlantic tele center increased by  over levels due to the completion of a wholesale arrangement with another call center company during the third quarter of  improved collections experience and revenues from atlantic tele satellite ats 
revenues from call home telecom were not significant in either or the increased loss from other operations was primarily due to increased expenses at choice of million attributable to increased depreciation and compensation expenses and tv programming costs 
the increase in these items reflects choice s additional investment in plant and strong growth in tv subscribers 
we concluded that the goodwill on choice s balance sheet was impaired and recorded a charge for million in the fourth quarter of choice also recorded a  charge in the third quarter of to write off non productive assets 
atc s wholesale arrangement  combined with better expense management  contributed to a  reduction in call center losses  before impairment charges  during  an improvement of when compared to levels 
these savings were partly offset by losses associated with the ats satellite internet business of  atc s wholesale customer defaulted during the fourth quarter of as a result of the default  we are considering strategic alternatives  including the sale or closure of the facility  and based on the default  we concluded that atc s call center assets were impaired at december   and recorded a charge of million against the million of these assets on our books 
the flooding in guyana in january  which caused substantial damage to the main facility  further impacted atc s operations 
as to cht  given the very small size of its collect calling business and lack of prospects for growth  we have decided to curtail cht s collect calling operations and expect to redeploy its assets to support the wholesale transport of telecommunications traffic 
other income expense 
equity in the earnings of bermuda digital communications  a cellular operator in bermuda  was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for  an increase of 
the increase in equity in earnings of bdc for primarily reflects higher airtime  long distance  and roaming revenues 
an increase in subscribers from  at december  to  also contributed to the revenue increase 
in addition  bdc entered into roaming agreements in late and early with the two largest us cdma carriers  along with certain other carriers  and these agreements helped drive the increase in long distance and roaming revenues  from both bdc s subscribers traveling abroad and visitors to bermuda 
while it may be difficult for bdc to achieve similar substantial growth in because of competition and the limited size of their market  we are hopeful that bdc s new high speed data services will provide a significant additional revenue stream in and beyond 
see business bdc 
other income expense  excluding the effect of the company s equity in earnings of bdc  includes foreign exchange gains and losses incurred by the company on our foreign operations  interest income  interest expense  management fees earned from bdc and other non operating items 
other income was million for the year ended december  and  for the results reflect foreign exchange gains recorded by the company of  for  as compared to foreign exchange gains of  for the improvement in resulted from a decline in the value of the guyana dollar in relation to the us dollar  which decreased the value of gt t s guyana dollar denominated net liabilities and resulted in a non cash gain

management fees received from bdc  which are based on bdc s revenue  were million in compared to  in reflecting continued growth in bdc s business 
other income expense in also includes a charge of  related to the write off of loans made in connection with our investment in lightrade  inc  as compared to a total charge of  during to write down certain assets at atn 
excluding bdc  other income is likely to decline in if there are no foreign exchange gains our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was as compared to for the increase in the effective tax rate during was primarily due to the recording of approximately million in non cash charges related to the write down of assets for which there was no associated tax benefit

international long distance revenues increased by million or on greater traffic volumes but lower revenue per minute 
the increase in international traffic in primarily reflects increased lines and cellular subscribers in service 
throughout  termination rates for both inbound and outbound calls between guyana and countries other than the united states declined towards us levels 
in addition to lowering average revenue per minute for inbound calls and average cost per minute for outbound calls  this worldwide price decline likely contributed to the increase in traffic volumes in see business gt t international traffic 
operating expenses were million for as compared to million for  an increase of  or  as increases in telephone operating expenses and general and administrative expenses were partially offset by a substantial reduction in international long distance expenses 
telephone operating expenses increased million or primarily due to increased costs of servicing a larger cellular and wireline subscriber base  as well as an increase in the cost of utilities and personnel 
general and administrative expenses increased  or during primarily due to increased advertising  printing costs associated with directories  and personnel costs 
the million reduction in international long distance expenses was due to lower average outbound termination rates 
losses from other operations were million for as compared to million for revenues of these operations increased to million for as compared to million for  an increase of 
the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to increased revenues from choice communications  as cable tv revenues increased over to approximately million due to a increase in subscribers and the sale of more premium service packages 
this increase in revenue was partially offset by declines in revenue at call home telecom and atlantic tele center due to poor collections experience 
expenses of other operations were million for as compared to million for  an increase of 
this increase in expenses was primarily due to increases in costs incurred at choice communications and cht  which were partially offset by reduced expenses at atc 

table of contents other income was million for compared to million in  an increase of 
the increase was primarily attributable to net foreign exchange gains of  in as compared to a net loss of  in the improvement resulted from a decline in the value of the guyana dollar in relation to the us dollar late in  which decreased the value of gt t s guyana dollar net liabilities resulting in a gain 
however  this gain was substantially offset by losses incurred during the year selling guyana dollars at rates below the central bank exchange rate quoted by the bank of guyana 
interest expense declined by  due to a lower variable rate of interest on our outstanding debt and a reduction in the principal balance outstanding 
interest income declined by  consistent with the decline in interest rates during the company s effective tax rate for the year ended december  was as compared to for regulatory and tax issues the company is involved in a number of regulatory and tax proceedings 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in this report 
a material and adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and future operations 
liquidity and capital resources the following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual obligations as of december  and the periods in which payments are due contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in millions long term debt including interest operating lease obligations as of december   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents as noted on the company s consolidated balance sheet and statement of cash flows 
this represents an increase of million compared to december  cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to in the principal uses of cash in were million for capital equipment  million for the purchase of marketable securities  million for dividends paid to shareholders of the company s common stock  million for distributions to minority shareholders  and million for principal reduction on long term debt 
on october   the company obtained a million credit facility that allows for borrowings of up to million for external acquisitions and investments  million for general corporate purposes  and a  revolving line of credit 
the interest rate on the facility is libor plus 
the facility is collateralized by  among other things  a pledge of all the gt t stock owned by atn  atn s right to management fees from its subsidiaries and affiliates and the assets of choice 
as of december  the company had drawn million under this facility 
during  atn entered into two separate financing arrangements with us bancorp equipment finance  inc these loans are collateralized by property of atn and its subsidiaries 
as of december   approximately  and million were outstanding on these loans 
the loans mature in and interest is payable on the outstanding principal balance at a variable rate based on three month libor plus and  respectively  but there are penalties for prepayment 
as of december  the interest rates on these loans were and  respectively 
towards the end of and continuing in early  we invested a large portion of our cash balances into highly rated debt instruments and other securities 
investments in these items will generally be recorded as marketable securities on our balance sheet 
while we believe this is a prudent way to increase returns on our 
table of contents cash  these investments carry more risk to principal than bank money market accounts due to the possibility of adverse market changes or negative developments involving the issuer of any such instruments 
we try to minimize these risks by generally seeking instruments with shorter maturities issued by highly rated government agencies or corporations  but there is no way to eliminate the risk to principal 
we believe our existing cash balances and other capital resources  including the remaining amounts available under the million credit facility  are adequate to meet our current operating and capital needs 
our primary sources of funds at the parent company level are advisory fees and dividends from gt t and bdc 
the tax and regulatory issues discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report could have a material adverse impact on the company s liquidity 
neither gt t nor bdc is subject to any contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends 
the continued expansion of gt t s network is dependent upon the ability of gt t to purchase equipment with us dollars 
a portion of gt t s taxes in guyana may be payable in us dollars or other hard currencies 
as a result of the rate increases previously awarded to and currently sought by gt t  the growth of gt t s local exchange operations and the general trend toward lower international settlement rates  it is likely that an increasing portion of the company s revenues will be earned in guyana currency 
while there are no legal restrictions on the conversion of guyana currency into us dollars or other hard currencies  or on the expatriation of guyana currency or foreign currency from guyana  there are risks associated with the conversion of guyana dollars to us dollars due to limited liquidity in the guyana foreign currency markets 
the limited liquidity has not prevented us from converting guyana currency into us dollars within a given three month period or from converting at a price that reasonably approximates the reported exchange rate 
while the company believes that it has  and will continue to have  adequate cash flows denominated in hard currency to meet its current operating  debt service and capital requirements  there can be no assurance that gt t will be able to convert its guyana currency earnings into the hard currency needed to meet such obligations 
as of december   approximately million of the company s million total cash balance consisted of balances held in guyana dollars 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk from time to time we explore opportunities to acquire communications properties or licenses in the caribbean  latin america  the united states and elsewhere 
such acquisitions may require external financing 
while there can be no assurance as to whether  when or on what terms we will be able to acquire any such businesses or licenses  such acquisitions may be accomplished through the issuance of shares  payment of cash or debt 
the company anticipates making capital expenditures on existing businesses of approximately to million during fiscal  for  among other things  gt t wireline expansion  including new switches and cabling  increasing gt t s cellular capacity and enhancing coverage in urban areas  and coverage and service expansion at choice communications 
the company also expects that bridge international communications will draw down additional amounts on its secured credit facility with the company 
as of march  bridge had drawn down an additional  under the facility during the first quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report

table of contents supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the company expects to adopt sfas no 
r on july  sfas no 
r permits the company to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the january  adoption date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after january  and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to january  that remain unvested on the adoption date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the company plans to adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by sfas no 
 the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost on grants of employee stock options 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income loss and earnings loss share in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement is not anticipated to be material since the company does not currently recognize a benefit of excess tax deductions because of federal and state net operating loss carry forwards available to offset future us federal and state taxable income 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
r to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk although a significant portion of gt t s revenues and expenditures are currently transacted in us dollars  the results of future operations nevertheless may be affected by changes in the value of the guyana dollar 
from february until early  the guyana dollar remained relatively stable at the rate of approximately to the us dollar 
in the guyana dollar declined in value to approximately to the us dollar 
it remained relatively stable at approximately that rate through from december   through december  the guyana dollar further declined in value to approximately to the us dollar and it remained relatively stable until late in the fourth quarter  the guyana dollar declined in value to approximately to the us dollar and to approximately during the first quarter of the effect of the devaluation of the guyana dollar on the company s consolidated financial results has not been significant in the periods presented 
however  the recent declines in and resulted in the recording of a million foreign exchange gain at december  and a  gain in the first quarter of as the devaluation decreased the value of gt t s guyana dollar net liabilities resulting in a gain 
the gain in was substantially offset by other foreign exchange losses incurred during the year  the company did not incur similar losses in a substantial majority of the company s consolidated cash balances are kept in us dollar denominated short term investments  and gt t generally endeavors to maintain a balance between its guyana dollar cash 
table of contents deposits and local receivables which are denominated in guyana dollars  and its local tax and other payables which are also denominated in the guyana dollar 
under generally accepted international accounting principles  which  in the company s view  are statutorily applicable to the rate making process in guyana  gt t s functional currency has been the us dollar because a significant portion of gt t s revenues and expenditures have been transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  in the company s view  gt t is currently entitled to its agreed upon minimum return on rate base computed in us dollars on a us dollar historical cost rate base and therefore devaluations of the guyana dollar should have had no long term impact on the value of gt t s earnings in us dollars 
the guyana public utility commission has neither approved nor disapproved this position of the company 
moreover  with the decline in international settlement rates and the increases that gt t hopes to have in local revenue  the guyana dollar may become gt t s functional currency at some time in the future 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies above 
the company has approximately million of long term debt at december  the interest rates associated with this debt are variable and subject to change with the market 
an increase in rates will increase the company s cost of borrowing and have a negative impact on our earnings
