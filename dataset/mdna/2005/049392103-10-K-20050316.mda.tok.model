ebitda means income before net interest expense  income taxes and depreciation and amortization and other non cash items such as compensation expenses associated with unit issuances to employees of the general partner and directors 
ebitda is not intended to represent cash flow and does not represent the measure of cash available for distribution 
our method of computing ebitda may not be the same method used to compute similar measures reported by other companies  or ebitda may be computed differently by us in different contexts ie  public reporting versus computation under financing agreements 
certain items excluded from ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing a company s financial performance  such as a company s cost of capital and its tax structure  as well as historic costs of depreciable assets 
we have included information concerning ebitda because ebitda provides investors and management with additional information as to our ability to pay our fixed charges and is presented solely as a supplemental financial measure 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to  or more meaningful than  net income or cash flow as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity

we undertake no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to forward looking statements which we may make to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this form k or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
the following information is provided to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
general our principal business objective is to generate income for distribution to our unitholders 
our business is conducted in the midstream natural gas industry and we are active in the appalachian and mid continent areas of the united states  specifically  pennsylvania  ohio  new york  oklahoma and texas 
in appalachia  we gather approximately million cubic feet of gas per day through our pipeline system from more than  wells for delivery to a variety of customers on major intra or interstate pipeline systems and a limited number of direct end users 
this transported gas is primarily controlled by atlas america  inc  the parent company of our general partner 
our mid continent operations began in july upon our acquisition of spectrum field services  inc in the mid continent  we purchase approximately million cubic feet of gas per day under more than separate gas purchase contracts 
this gas is then transported to our velma  oklahoma gas processing facility where the natural gas liquids  or ngls  along with various impurities are removed 
the remaining pipeline quality gas is then delivered into a major intrastate pipeline system where it is sold at market prices 
the ngls are similarly delivered into a separate major intrastate pipeline system where they are also sold for a price determined by the value of the actual components of that liquid stream  for example  ethane  butane  propane etc 
fee arrangements in appalachia  substantially all of the gas we transport is for atlas america under a pop contract where we earn a fee equal to a percentage  generally of the selling price of the gas subject  in most cases to a minimum of 
or 
per mcf 
since our inception in january  our transportation fee has always exceeded this minimum 
the balance of the appalachian gas we transport is for third party operators generally under fee contracts 
our revenues in mid continent are determined primarily by the fees aplmc earns from the following two types of arrangements fee based contracts 
we receive a set fee for gathering and processing raw natural gas 
our revenue is a function of the volume of gas that we gather and process and is not directly dependent on the value of that gas 
percent of proceeds or pop contracts these contracts provide for us to retain a negotiated percentage of the residue natural gas and ngls resulting from our gathering and processing operations with the remainder being remitted to the producer 
in this situation  we and the producer are directly dependent on the volume of the commodity and its value we own a percentage of that commodity and are directly subject to its ultimate market value 
unlike many of our competitors  we have no keep whole contracts where the producer has the right to receive of the thermal value of its produced raw natural gas based on the value of the processed and delivered pipeline quality residue natural gas 
this type of contract exposes the processing company to frac spread risk the difference between the value of the ngl extracted from processing and the thermal value equivalent of the residue natural gas 
in the mid continent  approximately of our volumes and revenues are derived from pop contracts 
the percentage of the proceeds that we retain is negotiated and can vary greatly depending on a variety of factors and circumstances 
based on historical trends  we generally expect ngl prices to follow changes in crude oil prices over the long term  which we believe will in large part be determined by the level of production from major crude oil exporting countries and the demand generated by growth in the world economy 
we believe that future natural gas prices will be influenced by supply deliverability  the severity of winter and summer weather and the level of united states economic growth 
the number of active oil and gas rigs has increased in the past year  mainly due to recent significant increases in natural gas prices  which could result in sustained increases in drilling activity during however  energy market uncertainty could negatively impact north american drilling activity in the short term 
lower drilling levels over a sustained period would have a negative effect on natural gas volumes gathered and processed 
we closely monitor the risks associated with these commodity price changes on our future operations and  where appropriate  use various commodity instruments such as natural gas  crude oil and ngl contracts to hedge a portion of the value of our assets and operations from such price risks 
we do not realize the full impact of commodity price changes because some of our sales volumes were previously hedged at prices different than actual market prices 
the recognition in our consolidated statements of income of the cumulative changes in the fair value of these hedge instruments reduced our results of operations by  in the year ended december  see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 
the remaining term over which we are currently hedging our exposure to the variability of future cash flows is through the end of spectrum acquisition on july   we acquired spectrum field services  inc  which we refer to as spectrum  mid continent or aplmc  for approximately million  including the payment of taxes due as a result of the transaction 
this acquisition significantly increased our size and diversified the natural gas supply basins in which we operate and the natural gas midstream services we provide to our customers 
we expect the spectrum acquisition to be accretive to our cash distributions per common unit 
we financed the spectrum acquisition  including approximately million of transaction costs  as follows o borrowing million under the term loan portion of our new million senior secured term loan and revolving credit facility administered by wachovia bank  national association  o using the million of net proceeds received from the sale to resource america  inc and atlas america  inc 
of preferred units in our operating subsidiary atlas pipeline operating partnership  lp  and o using million of the net proceeds from our april common unit offering 
in july  we completed a public offering of  common units of limited partner interest whose net proceeds after underwriting discounts and commissions and costs were million 
we used a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to repay million of the borrowings under our new credit facility and to repurchase the preferred units from resource america and atlas america 
the acquisition of spectrum significantly changed our financial position and results of operations 
at december   we had an available borrowing capacity million 
we intend to finance our growth with a combination of long term debt and equity to maintain our financial flexibility to fund future opportunities 
settlement of alaska pipeline company arbitration in september  we entered into an agreement with semco energy  inc to purchase all of the stock of alaska pipeline company 
in order to complete the acquisition  we needed the approval of the regulatory commission of alaska 
the regulatory commission initially approved the transaction  but on june  it vacated its order of approval based upon a motion for clarification or reconsideration filed by semco 
on july   semco sent atlas pipeline a notice purporting to terminate the transaction 
we pursued our remedies under the acquisition agreement 
on december   we entered into a settlement agreement with semco settling all issues and matters related to semco s termination of the sale of alaska pipeline company to us and semco paid us million 
in connection with the termination and settlement of the legal action  we incurred costs of approximately million 
in addition  we also incurred million of costs associated with the acquisition of semco 
these proceeds and costs are shown as gain on arbitration settlement  net on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  recent developments on march   we entered into an agreement with lg pl  llc  a texas limited liability company  and la grange acquisition  lp  a texas limited partnership  both subsidiaries of energy transfer partners  lp nyse etp  to acquire all of the outstanding equity interests in etc oklahoma pipeline  ltd  a texas limited partnership 
etc oklahoma pipeline s principal assets include more than miles of natural gas pipelines located in the anadarko basin in western oklahoma  a natural gas processing facility in elk city  oklahoma and a gas treatment plant in prentiss  oklahoma 
the total consideration will be approximately million in cash 
the purchase price is subject to post closing adjustment based on gas imbalances  certain prepaid costs and expenses and capital expenditures  and title defects  if any 
consummation of the acquisition is conditioned on the receipt of various approvals  including hart scott rodino act approval or early termination of the application waiting period  and other customary closing conditions 
we have received a commitment from wachovia bank  national association and bank of america  na to arrange the syndication of a million loan facility 
the facility will be comprised of a million year revolving loan and a million year term loan 
up to million of the facility may be used for standby letters of credit 
borrowings under the facility will be secured by a lien on and security interest in all of our property and that of our subsidiaries and by the guaranty of each of our subsidiaries 
the loan proceeds will be used to refinance our existing million facility and to finance the acquisition of etc oklahoma pipeline 
results of operations in the years ended december   and  our principal revenues came from the operation of our pipeline gathering systems which transport  process and compress natural gas 
two variables which affect our transportation revenues are o the volumes of natural gas transported by us which  in turn  depend upon the number of wells connected to our gathering system  the amount of natural gas they produce  and the demand for that natural gas  and o the transportation fees paid to us which  in turn  depend upon the price of the natural gas we transport  which itself are a function of the relevant supply and demand in the mid atlantic and northeastern areas of the united states 
we set forth the average volumes we transported  our average gross margin rate per mcf and average transportation rates per mcf and revenues received by us for the periods indicated in the following table for the years ended december  dollars in thousands  except per mcf data average daily throughput volumes in mcf mid continent  average daily throughput volumes in mcf appalachia    total average daily throughput volumes in mcf    average gross margin rate per mcf mid continent average transportation rate per mcf appalachia 


total natural gas and liquids gross margin mid continent  total transportation and compression revenues appalachia 
   gross margin calculated as natural gas and liquids revenue less natural gas and liquids costs 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
our natural gas and liquid revenues are associated with our acquisition of spectrum on july  these revenues reflect five and one half months of operations in the current year 
we anticipate that these revenues will increase in our transportation and compression revenues increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this increase of million consisted of an increase in the average transportation rate paid to us million and an increase in the volumes of natural gas we transported 
our transportation rate was 
per mcf in the year ended december  as compared to 
per mcf in the year ended december   an increase of 
per mcf 
during the year ended december   natural gas prices increased significantly over the year ended december  since our transportation rates are generally at fixed percentages of the sale prices of the natural gas we transport  the higher prices resulted in an increase in our average transportation rate 
our average daily throughput volumes in appalachia were  mcfs in the year ended december  as compared to  mcfs in the year ended december   an increase of mcfs 
the increase in the average daily throughput volume resulted principally from volumes associated with new wells added to our pipeline system  we turned on line and wells in the years ended december  and  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by the natural decline in production volumes from existing wells connected to our gathering systems 
our gain on arbitration settlement  net is the result of a december  settlement agreement with semco settling all issues and matters related to semco s termination of the sale of alaska pipeline company to us 
semco paid us million  which is shown net of million of arbitration costs and million of acquisition costs 
costs and expenses 
our natural gas and ngl and plant operating expenses are associated with our acquisition of spectrum on july  these expenses reflect five and one half months of operations in the current year 
we anticipate that these expenses will increase in our transportation and compression expenses decreased to million in the year ended december  as compared to million in the year ended december   a decrease of  
our average cost per mcf of transportation and compression decreased to 
in the year ended december  as compared to 
in the year ended december   a decrease of 

this decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in compressor expenses due to our purchase of several compressors in the year which we had previously leased 
our general and administrative expenses increased to million in the year ended december  as compared to million in the year ended december   an increase of million 
this increase includes the following o million of general and administrative expenses associated with the operations of spectrum which we acquired on july  o  for the expensing of phantom units issued under our long term incentive plan and the related distributions on those units  o  in increased allocations of compensation and benefits from atlas america and its affiliates due to an increase in management time spent on our acquisition and public offerings  and o  from costs associated with the implementation of sarbanes oxley and the preparation and filing of two tax returns for the filing of two tax returns was a result of our general partner s percentage interest in us being reduced below as a result of our offering of common units in may  requiring a change in our tax year end from september th to december st which necessitated the filing of an additional short year tax return 
this expense is non recurring 
our depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in the year ended december  as compared to million in the year ended december   an increase of million 
this increase resulted from depreciation associated with the acquisition of spectrum million  and our increased asset base associated with pipeline extensions and compressor upgrades 
we anticipate that our depreciation expense will increase in as a result of a full year of depreciation associated with aplmc and depreciation associated with our pipeline extensions and compressor upgrades 
our interest expense increased to million in the year ended december  as compared to  in the year ended december  this increase of million resulted from increased borrowings in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  in july  we borrowed million to partially fund our acquisition of spectrum 
subsequently  in july  we repaid million of these borrowings upon the completion of our public offering 
in december  we borrowed million on our revolver facility in order to repay million of our term loan borrowings 
our interest expense in the year ended december  consisted of fees on our outstanding borrowings  commitment fees on amounts not drawn on our credit facility  and amortization of our debt issuance costs 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
our transportation and compression revenues increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this increase of million resulted from an increase in the average transportation rate paid to us million and an increase in the volumes of natural gas we transported 
our transportation rate was 
per mcf in the year ended december  as compared to 
per mcf in the year ended december   an increase of 
per mcf 
during the year ended december   natural gas prices increased significantly over the year ended december  since our transportation rates are generally at fixed percentages of the sale prices of the natural gas we transport  the higher prices resulted in an increase in our average transportation rate 
our average daily throughput volumes were  mcfs in the year ended december  as compared to  mcfs in the year ended december   an increase of  mcfs 
the increase in the average daily throughput volume resulted principally from volumes associated with new wells added to our pipeline system  we turned on line and wells in the years ended december  and  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by the natural decline in production volumes from existing wells connected to our gathering systems 
costs and expenses 
our transportation and compression expenses increased to million in the year ended december  as compared to million in the year ended december   an increase of  
our average cost per mcf of transportation and compression increased to 
in the year ended december  as compared to 
in the year ended december   an increase of 

this increase resulted primarily from an increase in compressor expenses due to the addition of more compressors and increased lease rates for our compressors 
however  during  we have substantially completed the process of purchasing several compressors which we previously leased 
we anticipate this will reduce future compressor expenses on a per mcf basis 
our general and administrative expenses increased to million in the year ended december  as compared to million in the year ended december   an increase of  
this increase primarily resulted from an increase of  in allocations of compensation and benefits from atlas america and its affiliates due to an increase in management time spent during the year on acquisitions  potential acquisitions and our public offering 
this increase was largely offset by a decrease in professional fees which  in the prior period  had been higher than normal due to costs associated with the proposed acquisition of triton coal company 
we were also reimbursed  by atlas america in the year ended december  for one half of our unreimbursed costs associated with the proposed triton acquisition 
our depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in the year ended december  as compared to million in the year ended december   an increase of  
this increase resulted from our increased asset base associated with pipeline extensions and compressor upgrades and purchases 
liquidity and capital resources our primary cash requirements  in addition to normal operating expenses  are for debt service  maintenance capital expenditures  expansion capital expenditures and quarterly distributions to our unitholders and general partner 
in addition to cash generated from operations  we have the ability to meet our cash requirements  other than distributions to our unitholders and general partner  through borrowings under our credit facility 
in general  we expect to fund o cash distributions and maintenance capital expenditures through existing cash and cash flows from operating activities  o expansion capital expenditures and working capital deficits through the retention of cash and additional borrowings  o debt principal payments through additional borrowings as they become due or by the issuance of additional common units 
at december   we had outstanding and million of remaining borrowing capacity under our credit facilities 
the following table summarizes our financial condition and liquidity at the dates indicated at december  current ratio x x x working capital in thousands   ratio of long term debt to total partners capital 
x n a 
x net cash provided by operations of million in the year ended december  increased million from million in the year ended december  the increase is derived principally from an increase in net income before depreciation and amortization as a result of an increase in volumes transported and prices received for our natural gas and ngls 
net income before depreciation and amortization was million in the year ended december   an increase of million from the year ended december  this increase was principally due to the acquisition of spectrum on july   resulting in five and one half months of operations included in the current period 
this increase was also due to the increase in the average transportation rate we received in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  during the year ended december   our accounts payable affiliates decreased as a result of the reimbursement of advances from atlas america in connection with expenses associated with the terminated alaska pipeline acquisition 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   an increase of million from million in the year ended december  this increase was principally due to the acquisition of spectrum on july  in addition  capital expenditures related to gathering system extensions and compressor upgrades to accommodate new wells increased million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   an increase of million from million in the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase was an increase in proceeds received from our public offerings of million and increased net borrowings of million on our revolving credit facility to fund our acquisition of spectrum 
this increase was partially offset by an increase of million in distributions to partners in the current year period as a result of an increase in net cash flow from operations and units outstanding 
partnership distributions our partnership agreement requires that we distribute of available cash to our partners within days following the end of each calendar quarter in accordance with their respective percentage interests 
available cash consists generally of all of our cash receipts  less cash disbursements and net additions to reserves  including any reserves required under debt instruments for future principal and interest payments 
our general partner is granted discretion by our partnership agreement to establish  maintain and adjust reserves for future operating expenses  debt service  maintenance capital expenditures  rate refunds and distributions for the next four quarters 
these reserves are not restricted by magnitude  but only by type of future cash requirements with which they can be associated 
when our general partner determines our quarterly distributions  it considers current and expected reserve needs along with current and expected cash flows to identify the appropriate sustainable distribution level 
available cash is initially distributed to our limited partners and to our general partner 
these distribution percentages are modified to provide for incentive distributions to be paid to our general partner if quarterly distributions to unitholders exceed specified targets  as described in item of this report 
incentive distributions are generally defined as all cash distributions paid to our general partner that are in excess of of the aggregate amount of cash being distributed 
the general partner s incentive distributions declared for year ended december  was million 
capital expenditures our property and equipment was approximately and of our total consolidated assets at december  and  respectively 
capital expenditures  other than the acquisition of spectrum  were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these capital expenditures principally consisted of costs relating to the expansion of our existing gathering systems to accommodate new wells drilled in our service area and compressor upgrades 
during  we connected wells to our appalachian gathering system 
as of december   we were committed to expend approximately million on pipeline extensions and compressor station upgrades 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures will increase in as a result of an increase in the estimated number of well connections to our gathering systems 
inflation and changes in prices inflation affects the operating expenses of our gathering systems 
increases in those expenses are not necessarily offset by increases in transportation fees that the gathering operations are able to charge 
while we anticipate that inflation will affect our future operating costs  we cannot predict the timing or amounts of any such effects 
in addition  the value of our gathering systems has been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas prices 
natural gas prices are subject to fluctuations which we are unable to control or accurately predict 
environmental regulation our operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the release of regulated materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection or human health or safety 
we believe that our operations and facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
any failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  imposition of remedial requirements  and issuance of injunctions as to future compliance or other mandatory or consensual measures 
we have an ongoing environmental compliance program 
however  risks of accidental leaks or spills are associated with the transportation of natural gas 
there can be no assurance that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities relating to claims for damages to property  the environment  natural resources  or persons resulting from the operation of our business 
moreover  it is possible that other developments  such as increasingly strict environmental laws and regulations and enforcement policies hereunder  could result in increased costs and liabilities to us 
environmental laws and regulations have changed substantially and rapidly over the last years  and we anticipate that there will be continuing changes 
one trend in environmental regulation is to increase reporting obligations and place more restrictions and limitations on activities  such as emissions of pollutants  generation and disposal of wastes and use  storage and handling of chemical substances  that may impact human health  the environment and or endangered species 
increasingly strict environmental restrictions and limitations have resulted in increased operating costs for us and other similar businesses throughout the united states 
it is possible that the costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations may continue to increase 
we will attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and to plan accordingly  but there can be no assurance that we will identify and properly anticipate each such charge  or that our efforts will prevent material costs  if any  from arising 
credit facility concurrently with the completion of the spectrum acquisition  in july  we entered into a million senior secured term loan and revolving credit facility administered by wachovia bank that replaced our million facility 
the facility originally included a million four year revolving line of credit and a million five year term loan 
upon the completion of our july public offering  we repaid million of the million term loan we had borrowed in order to complete the acquisition of spectrum  and in december  we repaid an additional million by borrowing million on our revolving line of credit 
in august and december  the revolving credit portion of the credit facility was increased to million and million  respectively 
up to million of the facility may be used for standby letters of credit 
borrowings under the facility are secured by a lien on and security interest in all of our property and that of our subsidiaries and by the guaranty of each of our subsidiaries 
the credit facility bears interest at one of two rates  elected at our option o the base rate plus the applicable margin  or o the adjusted libor plus the applicable margin 
the base rate for any day equals the higher of the federal funds rate plus of or the wachovia bank prime rate 
the applicable margin for the revolving line of credit is as follows o where our leverage ratio  that is  the ratio of its debt to our earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  is less than or equal to  the applicable margin is for base rate loans and for libor loans  o where our leverage ratio is greater than but less than or equal to  the applicable margin is for base rate loans and for libor loans  o where our leverage ratio is greater than but less than or equal to  the applicable margin is for base rate loans and for libor loans  and o where our leverage ratio is greater than  the applicable margin is for base rate loans and for libor loans 
the applicable margin for the term loan is higher for both base rate loans and libor loans 
the credit facility requires us to maintain a ratio of funded debt to ebitda of not more than to  reducing to to on june  and an interest coverage ratio of not less than to in addition  we are required to prepay the term loan with the net proceeds of any asset sales or issuances of debt 
with respect to any issuances of equity  it is required to repay the term loan from the proceeds of such issuances to the extent its ratio of funded debt to ebitda exceeds to we are required to pay down  in principal on the outstanding balance of the term loan quarterly 
any prepayments of principal with proceeds from asset or equity sales that it makes will be credited pro rata against this repayment obligation 
the credit agreement contains covenants customary for loans of this size  including restrictions on incurring additional debt and making material acquisitions  and a prohibition on paying distributions to atlas pipeline s unitholders if an event of default occurs 
the events  which constitute an event of default  are also customary for loans of this size  including payment defaults  breaches of our representations or covenants contained in the credit agreement  adverse judgments against it in excess of a specified amount  and a change of control of our general partner 
we had million outstanding on our revolving credit facility at a rate of and million outstanding on our term loan at a rate of at december  in addition  we had million outstanding under letters of credit 
annual debt principal payments over the next five fiscal periods ending december are as follows million  million  million  million  million

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of actual revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from those estimates 
changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
key estimates used by our management include estimates used to record revenue and expense accruals  depreciation and amortization  asset impairment and fair values of assets acquired 
we summarize our significant accounting policies in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we discuss below the critical accounting policies that we have identified 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues in the appalachian basin area at the time the natural gas is transported through the gathering systems 
under the terms of our natural gas gathering agreements with atlas america and its affiliates  we receive fees for gathering natural gas from wells owned by atlas america  by drilling investment partnerships sponsored by atlas america or by independent third parties 
the fees received for the gathering services are generally the greater of of the gross sales price for gas produced from the wells  or 
or 
per mcf  depending on the ownership of the well 
substantially all gas gathering revenues are derived under this agreement 
fees for transportation services provided to independent third parties whose wells are connected to our gathering systems are at separately negotiated prices 
we recognize revenues in the mid continent area at the time the natural gas is purchased  processed and the resulting residue gas and ngls are sold 
the majority of these revenues are based on pop contracts  the remainder are fixed fee contracts 
under our pop purchasing arrangements  we purchase natural gas at the wellhead  process the natural gas by extracting ngls and removing impurities and sell the residue gas and ngls at market based prices  remitting to producers a contractually determined percentage of the sale proceeds 
we routinely make accruals for both revenues and expenses due to the timing of receiving information from third parties and reconciling our records with those of third parties 
we have determined these estimates using available market data and valuation methodologies 
we believe our estimates for these items are reasonable  but cannot assure you that actual amounts will not vary from estimated amounts 
depreciation and amortization we calculate our depreciation based on the estimated useful lives and salvage values of our assets 
however  factors such as usage  equipment failure  competition  regulation or environmental matters could cause us to change our estimates  thus impacting the future calculation of depreciation and amortization 
impairment of assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas   accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
we determine if our long lived assets are impaired by comparing the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets with the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with such asset or group of assets 
if the carrying amount is greater than the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying value to fair value 
our operations are subject to numerous factors which could affect future cash flows which we discuss in item  business risk factors 
we continuously monitor these factors and pursue alternative strategies to maintain or enhance cash flows associated with these assets  however  we cannot assure you that we can mitigate the effects  if any  on future cash flows related to any changes in these factors 
goodwill at december   we had million of goodwill  all of which relates to our acquisition of pipeline assets 
we test our goodwill for impairment at each year end by comparing fair values to our carrying values 
the evaluation of impairment under sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  requires the use of projections  estimates and assumptions as to the future performance of the operations  including anticipated future revenues  expected future operating costs and the discount factor used 
actual results could differ from projections resulting in revisions to our assumptions and  if required  recognizing an impairment loss 
our test during the current year resulted in no impairment 
we will continue to evaluate our goodwill at least annually and will reflect the impairment of goodwill  if any  in operating income in the income statement in the period in which the impairment is indicated 
fair value of derivative commodity contracts we utilize various exchange traded and over the counter commodity financial instrument contracts to limit our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas and ngl prices  primarily commodity forwards  futures  swaps  options and certain basis contracts 
many of these contracts  which  in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  are not accounted for as hedges  are marked to fair value on the income statement 
we utilize published settlement prices for exchange traded contracts  and for our other contracts  use quotes provided by brokers  and estimates of market prices based on daily contract activity to estimate the fair value of these contracts 
the values have been adjusted to reflect the potential impact of liquidating a position in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under existing market conditions 
changes in the methods used to determine the fair value of these contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations 
we do not anticipate future changes in the methods used to determine the fair value of these derivative contracts 

on our contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 the effective portion of the hedged gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings when the instrument settles 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately 
volume measurement we record amounts for natural gas gathering and transportation revenue  ngl transportation and processing revenue  natural gas sales and natural gas purchases  and the sale of production based on volumetric calculations 
variances resulting from such calculations are inherent in our business 
recently issued financial accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
r revised share based payment  which is a revision of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes accounting principal board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach to accounting in statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
currently the company accounts for these payments under the intrinsic value provisions of apb no 
with no expense recognition in the financial statements 
statement r is effective for the partnership beginning july  the statement offers several alternatives for implementation 
at this time  management has not made a decision as to the alternative it may select 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and oil and gas prices 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonable possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading 
general all of our assets and liabilities are denominated in us dollars  and as a result  we do not have exposure to currency exchange risks 
we are exposed to various market risks  principally fluctuating interest rates and changes in commodity prices 
these risks can impact our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
we manage these risks through regular operating and financing activities and periodically use derivative financial instruments 
the following analysis presents the effect on our earnings  cash flows and financial position as if the hypothetical changes in market risk factors occurred on december  only the potential impacts of hypothetical assumptions are analyzed 
the analysis does not consider other possible effects that could impact our business 
interest rate risk at december   we had a million revolving credit facility million outstanding and a million term loan million outstanding to fund the expansion of our existing gathering systems and the acquisitions of other natural gas gathering systems 
the weighted average interest rate for these borrowings was at december  holding all other variables constant  if interest rates hypothetically increased or decreased by  our net annual income would change by approximately  commodity price risk 
we are exposed to commodity prices as a result of being paid for certain services in the form of commodities rather than cash 
for gathering services  we receive fees or commodities from the producers to bring the raw natural gas from the wellhead to the processing plant 
for processing services  we either receive fees or commodities as payment for these services  based on the type of contractual agreement 
based on our current contract mix  we have a long ngl position and a long gas position 
based upon our portfolio of supply contracts  a change in the average price of ngls  the average price of natural gas and the average price of crude oil sold and processed by aplmc would result in a change to our annual income of approximately million 
through our subsidiary  aplmc  we acquired and or entered into certain financial swap and option instruments that are classified as cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas no 
aplmc entered into these instruments to hedge the forecasted natural gas  natural gas liquids and condensate sales against the variability in expected future cash flows attributable to changes in market prices 
the swap instruments are contractual agreements between counterparties to exchange obligations of money as the underlying natural gas  natural gas liquids and condensate is sold 
under these swap agreements  aplmc receives a fixed price and pays a floating price based on certain indices for the relevant contract period 
the options fix the price for aplmc within the puts purchased and calls sold 
derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities at fair value 
for derivatives qualifying as hedges  the effective portion of changes in fair value are recognized in stockholders equity as other comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings as such transactions are settled 
for non qualifying derivatives and for the ineffective portion of qualifying derivatives  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings as they occur 
at december   we reflected a hedging liability on our balance sheet of million 
of the million liability at december   million of losses will be reclassified to earnings over the next twelve month period as these contracts expire and  in later periods  if the fair values of the instruments remain constant 
actual amounts that will be reclassified will vary as a result of future changes in prices 
we recognized a loss of  related to these hedging instruments in the year ended december  ineffective gains or losses are recorded in income while the hedge contract is open and may increase or decrease until settlement of the contract 
a loss of  resulting from ineffective hedges is included in income for the year ended december  these losses are included in natural gas and liquids revenues on the partnership s consolidated statements of income 
a portion of our future natural gas sales is periodically hedged through the use of swaps and collar contracts 
we reflect realized gains and losses on these instruments in the contract month being hedged as an adjustment to gas revenue 
as of december   atlas pipeline had the following natural gas liquids  natural gas  and crude oil volumes hedged 
natural gas liquids fixed price swaps production average fair value period volumes fixed price liability calendar year gallons per gallon in thousands natural gas fixed price swaps production average fair value period volumes fixed price liability calendar year mmbtu per mmbtu in thousands crude oil fixed price swaps production average fair value period volumes fixed price liability calendar year barrels per barrel in thousands crude oil options production average fair value period option type volumes strike price liability calendar year barrels per barrel in thousands puts purchased  calls sold  total liability  mmbtu means million british thermal units 
fair value based on aplmc internal model which forecasts forward natural gas liquid prices as a function of forward nymex natural gas and light crude prices 
fair value based on forward nymex natural gas and light crude prices  as applicable
