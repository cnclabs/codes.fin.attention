overview we provide a suite of solutions that automate employee centric processes and provide tools to optimize the workforce 
our solutions  which include human resources  payroll  scheduling and time and labor applications  are designed for a wide range of businesses and organizations from single site to large multi site enterprises 
we derive revenues from the licensing of our software solutions  sales of our hardware solutions and by providing professional services as well as ongoing customer support and maintenance 
our revenues in fiscal increased million  or  over fiscal the growth in our revenues was attributable to revenues from our core business as well as growth in revenues from acquired businesses 
maintenance revenues increased million  or  professional services revenues increased million  or  and product revenues increased million  or 
net income for fiscal increased to million from million  with earnings per share increasing to from per diluted share 
net income growth for fiscal was primarily the result of continued growth in our revenues  partially offset by an increase in operating expenses associated with an increase in compensation and related overhead and support costs required for the support of our growing operations including the hiring of additional personnel  as well as expenses related to the implementation of our new information technology system and audit and consulting fees relating to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of regarding expectations for fiscal  we presently anticipate that revenue growth  excluding revenues from customers obtained in the acquisition of businesses in fiscal  if any  to range between for both the entire fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal excluding the impact of financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement no 
revised  share based payment  or statement r  we expect earnings per diluted share in the range of for the entire fiscal and for the first quarter 
we expect that the impact of statement r including outstanding  unvested awards and new awards will be approximately for the entire fiscal and for the first quarter 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of consolidated financial statements 
this listing is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
please refer to note a in the notes to consolidated financial statements included as part of this annual report on form k for further information 
revenue recognition we license software and sell data collection hardware and related ancillary products to end user customers through our direct sales force as well as indirect channel customers  which include adp and other independent resellers 
substantially all of our software license revenue is earned from perpetual licenses of off the shelf software requiring no modification or customization 
the software license  data collection hardware and related ancillary product revenues from our end user customers and indirect channel customers are generally recognized using the residual method when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  which is typically when a non cancelable sales and software license agreement has been signed  delivery  which is typically fob shipping point  is complete for the software either physically or electronically  data collection hardware and related ancillary products  the customer s fee is deemed to be fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties  collectibility is probable  and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all undelivered elements  typically maintenance and professional services 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue  assuming all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
substantially all of our product revenue is recognized in this manner 
if we cannot determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in an arrangement  we will defer revenue until all elements are delivered  services are performed or until fair value can be objectively determined 
as part of an arrangement  end user customers typically purchase maintenance contracts as well as professional services from us 
maintenance services include telephone and web based support as well as rights to unspecified upgrades and enhancements  when and if we make them generally available 
professional services are typically deemed to be non essential to the functionality of the software and typically are for implementation planning  loading of software  installation of the data collection hardware  training  building simple interfaces  running test data and assisting in the development and documentation of pay rules and best practices consulting 
revenues from maintenance services are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract period based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based upon the amount charged when purchased separately  which is typically the contract s renewal rate 
maintenance services are typically stated separately in an arrangement 
we have classified the allocated fair value of revenues pertaining to the contractual maintenance obligations that exist for the month period subsequent to the balance sheet date as a current liability  and the contractual obligations with a term beyond months as a non current liability 
revenues from time and material customer support services are recognized as the services are delivered 
revenues from professional services are generally recognized based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value when a non cancelable agreement for the services has been signed or a customer s purchase order has been received  the professional services have been delivered  the customer s fee is deemed to be fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties  and collectibility is probable 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based upon the price charged when these services are sold separately and are typically an hourly rate for professional services and a per class rate for training 
based upon our experience in completing product implementations  we have determined that these services are typically delivered within a month period subsequent to the contract signing  and we therefore have classified deferred professional services as a current liability 
our arrangements with end user customers and indirect channel customers do not include any rights of return or price protection  nor do arrangements with indirect channel customers include any acceptance provisions 
our arrangements with end user customers generally include our standard acceptance provision 
our standard acceptance provision provides the end user customer with a right to a refund if the arrangement is terminated because the product did not meet our published technical specifications 
generally  we determine that these acceptance provisions are not substantive and therefore should be accounted for as a warranty in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
at the time we enter into an arrangement  we assess the probability of collection of the fee and the terms granted to the customer 
for end user customers  our typical payment terms include payments based on specific due dates  such that all payments for the software license  data collection hardware and related ancillary products  as well as training services included in the original arrangement  are ordinarily paid within one year of contract signing 
professional services are typically rendered on a buy as you go basis such that the customer is invoiced for services on a monthly basis  in arrears 
professional services billings are generally due within days of the invoice date 
our payment terms for indirect channel customers are less than days and payments are typically due within days of the invoice date 
if the arrangement includes a substantive acceptance provision  we defer revenue not meeting the criterion for recognition under statement of position  software revenue recognition  and classify this revenue as deferred revenue  including deferred product revenue 
this revenue is recognized  assuming all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied  when the uncertainty regarding acceptance is resolved as generally evidenced by written acceptance or payment of the arrangement fee 
if the payment terms for the arrangement are considered extended  other than those arrangements that are financing arrangements as discussed below  we defer revenue on the arrangement until the payment of the arrangement fee becomes due 
the deferred amounts related to arrangements with extended payment terms are removed from deferred revenue and accounts receivable  as we have determined that these amounts do not represent either a receivable or deferred revenue until the payment becomes due 
we report the allocated fair value of revenues related to the product element of arrangements as a current liability because of the expectation that these revenues will be recognized within months of the balance sheet date 
since fiscal  we have had a standard practice of providing creditworthy end user customers the option of financing arrangements beyond one year 
our policy for recognizing revenue and the timing of the recognition for arrangements that are financed is the same as our non financed arrangements 
the financed arrangements  which encompass separate fees for software license  data collection hardware and ancillary products  maintenance and support contracts  and professional services  are evidenced by distinct standard sales  license and maintenance agreements and typically require equal monthly payments 
the terms of these arrangements typically range between and months 
the short term component amounts due within months of these financing arrangements is included in accounts receivable on our balance sheet 
the long term component is included in other assets 
at the time we enter into an arrangement  we assess the probability of collection and whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable 
we consider our history of collection without concessions as well as whether each new transaction involves similar customers  products and arrangement economics to ensure that the history developed under previous arrangements remains relevant to current arrangements 
if the fee is not determined to be collectible  fixed or determinable  we will initially defer the revenue and recognize it when collection becomes probable  which typically is when payment is due  assuming all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
as a financing arrangement  we apply a present value factor using annual interest rates ranging from to 
these rates may vary depending upon when the financing arrangement is entered into and the length of the financing arrangement 
as a result of the ad opt acquisition completed on november  and the i systems acquisition completed on september   we have begun to provide customized software solutions to our customers 
revenue related to the sale of customized software solutions is recognized on a contract accounting basis in accordance with the provisions of statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
the contract accounting is applied based on a percentage of completion basis generally representing labor costs incurred relative to total estimated labor costs 
provisions for estimated losses on contracts are recorded when identified 
deferred revenues are recorded when invoicing exceeds recognized revenues 
revenue derived from the development and delivery of customized software solutions are included in product revenues 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns allowance we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
this allowance is based on estimates made by us after consideration of factors such as the composition of the accounts receivable aging and bad debt history 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances and bad debt expense may be required 
in addition  we maintain a sales returns allowance to reflect estimated losses for sales returns and adjustments 
sales returns and adjustments are generally due to incorrect ordering of product  general customer satisfaction issues or incorrect billing 
this allowance is established by us using estimates based on historical experience 
if we experience an increase in sales returns and adjustments  additional allowances and charges against revenue may be required 
estimates used to establish the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns allowance have been consistently applied 
these reserves may increase when certain factors indicating a need for a reserve increase are present in our accounts receivable aging  bad debt history or sales returns history 
valuation of intangible assets and goodwill in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges against these assets in the reporting period in which the impairment is determined 
for intangible assets  this evaluation includes an analysis of estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets over their estimated useful lives 
if the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets over their estimated useful lives  we will record an impairment charge in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value 
for goodwill  the impairment evaluation includes a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting unit for which goodwill is attributable to that reporting unit s fair value 
we have only one reporting unit 
the fair value of the reporting unit is based upon the net present value of future cash flows  including a terminal value calculation 
if the reporting unit s estimated fair value exceeds the reporting unit s carrying value  no impairment of goodwill exists 
if the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed its carrying value  then further analysis would be required to determine the amount of the impairment  if any 
if we determine that there is an impairment in either an intangible asset or goodwill  we will be required to record an impairment charge in the reporting period in which the impairment is determined 
during fiscal and fiscal we completed the annual testing of the impairment of goodwill  and as a result of those tests  we concluded that no impairment of goodwill existed as of july   or july   the annual goodwill impairment measurement dates for fiscal and  respectively 
in addition  we have determined that no events or circumstances currently exist or existed during fiscal or fiscal that would indicate that either the fair value of the reporting unit has been reduced  or the carrying value of the intangible assets is no longer recoverable 
therefore  no impairment charges have been recorded in fiscal or capitalization of software development costs costs incurred in the research  design and development of software for sale to others  which we refer to as software development costs  are charged to expense until technological feasibility is established 
thereafter  software development costs are capitalized and amortized to product cost of sales on a straight line basis over the lesser of three years or the estimated economic lives of the respective products 
in addition to the software development costs described above  costs incurred in the development of software for internal use are charged to expense until it becomes probable that future economic benefits will be realized 
thereafter  certain costs are capitalized and amortized to operating expense on a straight line basis 
we have determined  due to the scope of the project and based on the expected estimated economic life of the software  that the capitalized costs related to the current replacement of the company s information technology systems will be amortized over a period of five years 
for other projects related to the development of software for internal use  we will generally amortize the capitalized costs over the lesser of three years or the estimated economic life of the software 
we have capitalized approximately million including internal personnel related costs in costs associated with the replacement of information technology systems since the start of this project in fiscal income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we record a valuation allowance in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  there is no assurance that the valuation allowance will not need to be increased to cover additional deferred tax assets that may not be realizable 
any increase in the valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made 
results of operations revenues 
we derive revenues from the licensing of our software solutions  sales of our hardware solutions and by providing professional services as well as ongoing customer support and maintenance 
total revenues dollars in thousands fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal total revenues the principal factors driving revenue growth in fiscal were revenues from an increased demand for our maintenance and professional services and for our software and hardware products  and revenues from acquired businesses 
the principal factors driving revenue growth in fiscal were increased demand for our software and hardware products from new customers and continued demand for our professional and maintenance services from new and existing customers  as well as revenues from acquired businesses 
fiscal fiscal fiscal revenues from acquired businesses percentage of total revenues revenues from acquired businesses are revenues generated from customers that have been part of an acquired business transaction over the preceding four fiscal quarters 
product revenues dollars in thousands fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal product revenues product revenues as a percent of total revenues product revenue growth in fiscal was primarily due to an increase in demand for our workforce central suite and related software modules as well as our kronos terminal 
product revenues attributable to acquired businesses were also a primary factor in the increase in product revenue in fiscal the increased demand in fiscal was primarily the result of continued innovation of our existing products  the introduction of new products  and upgrade activity 
product revenues grew in fiscal primarily due to an increase in customer demand for our workforce central suite and related software modules  our kronos iseries central suite  as well as our kronos terminal 
the increased demand in fiscal was primarily the result of the introduction of new software features and functionality  as well as new and platform conversion sales 
also impacting product revenue growth in fiscal and was the change in deferred product revenues recorded on our balance sheet 
deferred product revenue decreased from million at september   to million at september  deferred product revenue increased from million at september   to million at september  in addition  product revenues in fiscal benefited less from incremental revenues from acquired businesses due to the specific timing of acquisitions than in fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal revenues from acquired businesses percentage of product revenues maintenance revenues dollars in thousands fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal maintenance revenues maintenance revenues as a percent of total revenues the increase in maintenance revenues in fiscal and was principally the result of expansion of our installed base of software solutions  resulting from an increase in demand for our workforce central suite and related software modules in the preceding periods  and an increase in the value of maintenance contracts 
the increase in the value of the maintenance contracts was principally attributable to sales of capacity upgrade licenses and add on modules to existing customers 
capacity upgrade and add on module sales typically result in an increased value of maintenance contracts due to the increased selling price for the products 
revenue generated by a particular maintenance contract is typically based on the related product s selling price 
maintenance revenues in fiscal were also positively affected by revenues from acquired businesses 
fiscal fiscal fiscal revenues from acquired businesses percentage of maintenance revenues professional services revenues dollars in thousands fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal professional services revenues professional services revenues as a percent of total revenues the growth in professional services revenues in fiscal was primarily due to an increase in demand for professional services  which was the result of an increase in product sales to new customers  and an increase in available services delivery capacity as compared to fiscal to meet the increased demand for professional services  as well as an increase in the level of professional services accompanying sales to our customers 
the increase in demand was primarily due to an expansion of our complementary product offerings  as well as an expansion of our consulting and value added professional services offerings 
professional services revenues in fiscal were also positively impacted by an increase in professional services revenue associated with acquired businesses 
the growth in professional services revenues in fiscal was principally due to an increase in customer demand for professional services  which was the result of an increase in product sales to new customers 
an increase in the level of professional services accompanying new and platform conversion sales  which resulted in the delivery of additional professional services hours during the implementations also contributed to the growth in professional services revenue 
further contributing to the growth of the professional services revenue in fiscal and was an increase in the utilization rate experienced in the services organization in both years as compared to the respective prior fiscal year 
fiscal fiscal fiscal revenues from acquired businesses percentage of professional services revenues international revenues dollars in thousands international revenues include revenues from our international subsidiaries and sales to independent international resellers 
fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal international revenues international revenues as a percent of total revenues the growth in international revenues in fiscal was primarily the result of revenues attributable to acquired businesses 
the growth in international revenues in fiscal was primarily attributable to the timing of several large customer orders which were executed during fiscal we presently expect international revenues in to grow at a rate comparable to that of our consolidated results discussed previously in the overview section 
gross profit 
gross profit is the net result of revenues  less cost of sales 
product cost of sales primarily consists of salaries  facilities and related expenses for manufacturing personnel and personnel developing and delivering customized software solutions  costs of materials for the manufacturing of certain hardware products  amortization of capitalized software costs and acquired technology  as well as the cost of royalties paid to third parties for certain products 
service cost of sales primarily consists of salaries  facilities and related expenses for service personnel  as well as the cost of maintenance contracts paid to third parties for certain products 
gross profit gross margin dollars in thousands fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal product gross profit service gross profit total gross profit product gross margin service gross margin total gross margin total gross margin in fiscal remained consistent with total gross margin in fiscal total gross margin increased in fiscal to from in fiscal due to an increase in product gross margin in fiscal this increase in product gross margin was partially offset by a higher proportion of services revenues  which typically carry a lower gross margin 
product gross margin remained consistent in fiscal as compared to fiscal although we experienced a higher gross margin on revenues from our hardware products  primarily due to increased sales volume  this increase in gross margin was offset by a decrease in software gross margin 
the decrease in software gross margin was primarily attributable to a higher proportion of software revenues associated with our customized and human resources management system  or hrms  software products  which generate lower gross margins than our other software products 
product gross margin increased in fiscal primarily due to a favorable product mix during the periods 
product revenues from hardware and software  which typically carry a higher gross margin than sales of third party product for resale  were a greater proportion of total product revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
service gross margin in fiscal increased as compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in the utilization rate and other productivity improvements experienced by the services organization in fiscal these improvements were the result of more effective management of the services organization as well as our expanding use of more efficient implementation methodologies  such as remote services 
service gross margin in fiscal remained consistent with fiscal although the proportion of professional services revenues which carries a lower gross profit than maintenance revenues to total service revenues in fiscal increased as compared to fiscal  the impact on service gross margin related to this unfavorable service mix was offset by an increase in the utilization rate of the service personnel as compared to fiscal the utilization rate increase was in part due to an increase in the productivity in our implementations related to sales of our human resources and payroll products 
net operating expenses 
net operating expenses includes sales and marketing expenses  engineering  research and development expenses  general and administrative expenses  amortization of intangible assets and other income  net 
total net operating expenses dollars in thousands fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal net operating expenses net operating expenses as a of total revenues the increase in total net operating expenses in fiscal and was principally attributable to investments in personnel and related compensation  overhead  and support costs in response to increased customer demand and to support the development of new products  including the hiring of additional personnel approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the following discussions on each functional area analyze the spending in further detail 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel and overhead related expenses for sales and marketing functions  as well as costs associated with advertising  promotions  tradeshows  seminars  training and other sales and marketing programs dollars in thousands 
fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses as a of total revenues the increase in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal was primarily the result of continued investment in sales personnel and related compensation  overhead and support costs associated with higher sales volume and support costs to add new customers and to maximize the penetration of existing customer accounts  which includes the hiring of additional personnel approximately million 
increased spending related to consulting and professional services fees approximately million as well as an increase in spending on marketing programs approximately million also contributed to the increase in sales and marketing expenses 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal  which includes the hiring of additional personnel approximately million was primarily attributable to investment in sales personnel and related compensation and support costs to add new customers and to maximize the penetration of existing accounts 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues for fiscal and was primarily attributable to leveraging our investments in infrastructure to generate higher sales volumes  as well as an improvement in productivity 
engineering  research and development expenses engineering  research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel and overhead related expenses for engineering functions  as well as costs associated with training and third party consulting dollars in thousands 
fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal total engineering  research and development spending capitalized software development costs engineering  research and development expenses engineering  research and development expenses as a of total revenues the increase in engineering  research and development spending in both fiscal and was attributable to continued investment in engineering personnel and their compensation  overhead and support costs  which include the hiring of additional personnel approximately million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
this increase in spending was the result of the continued development and support of new products 
the significant project development efforts in fiscal were principally related to further development and enhancement of the workforce central suite  including workforce hr and workforce payroll software  workforce scheduler and workforce scheduler with optimization  altitude  total care  and the kronos terminal 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel and other overhead related expenses for administrative  information technology  finance  legal and human resources support functions dollars in thousands 
fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses as a of total revenues the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal was primarily due to investment in personnel and related compensation  overhead and support costs required for the continued support of our growing operations approximately million 
these expenses include the hiring of additional personnel  including costs associated with certain order management related functions that were reclassified from sales and marketing expenses to general and administrative expenses 
also contributing to the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal was an increase in bad debt provisions approximately million resulting from our periodic calculation of our bad debt reserve requirements 
the increase in reserve requirements is in response to a weakening of the accounts receivable aging due in part to the loss of productivity of certain credit and collections personnel in the periods following the completion of the first phase of the implementation of our new information technology systems 
further contributing to the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal was an increase in expenses related to the implementation of our new information technology system approximately million and an increase in professional fees related to our compliance efforts with respect to the sarbanes oxley act of approximately million 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal was primarily due to investment in personnel and related compensation  overhead and support costs required for the continued support of our growing operations  which includes the hiring of additional personnel approximately million  and an increase in fees related to consulting services and training associated with the replacement of information technology systems approximately million 
amortization of intangible assets and other income  net amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization expense related to certain identified intangible assets recorded by us related to acquisitions of other businesses 
customer related intangible assets and intangible assets related to maintenance relationships and technology are generally amortized over lives ranging between and years 
intangible assets related to non compete agreements are generally amortized over the life of the related non compete agreement 
other income  net is principally interest income earned from cash as well as investments in our marketable securities and financing arrangements dollars in thousands 
fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets as a of total revenues other income  net other income  net as a of total revenues the increase in amortization of intangible assets in both fiscal and fiscal was principally attributable to amortization charges related to acquisitions which were completed during those years 
the increase in other income  net in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was principally attributable to the reversal of excess interest and other tax related accruals as a result of the favorable completion of certain tax audits during fiscal  as well as an increase in interest income generated from the increased portfolio of marketable securities 
these increases were partially offset by lower levels of foreign exchange gains realized during fiscal as a result of less favorable changes in foreign exchange rates experienced as compared to fiscal income taxes 
the provision for income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the provision for income taxes was favorably affected in fiscal as a result of the completion of certain tax audits during fiscal and certain tax planning strategies 
we currently anticipate that the income tax rate will range approximately between in fiscal our effective income tax rate may fluctuate between periods as a result of various factors  including income tax credits  foreign tax rate differentials  state income taxes  and the resolution of tax audits or accruals for tax exposures 
newly issued accounting standards 
on december   the fasb issued statement r  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or statement statement r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or opinion no 
 and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including the grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure regarding share based payments is no longer an alternative 
statement r must be adopted for annual periods beginning after june  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not been issued 
we adopted statement r on october   the beginning of our fiscal year 
as permitted by statement  we currently account for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
we expect that the impact of statement r will be approximately per diluted share for the entire fiscal and per diluted share for the first quarter 
had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note a to our consolidated financial statements included as part of this annual report on form k 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources we fund our business through cash generated by operations 
if near term demand for our products weakens  or if significant anticipated sales in any quarter do not close when expected  the availability of such funds may be adversely impacted 
to be more in line with industry practices  effective april   we completed the change in our business to a process in which our customers are billed in arrears for professional services as the services are delivered  rather than in advance of service delivery 
as a result of this change  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience a short term negative impact on our cash flow from operations 
however  we believe that this practice will ultimately favorably impact service revenues and cash flow 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities dollars in thousands as of september  september  percent change cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities including short and long term working capital the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities was due primarily to cash paid for acquired businesses  repurchases of common stock and investments made towards the implementation of our new information technology system  infrastructure improvements and software development projects 
these investments were partially offset by cash generated from operations and cash proceeds from stock option exercises 
cash flow highlights dollars in thousands fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal cash provided by operations cash used for property  plant and equipment cash used for acquisitions of businesses decreases increases in marketable securities net proceeds from exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plans repurchases of common stock the decrease in cash provided by operations in fiscal was primarily attributable to decreases in deferred professional services revenues due to the impact of billing our customers in arrears for professional services as the services are delivered and a reduction in deferred product revenues due to the recognition of revenue on certain customer arrangements 
these factors were partially offset by an increase in net income and an increase in taxes payable 
the increase in cash provided by operations in fiscal was principally attributable to an increase in net income  an increased rate of growth in our deferred product and maintenance revenues and an increased rate of growth of accounts payable and accrued expenses due to the timing of vendor payments and incentive payments 
these were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable during fiscal as compared to the same period in the prior year  which was attributable to an increase in sales volume associated with trade accounts receivable and financing arrangements beyond one year 
the accounts receivable balance from the prior year benefited from significant collection efforts  which offset any increases related to sales volume 
a decrease in the rate of growth in our deferred professional services revenues further offset the increases in net income  deferred product and maintenance revenue  and accounts payable and accrued expenses discussed above 
this decrease was attributable to an increase in our practice of billing customers in arrears as professional services are delivered rather than billing customers in advance of service delivery 
our use of cash for property  plant and equipment in both fiscal and includes investments in information systems and infrastructure to improve and support expanding operations 
we anticipate that we will continue to make significant capital investments during fiscal in conjunction with the replacement of information technology systems 
to date  we have invested approximately million excluding internal personnel related costs related to this project  of which million has been capitalized  with the remainder expensed through operations 
we expect our total investment in this project excluding internal personnel related costs to range between million and million through the end of fiscal our use of cash for the acquisition of businesses in fiscal was principally related to the acquisitions of ad opt technologies inc on november   nextime  inc on february   and ctr systems time and attendance  inc on september  please refer to note i in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for further details 
we are assessing several other acquisition opportunities that may be completed over the next twelve months  although there can be no assurance that these acquisitions will be completed 
excess cash reserves not required for operations  investments in property  plant and equipment or acquisitions are invested in marketable securities 
stock repurchases under stock repurchase program dollars in thousands fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal shares of common stock repurchased cost of shares of common stock repurchased the common stock repurchased under our stock repurchase program is used to partially cover the shares required for our employee stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we received million upon the maturity of a call option arrangement 
since the first quarter of fiscal  we have not had any outstanding call option arrangements 
we lease certain office space  manufacturing facilities and equipment under long term operating lease agreements 
in addition  certain acquisition agreements contain provisions that require us to make a guaranteed payment and or contingent payments based upon profitability of the business unit or if specified minimum revenue requirements are met 
future minimum rental commitments under operating leases  and future payment obligations related to guaranteed payments are as follows payments due by period dollars in thousands contractual obligations total less than year more than year  less than years more than years  less than years more than years operating lease obligations guaranteed payment obligations total we believe that we have adequate cash and investments and operating cash flow to fund our investments in property  plant and equipment  software development costs  cash requirements under operating leases  cash payments related to acquisitions  if any  and any additional stock repurchases for the foreseeable future 
certain factors that may affect future operating results except for historical matters  the matters discussed in this annual report on form k are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of we desire to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of and include this statement for the express purpose of availing ourselves of the protection of the safe harbor with respect to all forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual operating results may differ from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by us from time to time because of a number of factors including the potential fluctuations in quarterly results  timing and acceptance of new product introductions by us and our competitors  the dependence on our time and labor product line  the ability to attract and retain sufficient technical personnel  the protection of our intellectual property and the potential infringement on our intellectual property rights  competitive pricing pressure and the dependence on alternate distribution channels and on key vendors  as further described below 
potential fluctuations in results 
our operating results  including revenue growth  sources of revenue  effective tax rate and liquidity  may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  including general economic conditions and related effects on workforce size  the purchasing patterns of our customers  the diversion of public companies resources to address compliance with new regulatory requirements on internal controls  the mix of products and services sold  the ability to effectively integrate acquired businesses into our operations  the timing of the introduction of new products and product enhancements by us and our competitors  the strategy employed by us in the human resources and payroll market  market acceptance of new products and competitive pricing pressure 
we historically have realized a relatively larger percentage of our annual revenues and profits in the third and fourth quarters and a relatively smaller percentage in the first and second quarters of each fiscal year  although there can be no assurance that this pattern will continue 
in addition  substantially all of our product revenue and profits in each quarter result from orders received in that quarter 
if near term demand for our products weakens or if significant anticipated sales in any quarter do not close when expected  our revenues for that quarter will be adversely affected 
we believe that our operating results for any one period are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
new information technology system implementation 
we completed the first phase of the implementation of our new information technology system in april  and therefore have begun incurring certain recurring costs that were not incurred prior to completion of this first phase  including amortization and depreciation related costs 
during the implementation of and transition to our new information technology systems we may experience some short term erosion to our productivity resulting from duplicate data entry  troubleshooting and mitigation of any issues related to the rollout of these systems as well as increased costs related to the completion of the implementation  which may have an impact on our cash flows 
integration of acquired businesses 
as part of our overall growth strategy  we acquire from time to time resellers of our products and  in certain instances  complementary business lines 
even if we are successful in identifying and acquiring businesses strategic to us  these acquisition activities involve a number of risks  including we may find the acquired business does not further our business strategy  that we overpaid for the company or the economic assumptions underlying our acquisition decision have changed or were not accurate  difficulties integrating the acquired companies products and services and customer base with our existing product and service offerings  difficulties integrating the operations  technology and personnel of the acquired company  or retaining the key personnel of the acquired company critical to its continued operation and success  disruption of our ongoing business and diversion of management s attention by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically or culturally diverse enterprises  difficulties maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies across locations and businesses  litigation by terminated employees or third parties  and problems or liabilities associated with product quality  technology and legal contingencies relating to the acquired business or technology  such as intellectual property matters 
these and other factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or multiple acquisitions in a short period of time 
acquisitions may also have a negative effect on our earnings per share 
if we were to proceed with one or more significant acquisitions or investments in which the consideration included cash  we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash to consummate such acquisition or investment 
to the extent we issue shares of our capital stock or other rights to purchase our capital stock  including options and warrants  existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease 
in addition  acquisitions and investments may result in the incurrence of debt  large one time write offs  such as acquired in process research and development costs  and restructuring charges 
they may also result in goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment tests  which could result in future impairment charges 
changes in stock option accounting rules may have a significant adverse affect on our operating results 
we have a history of using broad based employee stock option programs to hire  incentivize and retain our workforce in a competitive marketplace 
statement allows companies the choice of either using a fair value method of accounting for options that would result in expense recognition for all options granted  or using an intrinsic value method  as prescribed by opinion no 
 with pro forma disclosure of the impact on net income of using the fair value option exercise recognition method 
we have previously elected to apply opinion no 
and accordingly  we have not recognized any compensation expense with respect to employee stock options 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement r  which would require all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments  including employee stock options  at fair value 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  adoption of statement r will result in the recognition of stock compensation expense 
we adopted statement r on october   the beginning of our fiscal year 
the actual impact on future years will depend on a number of factors  including our stock price and the level of future grants and awards made from our stock based compensation plans 
if we had used the fair value method to measure compensation related to stock awards to employees  we would have incurred stock based compensation expense 
refer to note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for further details on the pro forma net income and stock compensation expense for fiscal  and the pro forma effects for fiscal  and are not necessarily representative of the effects on the results of operations in the future 
competition 
the workforce management market  which includes time and labor  scheduling  human resources and payroll  is highly competitive 
technological changes such as those allowing for increased use of the internet have resulted in new entrants into the market 
increased competition could adversely affect our operating results through price reductions or loss of market share 
with our efforts to expand our workforce management offering with the introduction of our human resources and payroll product suite and the expansion of our scheduling product offerings  we will continue to meet strong competition 
many of these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their human resources and payroll products 
many of our human resources and payroll competitors have significantly greater financial  technical and sales and marketing resources than us  as well as more experience in delivering human resources and payroll solutions 
although we believe our organization has core competencies that position us strongly in the marketplace  maintaining our technological and other advantages over competitors will require continued investment in research and development as well as marketing and sales programs 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments or be able to achieve the technological advances necessary to maintain our competitive advantages 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the human resources and payroll marketplace  and our failure to do so could have a material adverse impact on our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results 
dependence on time and labor product line 
to date  the substantial majority of our revenues have been attributable to sales of time and labor systems and related services 
although we have introduced products for scheduling solutions and the licensed human resources and payroll market  we expect that our dependence on the time and labor product line for revenues will continue for the foreseeable future 
competitive pressures or other factors could cause our time and labor products to lose market acceptance or experience significant price erosion  adversely affecting the results of our operations 
product development and technological change 
continual change and improvement in computer software and hardware technology characterize the markets for workforce management systems 
our future success will depend largely on our ability to enhance the capabilities and increase the performance of our existing products and to develop new products and interfaces to third party products on a timely basis to meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
although we are continually seeking to further enhance our workforce management offerings and to develop new products and interfaces  there can be no assurance that these efforts will succeed  or that  if successful  such product enhancements or new products will achieve widespread market acceptance  or that our competitors will not develop and market products that are superior to our products or achieve greater market acceptance 
dependence on alternate distribution channels 
we market and sell our products through our direct sales organization  independent resellers and adp under an original equipment manufacturer agreement 
in fiscal  approximately of our revenue was generated through sales to resellers and adp 
a reduction in the sales efforts of either our major resellers or adp  or termination or changes in their relationships with us  could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations 
attracting and retaining sufficient technical personnel for product development  support and sales 
we have encountered intense competition for experienced technical personnel for product development  technical support and sales and expect such competition to continue in the future 
any inability to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified technical personnel could adversely affect our ability to produce  support and sell products in a timely manner 
protection of intellectual property 
we have developed  and through our acquisitions of businesses and software  acquired  proprietary technology and intellectual property rights 
our success is dependent upon our ability to further develop and protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights 
we seek to protect products  software  documentation and other written materials primarily through a combination of trade secret  patent  trademark and copyright laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions 
while we have attempted to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights  it is unknown whether we have been or will be successful in doing so 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that is regarded as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult 
while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we can offer no assurance that we can adequately protect our proprietary rights or that our competitors will not reverse engineer or independently develop similar technology 
infringement of intellectual property rights 
we cannot provide assurance that others will not claim that our developed or acquired intellectual property rights infringe on their intellectual property rights or that we do not in fact infringe on those intellectual property rights 
any litigation regarding intellectual property rights could be costly and time consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from business operations 
the complexity of the technology involved in our products and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks 
claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements  and in this event  we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on acceptable terms  if at all 
we may also be subject to significant damages or an injunction against the use of our products 
a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could cause immediate and substantial damage to our business and financial condition 
additional stock option program information stock award program description 
we intend that our stock award program be our primary vehicle for offering long term incentives and rewarding executives and key employees 
awards are granted to key employees based upon prior performance  the importance of our retaining their services and the potential for their performance to help us attain our long term goals 
however  there is no set formula for the granting of awards to individual executives or employees 
awards are generally granted annually in conjunction with the compensation committee s formal review of the individual performance of key executives  including our executive chairman and chief executive officer  and their contributions to our company 
in fiscal  the awards took the form of stock options and of the options granted went to employees other than our named executive officers as set forth in the table below 
all the awards are granted from our stock incentive plan 
options  which are granted at the fair market value on the date of grant  typically vest in four equal annual installments beginning one year from the date of grant and typically have a contractual life of four years and six months

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our investments and foreign currency fluctuations 
refer to note a  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for further discussion regarding marketable securities and foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
our marketable securities that expose us to market rate risks are comprised of debt securities 
a decrease in interest rates would not adversely impact interest income or related cash flows pertaining to securities held at september   as all of these securities have fixed rates of interest 
a basis point increase in interest rates would not adversely impact the fair value of these securities by a material amount due to the size and average duration of the portfolio 
our exposure to market risk for fluctuations in foreign currency relate primarily to the amounts due from subsidiaries 
exchange gains and losses related to amounts due from subsidiaries have not been material to date 
for foreign currency exposures existing at september   a unfavorable movement in the foreign exchange rates for each subsidiary location would not expose us to material losses in earnings or cash flows 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar
