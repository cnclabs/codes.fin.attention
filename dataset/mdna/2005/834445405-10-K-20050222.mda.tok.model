results of operations overview we develop  manufacture and market the invos cerebral oximeter  the only non invasive patient monitoring system commercially available in the united states that continuously measures changes in the blood oxygen level in the brain 
we also develop and market the correstore system for use in cardiac repair and reconstruction  including heart surgeries called surgical ventricular restoration  or svr 
in june  we entered into a license agreement for the correstore system 
in november we received clearance from the fda to market the correstore patch in the united states  and in april we met the requirements under the european medical device directive to use the ce mark  thereby allowing us to market the product in the european economic community 
in september  the european economic community changed its regulations  limiting approval authority for animal tissue implant products sold in europe to some independent registration agencies that do not include our registrar 
we are currently evaluating new registrars to obtain approval to allow us to use the ce mark and resume sales of the correstore system in europe 
during fiscal  and  our primary activities consisted of sales and marketing of the cerebral oximeter  the related disposable somasensor  and the correstore system 
we derive our revenues from sales of cerebral oximeters  somasensors and correstore systems to our distributors and to hospitals in the united states through our direct sales employees and independent sales representative firms 
we offer to our customers in the united states a no cap sales program whereby we ship the cerebral oximeter to the customer at no charge  in exchange for the customer agreeing to purchase somasensors 
we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer  the product has been delivered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the product is considered delivered to the customer once we have shipped it  as this is when title and risk of loss have transferred 
payment terms are generally net days for united states sales and net days or longer for international sales 
our primary expenses  excluding the cost of our products  are selling  general and administrative and research  development and engineering 
as described in more detail below  we achieved net income before income taxes for fiscal of approximately  our net income before income taxes for the year ended november  was primarily a result of our increase in net revenues and a seven percentage point increase in gross margin percentage 
our increase in net revenues was primarily a result of increased unit sales and increased average selling prices for our disposable somasensor in the united states 
our increase in gross margin percentage was also primarily attributable to the increase in average selling prices for our disposable somasensors  as well as the reduction in the cost of our disposable somasensor by approximately  effective may  as a result of changes in our manufacturing process 
our operating expenses increased approximately for the fiscal year ended november  primarily due to increased commissions paid to our independent sales representative firms and direct sales employees as a result of increased sales  and increased salaries as a result of our hiring additional direct sales personnel in fiscal as of november   we adjusted our deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting in the recognition of a deferred tax asset of approximately  due to expected future tax benefits related to our net operating loss carryforwards 
recognition of this deferred tax asset resulted in a non cash tax benefit on our statement of operations for fiscal  and increased our net income for fiscal to approximately  or 
per diluted common share 
we had approximately  of cash provided by operations in fiscal  and a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of approximately  primarily as a result of the exercise of stock options and warrants  in addition to our net income before taxes 
for  we project an increase in net revenues of approximately to  and an increase in our gross margin percentage to approximately 
in addition  we project an increase in net income before income taxes of approximately to  to approximately million to million 
we expect our operating expenses to increase in fiscal  primarily as a result of our hiring additional direct sales personnel and increasing our expenses associated with the sales and marketing of our products 
we project our year end fiscal cash balance will be approximately  while we do not expect to pay income taxes for fiscal  beginning in the first quarter of  we will be recognizing income tax expense at the statutory rate of on our statement of operations 
as progresses and we assess our plans for future years  we will review the appropriateness of adjusting our deferred tax asset valuation allowance and recognizing additional deferred tax assets 
fiscal year ended november  compared to fiscal year ended november  our net revenues increased  or  from  in the fiscal year ended november  to  in the fiscal year ended november  the increase in net revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in united states sales of approximately  or  from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal the increase in united states sales was primarily due to an increase in sales of the disposable somasensor of approximately  or  as a result of a increase in somasensor unit sales and a increase in somasensor average selling prices 
in addition  sales of the cerebral oximeter in the united states increased approximately  or  as a result of increased purchases by pediatric hospitals 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in correstore system revenues of approximately  or  and an increase in international sales of approximately  or  from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal  primarily due to increased purchases of the cerebral oximeter and disposable somasensor by edwards lifesciences in japan  partially offset by decreased purchases by tyco healthcare in europe 
as described above  during fiscal we achieved a increase in the average selling price of somasensors in the united states 
this increase in our average selling prices is attributable to the addition of new customers at our higher suggested retail prices  which were effective september   increased sales of our small adult somasensor that was launched in the third quarter of fiscal and sells for a premium price compared to the adult somasensor  increased sales of our pediatric somasensor which also sells for a higher price than the adult somasensor  and the upgrade of certain customers to our most recent model cerebral oximeter in exchange for the customer agreeing to pay a higher price for the disposable somasensor 
in addition  as described above  we had a increase in somasensor unit sales in the united states to  units 
we expect that the average selling price of somasensors in the united states will increase by approximately in fiscal  as a result of the factors described above 
we placed cerebral oximeters in the united states and internationally in fiscal  and our installed base of cerebral oximeters in the united states is approximately  in hospitals  as of november  approximately of our net revenues in fiscal were export sales  compared to approximately of our net revenues in fiscal one international distributor accounted for approximately of net revenues in fiscal for fiscal  we expect international net revenues will continue to represent approximately to of our total net revenues 
sales of our products as a percentage of net revenues were as follows percent of net revenue fiscal year ended november  product somasensors cerebral oximeters correstore systems total for fiscal  we expect sales of somasensors to account for to of net revenues  sales of cerebral oximeters to  and sales of correstore systems less than 
gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was approximately for the fiscal year ended november  and approximately for the fiscal year ended november  the increase in gross margin as a percentage of net revenues is primarily attributable to a change in the sales mix with increased sales of the disposable somasensor  which has a higher gross margin than the cerebral oximeter or correstore system  the increase in the average selling price of somasensors described above  a reduction in the cost of our somasensor by approximately  in may  as a result of changes in our manufacturing process  and the change in sales mix with increased sales in the united states  which have higher gross margins than our international sales to distributors 
we expect our gross margin percentage in fiscal to increase to approximately  primarily due to our expected increase in the average selling price of the disposable somasensor in the united states described above  and sales of our new cost reduced somasensor for all of fiscal  compared with approximately half of fiscal our research  development and engineering expenses decreased approximately  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to approximately  in decreased costs associated with the development of the correstore system and approximately  in decreased costs associated with the development of the cerebral oximeter  partially offset by increased costs associated with the development of the disposable somasensor and increased engineering salaries 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately  or  from  for the fiscal year ended november  to  for the fiscal year ended november  the increase in selling  general and administrative expense is primarily attributable to a  increase in salaries  wages and related expenses  primarily as a result of an increase in the number of employees  principally sales and marketing from an average of employees for the fiscal year ended november  to an average of employees for the fiscal year ended november   a  increase in employee sales commissions as a result of increased sales and increased sales headcount during fiscal  a  increase in commissions paid to our independent sales representative firms as a result of increased sales  a  increase in accrued incentive compensation expense due to our fiscal financial performance  primarily increased sales and net income  in accordance with the incentive compensation plan  a  increase in travel and selling related expenses as a result of our increased sales headcount and increased sales and marketing activities   in costs associated with a k matching contribution program that we implemented in fiscal  and  in costs associated with the termination of some of our independent sales representative firms in the second quarter of fiscal these increases were partially offset by a  decrease in customer education expenses for the correstore system 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in fiscal  primarily as a result of our hiring additional direct sales personnel in fiscal and  increased sales commissions payable to our independent sales representative firms and increased sales and marketing expenses 
as of november   we adjusted our deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting in the recognition of a deferred tax asset of approximately  as a result of expected future tax benefits related to our net operating loss carryforwards 
recognition of this deferred tax asset resulted in a non cash tax benefit on our statement of operations for fiscal  and increased our net income for fiscal to approximately  or 
per diluted common share 
fiscal year ended november  compared to fiscal year ended november  our net revenues increased approximately  or  from  in the fiscal year ended november  to  in the fiscal year ended november  the increase in net revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in united states sales of approximately  or  from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal  primarily due to an increase in sales of the disposable somasensor of approximately  or  and an increase in correstore system revenues of approximately  or  an increase in international sales of approximately  or  from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal  primarily due to increased purchases of the cerebral oximeter and disposable somasensor by tyco healthcare in europe and edwards lifesciences in japan  and a increase in the average selling price of somasensors in the united states  primarily as a result of the increase in the suggested retail price of the somasensor effective december   the addition of new customers during at the higher suggested retail prices  and increased sales of somasensors to larger united states hospitals at a premium price pursuant to our no cap sales program 
this increase was partially offset by increased somasensor sales to international distributors  which have lower average selling prices 
sales of our products as a percentage of net revenues were as follows percent of net revenue fiscal year ended november  product somasensors cerebral oximeters correstore systems total approximately of our net revenues in fiscal were export sales  compared to approximately of our net revenues in fiscal one international distributor accounted for approximately of net revenues for each of the fiscal years ended november  and november  effective september   we increased the suggested list price for the adult somasensor and the pediatric somasensor in the united states to and  respectively 
in addition  we launched our new small adult somasensor  designed for use on patients with smaller foreheads or lower hairlines  with a suggested list price of 
gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was approximately for the fiscal year ended november  and approximately for the fiscal year ended november  the increase in gross margin as a percentage of net revenues is primarily attributable to the increase in the average selling price of somasensors in the united states described above  increased sales of our latest model somasensor  which is less costly to manufacture than the prior model somasensor sold in fiscal  sales of our latest model cerebral oximeter  which was launched in  and is less costly to manufacture than the model sold in fiscal  and increased sales of the correstore system in fiscal our research  development and engineering expenses decreased approximately  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to approximately  in decreased costs associated with the development of the correstore system and approximately  in decreased costs associated with the development of the cerebral oximeter 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately  or  from  for the fiscal year ended november  to  for the fiscal year ended november  the increase in selling  general and administrative expense is primarily attributable to a  increase in commissions paid to our independent sales representative firms as a result of increased sales and additional independent representative firms  a  increase in incentive compensation expense due to increased sales  net income  and our executive officers receiving awards under the incentive compensation plan after forgoing awards under the incentive compensation plan  a  increase in salaries  wages  commissions and related expenses  primarily as a result of increased salaries  principally sales and marketing  and increased employee insurance costs  a  increase in trade show  promotional  and selling related expenses as a result of our increased sales and marketing activities  and a  increase in royalty expense due to increased sales of the correstore system 
effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations in the past three years 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operations during fiscal was approximately  cash was provided primarily by our net income before income taxes of approximately  and depreciation and amortization expense of approximately  and a  increase in accrued liabilities  primarily as a result of the increased accrued incentive compensation and accrued k matching contribution described above 
cash provided by operations was partially offset by a  increase in inventories  primarily due to the acquisition of somasensors and components associated with our cerebral oximeter due to anticipated sales  inventories on our balance sheet declined because we capitalized cerebral oximeters to property and equipment that are being used as demonstration units and no cap sales equipment  as described below  a  increase in prepaid expenses  primarily due to the timing of the renewal of our products liability insurance  and a  decrease in accounts payable  primarily as a result of more timely payments made to vendors 
we expect our working capital requirements to increase as sales increase 
we capitalized approximately  of costs from inventory for cerebral oximeters being used as demonstration units and no cap sales equipment at customers during fiscal  compared to approximately  in fiscal as of november   we have capitalized approximately  in costs for cerebral oximeters being used as demonstration and no cap sales equipment  and these assets have a net book value of approximately  we depreciate these assets over five years 
in addition  we had capital expenditures in fiscal of approximately  these expenditures were primarily for computer equipment and tooling for our somasensor 
our principal sources of operating funds have been the proceeds of equity investments from sales of our common shares and  in  cash provided by operating activities 
see statements of shareholders equity of our financial statements included in item of this report 
on march   we entered into the private equity line agreement with kingsbridge capital limited  a private institutional investor  which was subsequently terminated on april  in connection with the private equity line agreement  we issued to kingsbridge capital warrants which entitled the holder to purchase  common shares  after adjustment for the april private placement and the january public offering  at a purchase price of per share 
the exercise price of the warrants was payable either in cash or by a cashless exercise 
in november  kingsbridge purchased  common shares under the warrants by a cashless exercise 
as a result of this cashless exercise  we issued  common shares to kingsbridge  retaining  common shares in payment of the exercise price 
in march  kingsbridge capital limited purchased  common shares under its warrants by a cashless exercise 
as a result of this cashless exercise  we issued  common shares to kingsbridge  retaining  common shares in payment of the exercise price 
in may  kingsbridge capital limited purchased the remaining  common shares under its warrants by a cashless exercise 
as a result of this cashless exercise  we issued  common shares to kingsbridge  retaining  common shares in payment of the exercise price 
kingsbridge now has no warrants remaining to purchase common shares 
on april   we completed a private placement of newly issued common shares for which brean murray co  inc  as our exclusive placement agent  received warrants to purchase  common shares at per share 
in october  brean murray co  inc transferred the  warrants to persons who are or were employees of brean murray co  inc  and in november  those persons exercised the warrants to purchase all  common shares under the warrants by a cashless exercise 
as a result of this cashless exercise  we issued  restricted common shares to those individuals  retaining  common shares in payment of the exercise price  and no more common shares remain subject to these warrants 
on january   we completed a public offering of newly issued common shares for which brean murray co  inc  as our exclusive placement agent  received warrants to purchase  common shares at per share 
in june  brean murray co  inc purchased  common shares under its warrants by a cashless exercise 
as a result of this cashless exercise  we issued  common shares to brean murray co  inc  retaining  common shares in payment of the exercise price 
brean murray co  inc now has no warrants remaining to purchase common shares 
in april  correstore llc exercised its warrant to purchase  of our newly issued common shares  at per share  for proceeds of  during fiscal  we issued  common shares as a result of stock option exercises by employees  directors and former employees  for proceeds of approximately  during fiscal  we issued  common shares as a result of stock option exercises by employees  directors and former employees  for proceeds of approximately  as of november   we had working capital of  cash and cash equivalents of  total current liabilities of  and shareholders equity of  we had an accumulated deficit of  through november  we expect that our primary needs for liquidity in fiscal will be to fund our operations  including funding for marketing costs for the cerebral oximeter and the correstore system  and research and development efforts for the cerebral oximeter related to newborns  for monitoring non brain tissues and other advances to the design and performance features of the cerebral oximeter and disposable somasensor  and for working capital  primarily accounts receivable and inventory  as our sales increase 
in addition  we have budgeted approximately  during fiscal for capitalizing cerebral oximeters and capital expenditures  primarily for new demonstration and no cap sales equipment at customers  and tooling for the cerebral oximeter and disposable somasensor 
we believe that the cash and cash equivalents on hand at november  will be adequate to satisfy our operating and capital requirements for more than the next twelve months 
the estimated length of time current cash and cash equivalents will sustain our operations is based on estimates and assumptions we have made 
these estimates and assumptions are subject to change as a result of actual experience 
actual funding requirements necessary to market the cerebral oximeter  the disposable somasensor  and the correstore system  to undertake other product development activities  and for working capital might be substantially greater than current estimates 
our ability to use our accumulated net operating loss carryforwards to offset future income  if any  for income tax purposes  is limited due to the initial public offering of our securities in march see note of notes to financial statements included in item of this report 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment 
this statement  which is effective for interim or annual reporting periods that begin after june   revises statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and requires that compensation costs related to share based payment transactions  including stock options  be recognized in the financial statements 
this statement will be effective for our fiscal quarter ending november  we expect the equity compensation to be recognized in our statement of operations for fiscal  related to unvested stock options as of our required adoption date  will be the equivalent of 
per diluted common share  and we expect the impact for fiscal will be approximately 
per diluted common share 
the future approval of any additional equity incentive plans would have an additional impact on our financial statements 
critical accounting policies we believe our most significant accounting policies relate to the recording of an intangible asset for license acquisition costs related to our acquisition of exclusive  worldwide  royalty bearing licenses to specified rights relating to the correstore system and related products and accessories  our accounting treatment of stock options issued to employees  our accounting treatment for income taxes  and our revenue recognition associated with our no cap sales program 
in fiscal years   and  we recorded an intangible asset related to our acquisition of exclusive  worldwide  royalty bearing licenses to specified rights relating to the correstore system and related products and accessories 
license acquisition costs include our estimate of the fair value of ten year vested stock options to purchase common shares granted to one of our then current directors in connection with negotiating and assisting us in completing the transaction  and our estimate of the fair value of the vested portion of five year warrants to purchase common shares issued in the transaction 
we estimated the value of the stock options to purchase common shares and the warrants to purchase common shares using the black scholes valuation model 
the black scholes valuation model requires the following assumptions expected life period of the security  expected volatility of our stock price during the period  risk free interest rate  and dividend yield 
given the assumptions inherent in the black scholes valuation model  it would have been possible to calculate a different value for our intangible asset by changing one or more of the valuation model variables or by using a different valuation model 
however  we believe that the model is appropriate  that the judgments and assumptions that we have made at the time of valuation were also appropriate  and that the reported results would not be materially different had one or more of the variables been different or had a different valuation model been used 
we have adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets 
the effect of adopting this statement has been to discontinue amortizing our license acquisition costs related to our acquisition of exclusive  worldwide  royalty bearing licenses to specified rights relating to the correstore system and related products and accessories described above because we believe these licenses have an indefinite life 
therefore  we recorded no amortization expense related to these license acquisition costs in fiscal  or it is possible to determine a different life for these licenses  and if they had a definite life we would amortize the intangible asset over the remaining useful life 
however  we believe it is appropriate to use an indefinite life for these licenses 
indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment at the end of our fiscal year  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered 
we evaluate impairment by comparing the fair value of the intangible asset  determined using a cash flow method  with its carrying value 
in october  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  was issued 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment 
this statement  which is effective for interim or annual reporting periods that begin after june   revises statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and requires that compensation costs related to share based payment transactions  including stock options  stock appreciation rights and restricted stock be recognized in the financial statements 
this statement will be effective for our fiscal quarter ending november  we currently account for stock based compensation of employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
accordingly  compensation costs for stock options granted to employees are measured as the excess  if any  of the market price of our stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
no compensation expense has been charged against income for stock option grants to employees because our stock option grants are priced at the market value as of the date of grant 
stock based compensation of consultants and advisors is determined based on the fair value of the options or warrants on the grant date pursuant to the methodology of sfas no 
 estimated using the black scholes model 
the resulting amount is recognized as compensation expense and an increase in additional paid in capital over the vesting period of the options or warrants 
as a result  we recorded  of compensation expense  and an equal increase in additional paid in capital  for stock options issued to non employees in fiscal  and  of compensation expense in fiscal we recorded no such expense in fiscal during fiscal  we granted  stock options to our employees and directors  in fiscal we granted  stock options to our employees and directors  and in fiscal we granted  stock options to our employees and directors 
had we recognized compensation expense for our stock options granted to employees and directors in fiscal  using the fair value method of accounting based on the fair value of the options on the grant date using the black scholes valuation model  we would have recorded approximately  in compensation expense and realized pro forma net income of approximately  or 
per diluted common share 
for fiscal  had we recognized compensation expense for stock options granted to employees and directors  using the fair value method of accounting based on the fair value of the options on the grant date using the black scholes valuation model  we would have recorded approximately  in compensation expense and incurred a pro forma net loss of approximately  or 
per diluted common share 
for fiscal  had we recognized compensation expense for stock options granted to employees and directors  using the fair value method of accounting based on the fair value of the options on the grant date using the black scholes valuation model  we would have recorded approximately  in compensation expense and increased our pro forma net loss to  or 
per diluted common share 
we have adjusted our deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting in the recognition of a deferred tax asset of  related to the expected future benefits of our net operating loss carryforwards  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we have performed the required assessment of positive and negative evidence regarding realization of our deferred tax assets in accordance with sfas no 
 including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses over our history up to the most recent two fiscal years  and our forecast for future net income 
our assessment of our deferred tax assets  and the reversal of part of our valuation allowance  included evaluating our financial plans and our future projected earnings  making allowance for the uncertainties surrounding  among other things  our future rate of growth in net revenues  the rate of adoption of our products in the marketplace  and the potential for competition to enter the marketplace 
in reversing a portion of our valuation allowance  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized 
the effect of recognizing this asset on our balance sheet  and associated tax benefit on our statement of operations  is to increase our net income for fiscal to approximately  or 
per diluted common share 
given the assumptions inherent in our financial plans  it is possible to calculate a different value for our deferred tax asset by changing one or more of the variables in our assessment 
however  we believe that our evaluation of our financial plans was reasonable  and that the judgments and assumptions that we made at the time of developing the plan were appropriate 
we offer to our customers in the united states a no cap sales program whereby we ship the cerebral oximeter to the customer at no charge  in exchange for the customer agreeing to purchase somasensors 
we recognize somasensor revenue when we receive purchase orders and ship the product to the customer 
we do not recognize any revenue upon the initial shipment of the cerebral oximeter to the customer at no charge 
at the time of shipment  we capitalize the cerebral oximeter as an asset and depreciate this asset over five years 
we believe this is consistent with our stated revenue recognition policy  which is compliant with staff accounting bulletin no 
and emerging issues task force no
