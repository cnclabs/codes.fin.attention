general we derive our revenues from delivering comprehensive business process outsourcing and information technology outsourcing solutions to commercial and government clients 
a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from recurring monthly charges to our clients under service contracts with initial terms that vary from one to ten years 
we define recurring revenues as revenues derived from services that our clients use each year in connection with their ongoing businesses  and accordingly  exclude software license fees  short term contract programming and consulting engagements  product installation fees  and hardware and software sales 
however  as we add  through acquisition or new service offerings  consulting or other services to enhance the value delivered and offered to our clients which are primarily short term in nature  we may experience variations in our mix of recurring versus non recurring revenues 
since inception  our acquisition program has resulted in growth and diversification of our client base  expansion of services and products offered  increased economies of scale and geographic expansion 
outlook as a leading provider of both information technology and business process outsourcing services  we believe we are well positioned to benefit from commercial and governmental entities demand to outsource non core  mission critical back office functions 
demand for commercial business process and information technology outsourcing services is expected to remain healthy during fiscal year areas of strong demand in the commercial segment include human resources outsourcing  finance and accounting outsourcing  customer care and traditional it outsourcing 
we also anticipate an improving demand environment for our government services 
in addition to the areas that we have marketed historically  such as government healthcare  municipal services and transportation services and solutions  we also believe that government entities could benefit from our commercial best practices around such areas as human resources outsourcing  customer care and finance and accounting outsourcing 
from a geographic perspective  we believe that there will continue to be strong demand in the united states and expect to see more business process outsourcing opportunities in europe and abroad 

table of contents in order to capitalize on the opportunities in these markets  we will make certain investments and reorganizations in our business 
we recently completed strategic acquisitions in the human resource outsourcing  customer care and commercial healthcare markets  which should allow us to capitalize on strong demand in these vertical markets 
we reorganized our government segment during fiscal year to better leverage our government client relationships  multiple service offerings and subject matter experts

there are no third party standards or requirements governing the calculation of new business signings or total contract value 
we define new business signings as recurring revenue from new contracts  including the incremental portion of renewals  signed during the period and represents the estimated first twelve months of revenue to be recorded under that contract after full implementation 
we use new business signings as a measure of estimated recurring revenues represented by contractual commitments  both to forecast prospective revenues and to estimate capital commitments 
we define total contract value as the estimated total revenues from contracts signed during the period and represents estimated total revenue over the term of the contract 
we use total contract value as an additional measure of estimating total revenue represented by contractual commitments  both to forecast prospective revenues and to estimate capital commitments 
revenues for both new business signings and total contract value are measured under gaap

on january   an administrative law judge made a non binding recommendation to sustain eds protest of the contract between us and the dhhs 
notwithstanding the reviews  approvals  and decisions in awarding the contract and in considering the protests  the administrative law judge based his recommendation on his assessment that our technical solution did not fully comply with the dhhs technical standards for proposals

a hearing was held before the cio on march  during which each of the parties presented oral arguments 
on april   the cio issued a decision in favor of the dhhs and us as to the issues of i the sufficiency of our technical solution  ii our satisfaction of rfp requirements relative to our integrated testing facility  and iii whether the state s evaluation was consistent with the rfp s evaluation criteria 
however  his ruling also found insufficient evidence or argument had been submitted to address three other issues raised by eds in its initial protest filing 
therefore  the cio has directed that a hearing be conducted on the issues of whether a our proposal complied with rfp requirements relative to experience of proposed key personnel  b our proposal complied with rfp requirements for pricing  and c any perceived price advantage is illusory and in any event was miscalculated by dhhs 
eds subsequently waived its right to a hearing before the cio on these three remaining issues and  on may   eds appealed the cio s decision to wake county superior court

table of contents percentage of completion estimates on the georgia contract primarily as a result of the termination of phase ii of the contract  which was recognized in the second quarter of fiscal year internal revenue growth  excluding the impact of the revenues related to the divestitures  was  due primarily to increased revenue in our texas medicaid  department of education  new jersey e zpass  florida medicaid  georgia healthcare partnership  ohio and illinois child support payment processing contracts  and higher non recurring revenues related to our government unclaimed property business and hipaa remediation work 
these revenues collectively represent of the internal growth for the period in this segment 
the remaining of total revenue growth is from acquisitions 
operating expense wages and benefits increased million  or  to billion 
as a percentage of revenues  wages and benefits decreased to 
included in fiscal year wages and benefits were compensation costs of million associated with former federal employees  which were primarily stay bonuses and accelerated option vesting due to the divested federal business 
excluding these costs  wages and benefits increased million  or in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year calculated as the million increase less million compensation costs  divided by reported fiscal year wages and benefits costs and therefore decreased to as a percentage of revenue 
the sale of the divested federal business and the acquisition of lockheed martin corporation s commercial information outsourcing business were primarily responsible for the decrease in labor costs as a percentage of revenue 
the divested federal business  which provided primarily system integration services to the federal government and its agencies  had a higher proportion of labor related expenses to its revenues 
in addition  the acquisition of lockheed martin corporation s commercial information technology outsourcing business had a lower proportion of labor costs as a percentage of revenue than business process outsourcing 
services and supplies increased million  or  to billion 
as a percentage of revenues  services and supplies increased to in fiscal year this percentage increase is primarily due to million of wind down costs related to the termination of phase ii of the georgia contract discussed earlier 
rent  lease and maintenance expense increased million  or  to million 
as a percentage of revenue  rent  lease and maintenance increased to 
this increase was primarily due to the sale of our divested federal business in fiscal year  which provided primarily system integration services to its clients 
these services typically have a lower percentage of rent  lease and maintenance than our information technology services  which have higher equipment costs 
gain on sale of business was million  or  of revenues for fiscal year this gain was related to the sale of our divested federal business  as discussed above 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or to million 
depreciation and amortization expense was positively impacted by approximately million in fiscal year as a result of the cessation of depreciation and amortization related to the assets held for sale in our divested federal business 
as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization increased  to  due to million of capital expenditures and additions to intangible assets  offset by the sale of the divested federal business  which had a lower percentage of depreciation and amortization to revenue than our remaining business  and the cessation of depreciation and amortization 
other operating expenses increased million  or to million 
as a percentage of revenue  other operating expenses increased to primarily as a result of the previously discussed million legal settlement with former employees of gibraltar savings association and or first texas savings association and the million settlement with the dch discussed earlier  offset by the million gain on the sale of the hanscom contracts 
interest expense interest expense decreased million to million primarily due to lower average debt outstanding 
the lower average outstanding debt was the result of the paydown of our prior facility defined below with the proceeds from the sale of the divested federal business in the second quarter of fiscal year and the conversion of our convertible subordinated notes in the third quarter of fiscal year  offset by subsequent increases in our prior facility resulting from borrowings incurred to fund our share repurchase programs

in addition  the effective tax rate on the gain related to the sale of the divested federal business was 
our effective tax rate exceeds the statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes  offset by the items above 
liquidity and capital resources we finance our ongoing business operations through cash flows provided by operating activities and utilize excess cash flows combined with the issuance of debt and equity to finance our acquisition strategy 
cash flows during fiscal year  we generated approximately million in cash flows provided by operating activities compared to the fiscal year amount of approximately million 
fiscal year cash flows provided by operating activities includes a temporary benefit of million arising from mellon financial corporation mellon funding certain operating expenses of the acquired hr business that were not reimbursed to mellon until july per the terms of a transition services agreement 
mellon is providing certain accounting  treasury and payroll services for an interim period 
as part of these services  mellon is also paying certain operational costs on our behalf  such as employee related expenses and accounts payable 
this agreement and the related timing of payments to mellon had a favorable impact on our cash flows provided by operating activities for fiscal year and will continue to impact our cash flows provided by operating activities until the third quarter of fiscal year upon full integration of the acquired hr business employees and related accounting systems 
fiscal year cash flows provided by operating activities were negatively impacted by the payment of approximately million related to the settlement of the interest rate hedges associated with the issuance of the senior notes see derivatives below 
excluding these items in fiscal year  cash flows provided by operating activities was million 
fiscal year cash flows provided by operating activities was negatively impacted by a tax payment of approximately million related to the gain from the sale of the divested federal business gross proceeds from the sale of the divested federal business are reflected in cash flows provided by investing activities  but the tax payment related to the sale is presented as a reduction in cash flows provided by operating activities 
excluding this tax payment in fiscal year  cash flows provided by operating activities was million 
excluding the items discussed above  the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal year was primarily a result of increased net income and increased collections on our accounts receivable balances 
in fiscal year  cash flows provided by operating activities were adversely impacted by increased receivables related to development work on our georgia contract  which was substantially completed in the third quarter of fiscal year we collected billed amounts outstanding related to this development work in fiscal year the fiscal year improvement in net income excluding the fiscal year gain on sale of business and accounts receivables was partially offset by increased payments on our accrued liability balances  including the payment of a prior year legal settlement of million see significant developments fiscal year and the payment of the settlement on the georgia contract of million see significant developments fiscal year  as well as the timing of payments related to software used in our information technology outsourcing business  transfer agent fees related to our unclaimed property business and other contract related costs 
accounts receivable fluctuations may have a significant impact on our cash flows provided by operating activities 
the payments received from clients on our billed accounts receivables and the increase in such accounts receivable are reflected as a single component of our cash flows provided by operating activities  and the timing of collections of these receivables may have either a positive or negative impact on our liquidity 
during fiscal year  free cash flow as defined below was approximately million versus approximately million for fiscal year fiscal year free cash flow includes the million benefit from may and june operating expense for the acquired hr business due to mellon financing certain operating expenses on a temporary basis as discussed above offset by the million payment related to the settlement of the interest rate hedges as discussed above

we believe this free cash flow metric provides an additional measure of available cash flow after we have satisfied the capital expenditure requirements of our operations  and should not be taken in isolation to be a measure of cash flow available for us to satisfy all of our obligations and execute our business strategies 
we also rely on cash flows from investing and financing activities which  together with free cash flow  are expected to be sufficient for us to execute our business strategies 
our measure of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies

the credit facility provides for an unsecured billion multi currency revolving credit and competitive advance facility fully available in us dollars  euros or competitive loans in any currency 
multi currency commitments available in certain specified currencies other than us dollars or euros in an initial aggregate amount of million and swing line loans in an amount up to million are provided under the facility

in addition  million in letters of credit were issued at closing under the credit facility to replace letters of credit outstanding under the prior facility 
other than competitive loans and swing line loans  advances under the credit facility bear interest at a base rate generally equal to the prime rate of jp morgan or a eurocurrency rate plus a percentage ranging from to  currently determined based on our credit rating

as of june   million of outstanding surety bonds and million of our outstanding letters of credit secure our performance of contractual obligations with our clients 
in general  we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in the performance of our obligations under each contract  the probability of which we believe is remote 
in addition  we had approximately million of letters of credit which secure our casualty insurance and certain vendor programs 
we believe that we have sufficient capacity in the surety markets and liquidity from our cash flow and credit facility to respond to future requests for proposals 
we believe that available cash and cash equivalents  together with cash generated from operations and available borrowings under our credit facility  will provide adequate funds for our anticipated internal growth and operating needs  including capital expenditures  and to meet the cash requirements of our contractual obligations below 
in addition  we intend to continue our growth through acquisitions  which could require significant commitments of capital 
in order to pursue such opportunities we may be required to incur debt or to issue additional potentially dilutive securities in the future 
no assurance can be given as to our future acquisitions and expansion opportunities and how such opportunities will be financed 
derivatives in order to hedge the variability of future interest payments related to our senior notes resulting from changing interest rates  we entered into forward interest rate agreements in april the agreements were designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted interest payments in anticipation of the issuance of our senior notes 
the notional amount of the agreements totaled million and the agreements were terminated in june upon issuance of the senior notes 
the settlement of the forward interest rate agreements of million million  net of income tax expense is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be amortized as an increase in reported interest expense over the term of the senior notes  with approximately million amortized over the next months 
during fiscal year  we amortized approximately million to interest expense 
the amount of gain or loss related to hedge ineffectiveness was not material 
share repurchase programs our board of directors has authorized two share repurchase programs totaling billion of our class a common stock 
on september   we announced that our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to million of our class a common stock and on april   we announced that our board of directors authorized a new  incremental share repurchase program of up to million of our class a common stock 
the programs  which are open ended  will allow us to repurchase our shares on the open market from time to time in accordance with sec rules and regulations  including shares that could be purchased pursuant to sec rule b the number of shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases will be based on the level of cash and debt balances  general business conditions and other factors  including alternative investment opportunities 
we intend to fund the repurchase programs from various sources  including  but not limited to  cash on hand  cash flow from operations  and borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility 
as of june   we had repurchased approximately million shares at a total cost of approximately million and reissued million shares for proceeds totaling million to fund contributions to our employee stock purchase plan and k plan 
we have not repurchased any shares subsequent to june  convertible notes on february   we completed the redemption of our convertible subordinated notes due february  the convertible notes 
holders of of all the outstanding convertible notes converted their convertible notes to shares of our class a common stock per  principal amount of convertible notes in accordance with the procedures

options granted under both our stock incentive plan and our stock option plan generally vest in varying increments over a five year period 
it is expected that future option grants will contain matching vesting and exercise schedules 
this amendment does not amend or affect the vesting schedule  exercise price  quantity of options granted  shares into which such options are exercisable or life of any award under any outstanding option grant 
therefore  no compensation expense was recorded

we have indemnified lockheed martin corporation against certain specified claims from certain pre sale litigation  investigations  government audits and other issues related to the divested federal business 
our contractual maximum exposure under these indemnifications is million  however  we believe the actual exposure to be significantly less 
as of june   other accrued liabilities include a reserve for these claims in an amount we believe to be adequate at this time 
as discussed in item legal proceedings  we have agreed to indemnify mantech international corporation with respect to the doj investigation related to purchasing activities at hanscom during the period our education services business  which is included in our commercial segment  performs third party student loan servicing in the federal family education loan program ffel on behalf of various financial institutions 
we service these loans for 
table of contents investors under outsourcing arrangements and do not acquire any servicing rights that are transferable by us to a third party 
at june   we serviced a ffel portfolio of approximately million loans with an outstanding principal balance of approximately billion 
some servicing agreements contain provisions that  under certain circumstances  require us to purchase the loans from the investor if the loan guaranty has been permanently terminated as a result of a loan default caused by our servicing error 
if defaults caused by us are cured during an initial period  any obligation we may have to purchase these loans expires 
loans that we purchase may be subsequently cured  the guaranty reinstated and then we repackage the loans for sale to third parties 
we evaluate our exposure under our purchase obligations on defaulted loans and establish a reserve for potential losses  or default liability reserve  through a charge to the provision for loss on defaulted loans purchased 
the reserve is evaluated periodically and adjusted based upon management s analysis of the historical performance of the defaulted loans 
as of june  and  other accrued liabilities include reserves which we believe to be adequate 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions or conditions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements involve significant judgments and estimates 
revenue recognition a significant portion of our revenue is recognized based on objective criteria that does not require significant estimates or uncertainties 
for example  transaction volumes and time and costs under time and material and cost reimbursable arrangements are based on specific  objective criteria under the contracts 
accordingly  revenues recognized under these methods do not require the use of significant estimates that are susceptible to change 
revenue recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method does require the use of estimates and judgment as discussed below 
our policy follows the guidance from sec staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition sab 
sab provides guidance on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in financial statements and updates staff accounting bulletin topic to be consistent with emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the services have been provided to the client  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
during fiscal year  approximately of our revenue was recognized based on transaction volumes  approximately was fixed fee based  wherein our revenue is earned as we fulfill our performance obligations under the arrangement  approximately was related to cost reimbursable contracts  approximately of our revenue was recognized using percentage of completion accounting and the remainder is related to time and material contracts 
our revenue mix is subject to change due to the impact of acquisitions and new business 
revenues on cost reimbursable contracts are recognized by applying an estimated factor to costs as incurred  such factor being determined by the contract provisions and prior experience 
revenues on unit price contracts are recognized at the contractual selling prices of work completed and accepted by the client 
revenues on time and material contracts are recognized at the contractual rates as the labor hours and direct expenses are incurred 
revenues for business process outsourcing services are recognized as services are rendered  generally on the basis of the number of accounts or transactions processed 
information technology processing revenues are recognized as services are provided to the client  generally at the contractual selling prices of resources consumed or capacity utilized by our clients 
revenues from annual maintenance contracts are deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
revenues from hardware sales are recognized upon delivery to the client and when uncertainties regarding customer acceptance have expired 

table of contents revenues on certain fixed price contracts where we provide information technology system development and implementation services are recognized over the contract term based on the percentage of development and implementation services that are provided during the period compared with the total estimated development and implementation services to be provided over the entire contract using statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
sop requires the use of percentage of completion accounting for long term contracts that are binding agreements between us and our customers in which we agree  for compensation  to perform a service to the customer s specifications 
these services require that we perform significant  extensive and complex design  development  modification and implementation activities for our customers systems 
performance will often extend over long periods  and our right to receive future payment depends on our future performance in accordance with the agreement 
the percentage of completion methodology involves recognizing revenue using the percentage of services completed  on a current cumulative cost to total cost basis  using a reasonably consistent profit margin over the period 
due to the longer term nature of these projects  developing the estimates of costs often requires significant judgment 
factors that must be considered in estimating the progress of work completed and ultimate cost of the projects include  but are not limited to  the availability of labor and labor productivity  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  and the impact of delayed performance 
if changes occur in delivery  productivity or other factors used in developing the estimates of costs or revenues  we revise our cost and revenue estimates  which may result in increases or decreases in revenues and costs  and such revisions are reflected in income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision become known 
eitf addresses the accounting treatment for an arrangement to provide the delivery or performance of multiple products and or services where the delivery of a product or system or performance of services may occur at different points in time or over different periods of time 
the emerging issues task force reached a consensus regarding  among other issues  the applicability of the provisions regarding separation of contract elements in eitf to contracts where one or more elements fall within the scope of other authoritative literature  such as sop eitf does not impact the use of sop for contract elements that fall within the scope of sop  such as the implementation or development of an information technology system to client specifications under a long term contract 
where an implementation or development project is contracted with a client  and we will also provide services or operate the system over a period of time  eitf provides the methodology for separating the contract elements and allocating total arrangement consideration to the contract elements 
we adopted the provisions of eitf on a prospective basis to transactions entered into after july  we believe that eitf did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
revenues earned in excess of related billings are accrued  whereas billings in excess of revenues earned are deferred until the related services are provided 
we recognize revenues for non refundable  upfront implementation fees over the period between the initiation of the ongoing services through the end of the contract term on a straight line basis 
contingencies we account for claims and contingencies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas 
sfas requires that we record an estimated loss from a claim or loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for claims and contingencies requires us to use our judgment 
we consult with legal counsel on those issues related to litigation and seek input from other experts and advisors with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business 
our contracts with clients typically span several years 
we continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability 
if our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur  a loss accrual is recorded in the consolidated financial statements in the period it is first identified 
circumstances that could potentially result in contract losses over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions  variances from expected costs to deliver our services  and other factors affecting revenues and costs 
valuation of goodwill and intangibles due to the fact that we are primarily a services company  our business acquisitions typically result in significant amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible expense we could incur as a result of an impairment 
in addition  in connection with our revenue arrangements  we incur costs to originate contracts and to perform the transition and setup activities necessary to enable us to perform under the terms of the arrangement 
we capitalize certain incremental direct costs which are related to the contract origination or transition  implementation and setup activities and 
table of contents amortize them over the term of the arrangement 
from time to time  we also provide certain inducements to customers in the form of various arrangements  including contractual credits  which are capitalized and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the term of the contract 
the determination of the value of goodwill and other intangibles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future business trends and growth 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the balance of goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable 
in evaluating impairment  we estimate the sum of expected future cash flows derived from the goodwill or intangible asset 
such evaluation is significantly impacted by estimates and assumptions of future revenues  costs and expenses and other factors 
if an event occurs which would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our goodwill or other intangible assets  such revision could result in a non cash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial results 
pension and post employment benefits statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas  establishes standards for reporting and accounting for pension benefits provided to employees 
in connection with the acquisition of the acquired hr business  we assumed pension plans for the acquired hr business employees located in canada and the united kingdom uk 
the canadian acquired hr business has both a funded basic pension plan and an unfunded excess pension plan 
the uk pension scheme is a funded plan 
these defined benefit plans provide benefits for participating employees based on years of service and average compensation for a specified period before retirement 
we have established june as our measurement date for these defined benefit plans 
the net periodic benefit costs for these plans are included in wages and benefits in our consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the acquisition  may  the measurement of the pension benefit obligation of the plans at the acquisition date was accounted for using the business combination provisions in sfas  therefore  all previously existing unrecognized net gain or loss  unrecognized prior service cost  or unrecognized net obligation or net asset existing prior to the date of the acquisition was included in our calculation of the pension benefit obligation recorded at acquisition 
in addition to these pension plans  we also assumed a post employment medical plan for acquired hr business employees and retirees in canada 
the amount of health care benefits is limited to lifetime maximum and age limitations as described in the plan 
the following table summarizes the weighted average assumptions used in the determination of our benefit obligation for the year ended june  pension plans other benefit plan discount rate rate of increase in compensation levels n a the following table summarizes the assumptions used in the determination of our net periodic benefit cost for the period from may  through june  pension plans other benefit plan discount rate long term rate of return on assets n a rate of increase in compensation levels n a our discount rate is determined based upon high quality corporate bond yields as of the measurement date

effect on pension benefit obligation effect on service and interest cost we estimate the long term rate of return on uk and canadian plan assets will be and  respectively  based on the long term target asset allocation 
expected returns for the following asset classes used in the plans are based on a combination of long term historical returns and current and expected market conditions 

table of contents the uk pension scheme s target asset allocation is uk equities  overseas equities principally invested in developed markets  bonds issued by uk corporates  in uk treasury inflation linked bonds and in uk commercial property 
external investment managers actively manage all of the asset classes 
the target asset allocation has been set by the plan s trustee board with a view to meeting the long term return assumed for setting the employer s contributions while also reducing volatility relative to the plan s liabilities 
the managers engaged by the trustees manage their assets with a view to seeking moderate out performance of appropriate benchmarks for each asset class 
at this time  the trustees do not engage in any alternative investment strategies  apart from uk commercial property 
the canadian funded plan s target asset allocation is canadian provincial and corporate bonds  larger capitalization canadian stocks  developed and larger capitalization global ex canada stocks mainly us and international stocks and cash and cash equivalents 
a single investment manager actively manages all of the asset classes 
this manager uses an equal blend of large cap value and large cap growth for stocks in order to participate in the returns generated by stocks in the long term  while reducing year over year volatility 
the bonds are managed using a core approach where multiple strategies are engaged such as interest rate anticipation  credit selection and yield curve positioning to mitigate overall risk 
at this time  the manager does not engage in any alternative investment strategies 
we made contributions to the pension plans of approximately million in june in addition  approximately million related to a purchase price adjustment received from mellon financial corporation was funded into the pension plans prior to june  this amount is included in the plans cash and cash equivalents at june  and was subsequently invested pursuant to the plans target asset allocations 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas requires the disclosure of assumed healthcare cost trend rates for next year used to measure the expected cost of benefits covered 
for measurement purposes  an composite annual rate of increase in the per capita costs of covered healthcare benefits was assumed for fiscal year  this rate was assumed to decrease gradually to by and remain at that level thereafter 
the healthcare cost trend rate assumption may have a significant effect on the sfas projections 
the table below illustrates the effect of increasing or decreasing the assumed healthcare cost trend rates by one percentage point for each future year in thousands plus less effect on post employment benefit obligation effect on service and interest cost allowance for doubtful accounts we make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends  and changes in our customer payment terms and collection trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
any change in the assumptions used in analyzing a specific account receivable may result in additional allowance for doubtful accounts being recognized in the period in which the change occurs 
income taxes the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates  and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions may be challenged and that we may not succeed 
our provision for income taxes includes the impact of these reserve changes 
in the event that there is a significant unusual or one time item recognized in our operating results  the taxes attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or one time item 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances 
deferred income taxes are determined based on the difference between financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which such differences are expected to reverse 
we routinely evaluate all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization

revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires companies to measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and recognize compensation cost in its financial statements 
sfas r is effective beginning as of the first annual reporting period beginning after june  we will adopt sfas r beginning july  for new awards of stock based compensation granted after that date and for unvested awards outstanding at that date 
we believe the impact of sfas r on our results of operations will be consistent with our historical disclosures of pro forma stock compensation information under statement of financial accounting standards no

on october   the president signed into law the american jobs creation act of the act 
the act creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
fasb staff position accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of allows companies additional time beyond that provided in statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes to determine the impact of the act on its financial statements and provides guidance for the disclosure of the impact of the act on the financial statements 
at june   cumulative undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries for which non us taxes have not been recorded totaled million  the tax effects on which  if repatriated  cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
we are currently considering repatriation of amounts up to and including million  pending completion of our analysis 
this incentive is available to us until june  the dividends received deduction is subject to a number of limitations  and we have not yet decided whether  or to what extent  we might repatriate foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the us we will continue to monitor our international activities and expect to reach a decision regarding repatriation prior to the expiration of this incentive 
risks related to our business the risks described below should not be considered to be comprehensive and all inclusive 
additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any events occur that give rise to the following risks  our business  financial condition  cash flow or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected  and as a result  the trading price of our class a common stock could be materially and adversely impacted 
these risk factors should be read in conjunction with other information set forth in this report  including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 

table of contents loss of  or reduction of business from  significant clients our revenues  profitability and cash flow could be materially adversely affected by the loss of significant clients and or the reduction of volumes and services provided to our significant clients as a result of  among other things  their merger or acquisition  divestiture of assets or businesses  contract expiration or non renewal  or business failure or deterioration 
in addition  we incur fixed costs related to our information technology outsourcing and business process outsourcing clients 
therefore the loss of any one of our significant clients could leave us with a significantly higher level of fixed costs than is necessary to serve our remaining clients  thereby reducing our profitability and cash flow 
impairment of investments made to attract clients in order to attract and retain large outsourcing contracts we sometimes make significant capital investments to perform the agreement  such as purchases of information technology equipment and costs incurred to develop and implement software 
the net book value of such assets recorded  including a portion of our intangible assets  could be impaired  and our earnings and cash flow could be materially adversely affected in the event of the early termination of all or a part of such a contract or the reduction in volumes and services thereunder for reasons such as  among other things  the client s merger or acquisition  divestiture of assets or businesses  business failure or deterioration  or a client s exercise of contract termination rights 
competition we expect to encounter additional competition as we address new markets and new competitors enter our existing markets 
if we are forced to lower our pricing or if demand for our services decreases  our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flow may be materially and adversely affected 
some of our competitors have substantially greater resources  and they may be able to use their resources to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies  to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services  or to obtain client contracts where sizable asset purchases  investments or financing support are required 
in addition  we must frequently compete with a client s own internal business process and information technology capabilities  which may constitute a fixed cost for the client 
in the future  competition could continue to emerge from large computer hardware or software providers as they shift their business strategy to include services 
competition has also emerged from european and indian offshore service providers seeking to expand into our markets and from large consulting companies seeking operational outsourcing opportunities 
difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy we intend to continue to expand our business through the acquisition of complementary companies 
we cannot  however  make any assurances that we will be able to identify any potential acquisition candidates or consummate any additional acquisitions or that any future acquisitions will be successfully integrated or will be advantageous to us 
without additional acquisitions  we are unlikely to maintain historical total growth rates 
failure to properly manage our operations and our growth we have rapidly expanded our operations in recent years 
we intend to continue expansion in the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities 
this rapid growth places a significant demand on our management and operational resources 
in order to manage growth effectively  we must implement and improve our operational systems  procedures  and controls on a timely basis 
if we fail to implement these systems  procedures and controls on a timely basis  we may not be able to service our clients needs  hire and retain new employees  pursue new business  complete future acquisitions or operate our businesses effectively 
we could also trigger contractual credits to clients 
failure to properly transition new clients to our systems  properly budget transition costs or accurately estimate new contract operational costs could result in delays in our contract performance  trigger service level penalties or result in contracts whose profit margins did not meet our expectations or our historical profit margins 
failure to properly integrate acquired operations could result in increased cost 
as a result of any of these problems associated with expansion  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected 
government clients termination rights  audits and investigations approximately half of our revenues are derived from contracts with state and local governments and from a contract with the department of education 
governments and their agencies may terminate most of these contracts at any time  without cause 
also  our department of education contract is subject to the approval of appropriations being made by the united states congress to fund the expenditures to be made by the federal government under this contract 
additionally  government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations by government agencies 
if the government finds that we improperly charged any costs to a contract  the costs are not reimbursable or  if already reimbursed  the cost must be refunded to the government 
if the government discovers 
table of contents improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations  the contractor may be subject to various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  which may include termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with the government 
any resulting penalties or sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
further  the negative publicity that arises from findings in such audits  investigations or the penalties or sanctions therefore could have an adverse effect on our reputation in the industry and reduce our ability to compete for new contracts and may also have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
government clients protests of contract awards after an award of a government contract  a competing bidder may protest the award 
if we are awarded the contract and it is protested  it will be necessary to incur costs to defend the award of the contract  which costs may be significant and could include hiring experts to defend the basis for the contract award 
some contract protests may take years to resolve 
in some instances where we are awarded a contract  the contracting government entity may request that we sign a contract and commence services  even though the contract award has been protested 
if the protest is upheld  then our contract would be terminated and the amounts due to us for services that have been performed to date would be subject to payment pursuant to the terms of the terminated contract 
such terms may not provide for full recovery of our incurred costs 
in addition  if the government agency requests that we make changes to our contractual agreement during a protest period  but the government agency is unable or unwilling to modify the contract at the end of the protest period whether or not we are successful in defending the protest  then we may be unable to recover the full costs incurred in making such changes 
in addition  we may suffer negative publicity as the result of any contract protest being upheld and our contract being terminated 
further  if there is a re bid of the contract  we would incur additional costs associated with the re bid process and be subject to a potential protest if we are awarded a subsequent contract 
exercise of contract termination provisions and service level penalties most of our contracts with our clients permit termination in the event our performance is not consistent with service levels specified in those contracts  or provide for credits to our clients for failure to meet service levels 
in addition  if clients are not satisfied with our level of performance  our clients may seek damages as permitted under the contract and or our reputation in the industry may suffer  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flow 
pricing risks many of our contracts contain provisions requiring that our services be priced based on a pre established standard or benchmark regardless of the costs we incur in performing these services 
many of our contracts contain pricing provisions that require the client to pay a set fee for our services regardless of whether our costs to perform these services exceed the amount of the set fee 
some of our contracts contain re pricing provisions which can result in reductions of our fees for performing our services 
in such situations  we are exposed to the risk that we may be unable to price our services to levels that will permit recovery of our costs  and may adversely affect our operating results and cash flow 
actuarial consulting services and benefit plan management potential claims in may  we acquired the human resources consulting business of mellon financial corporation  which includes actuarial consulting services related to commercial  governmental and taft hartley pension plans 
providers of these types of consulting services have experienced frequent claims  some of which have resulted in litigation and significant settlements or judgments  particularly when investment markets have performed poorly and pension funding levels have been adversely impacted 
in addition  our total benefits outsourcing business unit manages and administers benefit plans on behalf of its clients and is responsible for processing numerous plan transactions for current and former employees of those clients 
we are subject to claims from the client and its current and former employees if transactions are not properly processed 
if any claim is made against us in the future related to our actuarial consulting services or benefit plan management services  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow could be materially adversely affected as a result of the time and cost required to defend such a claim  the cost of settling such a claim or paying any judgments resulting therefrom  or the damage to our reputation in the industry that could result from the negative publicity surrounding such a claim 
loss of significant software vendor relationships our ability to service our clients depends to a large extent on our use of various software programs that we license from a small number of primary software vendors 
if our significant software vendors were to terminate  refuse to renew our contracts with them or offer to renew our contracts with them on less advantageous terms than previously contracted  we might not be able to replace the related software programs and would be unable to serve our clients or we would recognize reduced margins from the contracts with our clients  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  revenues  profitability and cash flow 

table of contents intellectual property infringement claims we rely heavily on the use of intellectual property 
we do not own the majority of the software that we use to run our business  instead we license this software from a small number of primary vendors 
if these vendors assert claims that we or our clients are infringing on their software or related intellectual property  we could incur substantial costs to defend these claims  which could have a material effect on our profitability and cash flow 
in addition  if any of our vendors infringement claims are ultimately successful  our vendors could require us to cease selling or using products or services that incorporate the challenged software or technology  to obtain a license or additional licenses from our vendors  or to redesign our products and services which rely on the challenged software or technology 
if we are unsuccessful in the defense of an infringement claim and our vendors require us to initiate any of the above actions  then such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
rapid technological changes the markets for our business process and information technology services are subject to rapid technological changes and rapid changes in client requirements 
we may be unable to timely and successfully customize products and services that incorporate new technology or to deliver the services and products demanded by the marketplace 
united states and foreign jurisdiction laws relating to individually identifiable information we process  transmit and store information relating to identifiable individuals  both in our role as a service provider and as an employer 
as a result  we are subject to numerous united states both federal and state and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect individually identifiable information  including social security numbers  financial and health information 
for example  in  congress passed the health insurance portability and accountability act and as required therein  the department of health and human services established regulations governing  among other things  the privacy  security and electronic transmission of individually identifiable health information 
we have taken measures to comply with each of those regulations on or before the required dates 
another example is the european union directive on data protection  entitled directive ec of the european parliament and of the council of october on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data 
we have also taken steps to address the requirements of that directive 
other united states both federal and state and foreign jurisdiction laws apply to the processing of individually identifiable information as well  and additional legislation may be enacted at any time 
failure to comply with these types of laws may subject us to  among other things  liability for monetary damages  fines and or criminal prosecution  unfavorable publicity  restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations  any of which may have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow 
security security systems have been implemented with the intent of maintaining the physical security of our facilities and to protect confidential information and information related to identifiable individuals from unauthorized access through our information systems  but we are subject to breach of security systems at the facilities at which we maintain such confidential customer information and information relating to identifiable individuals 
if unauthorized users gain physical access to the facility or electronic access to our information systems  such information may be subject to theft and misuse 
any theft or misuse of such information could result in  among other things  unfavorable publicity  difficulty in marketing our services  allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations and possible financial obligations for damages related to the theft or misuse of such information  any of which may have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow 
we anticipate that breaches of security will occur from time to time  but the magnitude and impact on our business of any future breach cannot be ascertained 
budget deficits at  or fluctuations in the number of requests for proposals issued by  state and local governments and their agencies approximately half of our revenues are derived from contracts with state and local governments and their agencies 
currently  many state and local governments that we have contracts with are facing potential budget deficits 
also  the number of requests for proposals issued by state and local government agencies is subject to fluctuation 
it is unclear what impact  if any  these deficits may have on our future business  revenues  results of operations and cash flow 
international risks recently we have expanded our international operations and also continually contemplate the acquisition of companies formed and operating in foreign countries 
we have approximately  employees in mexico  guatemala  india  ghana  jamaica  dominican republic  spain  malaysia  ireland  germany  china  united kingdom and canada  as well as a number of other countries  that 
table of contents primarily support our commercial business process and information technology outsourcing services 
our international operations and acquisitions are subject to a number of risks 
these risks include the possible impact on our operations of the laws of foreign countries where we may do business including  among others  data privacy  laws regarding licensing and labor council requirements 
in addition  we may experience difficulty integrating the management and operations of businesses we acquire internationally  and we may have difficulty attracting  retaining and motivating highly skilled and qualified personnel to staff key managerial positions in our ongoing international operations 
further  our international operations and acquisitions are subject to a number of risks related to general economic and political conditions in foreign countries where we operate  including  among others  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  cultural differences  political instability and additional expenses and risks inherent in conducting operations in geographically distant locations 
our international operations and acquisitions may also be impacted by trade restrictions  such as tariffs and duties or other trade controls imposed by the united states or other jurisdictions  as well as other factors that may adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
because of these foreign operations we are subject to regulations  such as those administered by the department of treasury s office of foreign assets controls ofac and export control regulations administered by the department of commerce 
violation of these regulations could result in fines  criminal sanctions against our officers  and prohibitions against exporting  as well as damage to our reputation  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
armed hostilities and terrorist attacks terrorist attacks and further acts of violence or war may cause major instability in the us and other financial markets in which we operate 
in addition  armed hostilities and acts of terrorism may directly impact our physical facilities and operations  which are located in north america  central america  south america  europe  africa  australia  asia and the middle east  or those of our clients 
these developments subject our worldwide operations to increased risks and  depending on their magnitude  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
failure to attract and retain necessary technical personnel  skilled management and qualified subcontractors our success depends to a significant extent upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled and qualified personnel and to subcontract with qualified  competent subcontractors 
if we fail to attract  train  and retain  sufficient numbers of these technically skilled people or are unable to contract with qualified  competent subcontractors  our business  financial condition  and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
experienced and capable personnel in the technology industry remain in high demand  and there is continual competition for their talents 
our success also depends on the skills  experience  and performance of key members of our management team and on qualified  competent subcontractors 
the loss of any key employee or the loss of a key subcontract relationship could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flow  results of operations and prospects 
servicing risks we service for various lenders and under various service agreements a portfolio of approximately billion of loans  as of june   made under the federal family education loan program  which loans are guaranteed by a federal government agency 
if a loan is in default  then a claim is made upon the guarantor 
if the guarantor denies the claim because of a servicing error  then under certain of the servicing agreements we may be required to purchase the loan from the lender 
upon purchase of the loan  we attempt to cure the servicing errors and either sell the loan back to the guarantor which must occur within a specified period of time or sell the loan on the open market to a third party 
we are subject to the risk that we may be unable to cure the servicing errors or sell the loan on the open market 
our reserves  which are based on historical information  may be inadequate if our servicing performance results in the requirement that we repurchase a substantial number of loans  which repurchase could have a material adverse impact on our cash flow and profitability 
disruption in utility or network services our services are dependent on the companies providing electricity and other utilities to our operating facilities  as well as network companies providing connectivity to our facilities and clients 
while there are backup systems in many of our operating facilities  an extended outage of utility or network services may have a material adverse effect on our operations  revenues  cash flow and profitability 
indemnification risk our contracts  including our agreements with respect to divestitures  include various indemnification obligations 
if we are required to satisfy an indemnification obligation  that may have a material adverse effect on our business  profitability and cash flow 

table of contents other risks we have attempted to identify material risk factors currently affecting our business and company 
however  additional risks that we do not yet know of  or that we currently think are immaterial  may occur or become material 
these risks could impair our business operations or adversely affect revenues  cash flow or profitability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  changes in market value of financial instruments caused by changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
sensitivity analysis is one technique used to measure the impact of changes in the interest rates and foreign exchange rates on our results of operations or financial position 
the following analysis provides a framework to understand our sensitivity to hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as of june  we entered into fixed rate senior notes during fiscal year the senior notes are subject to market risk from changes in interest rates 
risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of in market interest rates 
if these rates were higher or lower at june   the fair value of the senior notes would be approximately million or million  respectively 
changes in the fair value of our fixed rate senior notes would not impact our results of operations or cash flows  unless redeemed prior to maturity 
we have variable rate debt instruments 
our variable rate debt instruments are subject to market risk from changes in interest rates 
risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of in short term market interest rates 
if these rates averaged higher or lower during fiscal years and  there would have been no material adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flows 
we conduct business in the united states and in foreign countries and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our non united states denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions 
risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of in foreign currency rates against the us dollar 
if these rates averaged higher or lower during fiscal year and  there would have been no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position
