overview we are a worldwide producer of ion implantation  dry strip  thermal processing and curing equipment used in the fabrication of semiconductors 
in addition  we provide extensive aftermarket service and support  including spare parts  equipment upgrades  and maintenance services 
we own of the equity of a joint venture  known as sen  with sumitomo heavy industries  ltd 
in japan 
sen licenses technology from the company relating to the manufacture of ion implantation products and has exclusive rights to manufacture and sell these products to the territory of japan 
sen is the leading producer of ion implantation equipment in japan 
the semiconductor capital equipment industry is subject to significant cyclical swings in capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers 
capital spending is influenced by demand for semiconductors and the products using them  the utilization rate and capacity of existing semiconductor manufacturing facilities and changes in semiconductor technology  all of which are outside of the company s control 
as a result  the company s revenues and gross margins  to the extent affected by increases or decreases in volume  can fluctuate significantly from year to year and period to period 
our gross margins also may be affected by the introduction of new products 
we typically become more efficient in producing our products as they mature 
for example  our gross margins in  and were adversely affected in part as a result of the increased proportion of systems sold to process mm wafers 
at december   gross margins on mm products were in line with what we have realized historically on our mm products 
the company s expense base is largely fixed and does not vary significantly with changes in volume 
therefore  the company expects to experience significant fluctuations in operating results and cash flows depending on the level of capital expenditures by semiconductor equipment manufacturers 
the substantial expense of building  upgrading or expanding a semiconductor fabrication facility is increasingly causing semiconductor companies to contract with foundries to manufacture their semiconductors 
in addition  consolidation and joint venturing within the semiconductor manufacturing industry is increasing 
we expect these trends to continue  which will reduce the number of our potential customers 
this increased concentration of our customers potentially makes our revenues more volatile as higher percentages of our total revenues are tied to a particular customer s or a small number of customers buying decisions 
axcelis accesses the important japanese market for ion implant through a joint venture that the company does not control 
the joint venture agreement gives both owners veto rights  so that neither of the owners alone can effectively control sen 
sen s business is subject to the same risks as the company s business 
royalties and equity income from sen have made a substantial contribution to the company s earnings  and a substantial decline in sen s sales and net income could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
as a result of this joint venture structure  the company has less control over sen management than over the company s own management and may not have timely knowledge of factors affecting sen s business 
in addition  given the equal balance of ownership  it is possible that the sen board may be unable to reach consensus on important matters from time to time which could delay important decisions 
operating results for the years presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for future years 
critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon axcelis consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  income taxes  accounts receivable  inventory and warranty obligations 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following accounting policies are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition policy involves significant judgment by management 
as described in detail below  the company considers a broad array of facts and circumstances in determining when to recognize revenue  including contractual obligations to the customer  the complexity of the customer s post delivery acceptance provisions  payment history  customer creditworthiness and the installation process 
in the future  if the post delivery acceptance provisions and installation process become more complex or result in a materially lower rate of acceptance  the company may have to revise its revenue recognition policy  which could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
for revenue arrangements prior to july   axcelis generally recognized the full sale price at the time of shipment to the customer 
the costs of system installation at the customer s site were accrued at the time of shipment for installation and acceptance testing performance obligations incurred at the time of sale 
in addition  the standard and non standard warranties were accrued at the time of shipment 
the company recognized the full sales price at the time of shipment as management believed that the customer s post delivery acceptance provisions and installation process were established to be routine  commercially inconsequential and perfunctory because the process was a replication of the pre shipment procedures 
also  customer payment terms typically provided that the majority of the purchase price was payable upon shipment 
terms generally contained delayed payment arrangements for a portion of the purchase price which were typically time based 
in november  the financial accounting standards board s emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
this issue addresses determination of whether an arrangement involving more than one deliverable contains more than one unit of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting 
eitf became effective for revenue arrangements entered into in periods beginning after june  for revenue arrangements occurring on or after july   the company has revised its revenue recognition policy to comply with the provisions of eitf in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition 
sab supersedes staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab s primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements  superseded as a result of the issuance of eitf additionally  sab rescinds the sec s revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers the faq issued with sab that had been codified in sec topic  revenue recognition 
selected portions of the faq have been incorporated into sab while the wording of sab has changed to reflect the issuance of eitf  the revenue recognition principles of sab remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab as a result  the adoption of this pronouncement did not have any impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
axcelis revenue transactions include sales of systems under multiple element arrangements 
revenue under these arrangements is allocated to each element  except systems  based upon its estimated fair market value 
the amount of revenue allocated to systems is calculated on a residual method 
under this method  the total value of the arrangement is allocated first to the undelivered elements  with the residual amount being allocated to systems revenue 
the value of the undelivered elements includes a the greater of i the fair value of the installation or ii the portion of the sales price that will not be received until the installation is completed the retention plus b the fair value of all other undelivered elements 
the amount allocated to installation is based upon the fair value of the service performed  including labor  which is based upon the estimated time to complete the installation and hourly rates  and material components 
the fair value of all other undelivered elements is based upon the price charged when these elements are sold separately 
system revenue is generally recognized upon shipment provided title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are contractually fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured through historical collection results and regular credit evaluations  and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 
revenue from installation services is recognized at the time formal acceptance is received from the customer or  for installation of certain systems to certain customers  when both the formal acceptance and retention payment have been received 
revenue for other elements is recognized at the time products are shipped or the related services are performed 
management continues to believe recognition of systems revenue at the time of shipment is appropriate because the customer s post delivery acceptance provisions and installation process have been established to be routine  commercially inconsequential and perfunctory 
the majority of axcelis systems are designed and tailored to meet the customer s specifications  as outlined in the contract between the customer and axcelis  which may be the axcelis standard specification 
to ensure that the customer s specifications are satisfied  many customers request that newer systems be tested at axcelis facilities prior to shipment  normally with the customer present  under conditions that substantially replicate the customer s production environment and the customer s criteria are confirmed to have been met 
customers for mature products generally do not require pre shipment testing 
the company believes the risk of failure to complete a system installation is remote 
should an installation not be completed successfully  the contractual provisions do not provide for forfeiture  refund or other purchase price concession beyond those prescribed by the provisions of the uniform commercial code applicable generally to such transactions 
in the small number of instances where axcelis is unsure of meeting the customer s specifications or obtaining customer acceptance upon shipment of the system or for initial shipments of systems with new technologies  axcelis will defer the recognition of systems revenue until written customer acceptance of the system is obtained 
this deferral period is generally within twelve months of shipment 
services revenue includes revenue from spare parts  equipment upgrades and maintenance services 
revenue related to maintenance and service contracts is recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts  or based on parts usage  where appropriate 
revenue related to time and material services is recognized when the services are performed 
revenue related to spare parts sales and equipment upgrades is recognized upon the later of shipment or when the title and risk of loss passes to the customer 
deferred tax assets at december   the company has million of deferred tax assets relating to net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and other temporary differences which are available to reduce income taxes in future years 
sfas no 
accounting for income taxes requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
a review of all available positive and negative evidence needs to be considered  including a company s performance  the market environment in which the company operates  length of carryback and carryforward periods  existing sales backlog  and projections of future operating results 
where there are cumulative losses in recent years  sfas no 
creates a strong presumption that a valuation allowance is needed 
this presumption can be overcome in very limited circumstances 
during the second quarter of  the company entered a three year cumulative loss position and revised its projections of the amount and timing of profitability in future periods 
as a result  the company increased its valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets to zero 
the company expects to record a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until it can sustain an appropriate level of profitability 
however  going forward should the company s return to profitability provide sufficient evidence  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 to support the ultimate realization of income tax benefits attributable to net operating losses  tax credit carryforwards  and other deductible temporary differences  a reduction in the valuation allowance may be recorded and the carrying value of deferred tax assets may be restored  resulting in a non cash credit to earnings 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting pursuant to statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 business combinations 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over net assets  including all identifiable intangible assets  of acquired businesses that are consolidated 
pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized 
other intangible assets that are separable from goodwill and have determinable useful lives are valued separately and amortized over their useful lives 
such other identifiable intangible assets consist mainly of developed technology and customer related intangibles and are generally amortized over periods ranging from five to ten years 
we have determined that all of our other intangible assets have finite lives 
the company performs an annual impairment review of goodwill 
impairment reviews may be performed more frequently if there are other indicators of impairment 
the annual impairment test consists of determining the fair market value of the business unit through a discounted cash flow analysis 
management s best judgments are employed in determining future market conditions that impact this discounted cash flow analysis 
as a result of our annual review conducted as of december   we determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill 
if we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill has been impaired  we would record the impairment charge in our statement of operations as a non cash charge to earnings 
we assess the impairment of intangible assets  other than goodwill  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following a significant underperformance relative to expected operating results  a significant change in the manner of our use of the acquired asset or the strategy for our overall business  a significant negative industry or economic trend  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
as part of this assessment  we review the expected future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts axcelis records an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of axcelis customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be necessary 
inventory allowance for excess and obsolescence axcelis records an allowance for estimated excess and obsolete inventory 
the allowance is determined using management s assumptions of materials usage  based on estimates of demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions become less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
product warranty and installation costs the company offers a one to three year warranty for all of its products  the terms and conditions of which vary depending upon the product sold 
prior to july   the company estimated the costs that may be incurred under its standard warranty  non standard warranty  and product installation obligations and recorded a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue was recognized 
subsequent to july   in connection with the change in its revenue recognition policy see revenue recognition  the company no longer accrues the estimated costs of product installation or non standard warranty but defers the portion of systems revenue attributable to the fair value of future services to be delivered 
factors that affect the company s warranty and installation liability include the number of installed units  historical and anticipated product failure rates  material usage and service labor costs 
the company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded liability and adjusts the amount as necessary 
results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated years ended december  revenue systems services royalties  primarily from sumitomo eaton nova corporation cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research development selling general administrative amortization intangible assets restructuring income loss from operations other income expense equity income of sumitomo eaton nova corporation interest income interest expense other net income loss before income taxes income taxes credit net income loss year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  revenue revenue from system sales was million or of revenue in  compared with million  or of revenue  in the increase in sales of systems compared with was primarily attributable to strong market demand resulting from high levels of chip production by our semiconductor manufacturing customers 
on a product basis  approximately of revenue from system sales for was from the sale of mm products and was from the sale of mm products  compared with and  respectively  for sales of mm products were strong during due to the expansion of existing mm production capacity that outpaced the investment in new mm fabrication facilities 
services revenue  which includes spare parts  equipment upgrades  and maintenance services  was million  or of revenue for  compared with million  or of revenue for the increase in the amount of service revenue in compared with was a result of increased capacity utilization by our customers which has a direct effect on demand for both spare parts and billable labor 
in addition  as the out of warranty installed base increased  demand for service maintenance contracts also increased 
as described above in revenue recognition  a portion of the company s revenue from system sales is deferred until installation and other services related to future deliverables are performed 
the total amount of deferred revenue at december  and was million and million  respectively 
of the company s royalty revenue million is earned under the terms of the company s license agreement with sen 
approximately million of the million increase in royalties in as compared to is due to higher sen sales volume reflecting growth in demand for equipment by japanese semiconductor manufacturers 
revenue from sales of ion implantation products and services for accounted for million  or  of total revenue in  compared with million  or  of total revenue in the higher proportion of total revenue from the sale of ion implantation products and services in is primarily a result of capacity expansion by semiconductor manufacturers whereby capital spending for ion implantation products has outpaced increases in total wafer fabrication equipment spending 
worldwide revenues including revenues of sen for the years ending december  and were million and million  respectively 
worldwide revenues for increased by million compared to due to the growth in demand for equipment by semiconductor manufacturers discussed above 
axcelis believes that the information regarding the aggregate annual revenues of sen  a owned unconsolidated subsidiary of axcelis  combined with axcelis own revenues for the year  is useful to investors 
sen s ion implant products are covered by a license from axcelis and therefore the combined revenue of the two companies indicates the full market penetration of axcelis technology 
gross profit gross profit was of revenue in compared with gross profit of of revenue in the gross profit increase of percentage points was primarily due to increased sales volume and the related increased absorption of fixed manufacturing costs approximately percentage points  reduced system warranty costs approximately percentage points and improved pricing approximately percentage point due to favorable market conditions which provided increased demand and an expanded customer base 
research and development research and development expense was million in  a decrease of million  compared to million in while research and development expenses remained primarily flat year over year  the individual components varied 
increased variable compensation million and expenses associated with the timing of projects million were offset in part by lower amortization related to demo tools used in r d million  lower payroll and payroll related expense primarily due to headcount reductions million  lower facility costs allocated to research and development million  and lower fixed costs associated with depreciation and leased equipment million 
selling selling expense was million for  an increase of million  or  compared with million for primarily due to increased expenses for customer and evaluation tool support million  travel associated with increased volume million  and commissions million 
cost increases were offset in part by lower payroll and payroll related expense primarily due to the company s september restructuring million 
general and administrative general and administrative expense was million in  an increase of million  or  as compared with million in general and administrative expense increased in primarily due to increased variable compensation million  higher audit fees and costs related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act million 
in addition  general and administrative expense in was reduced by an adjustment of million to reflect a change in estimate relating to unfunded pension and other benefits recorded in prior years 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets was million in  an increase of million  or  as compared with million in the increase was due to a full year of amortization expense relating to the intangible assets acquired as part of the matrix integrated systems  inc acquisition completed on july  restructuring restructuring expense of million in consists primarily of severance and other one time termination benefits related to reduction in force actions and the consolidation of the company s rockville  maryland operations into its headquarters and manufacturing facility located in beverly  massachusetts 
the company expects to incur approximately million related to both of these actions  of which to million is expected to be incurred over the first three quarters of approximately million of this amount is expected to result in future cash expenditures 
other income expense equity income attributable to sen was million in compared to million in fluctuations in equity contributions from sen reflect changes in its sales volume and net income resulting from demand changes in the japanese semiconductor market 
interest income of million primarily relates to interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest income increased by million from due primarily to increased levels of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in  as well as higher interest rates 
interest expense of million in primarily relates to the company s long term debt issued in january interest expense increased by million compared with due primarily to the amortization of bank fees associated with the october renegotiation of the company s revolving credit facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
income taxes income tax expense for has been reduced by million from the reversal of income tax accruals recorded in prior years for certain tax matters that were resolved in the second quarter of income tax expense relates principally to operating results of foreign entities in jurisdictions where the company is taxable 
income tax expense attributable to us operations is minimal because taxable income derived from the current year operating results is substantially offset by available net operating loss carryforwards 
income taxes in consisted primarily of a valuation allowance of million recorded at june  to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets to zero 
year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  revenue revenue from system sales was million or of revenue in  compared with million  or of revenue  in the increase in sales of systems was primarily attributable to increased levels of production volume by our semiconductor manufacturing customers 
increased sales were offset in part by reduced average selling prices caused by a competitive market environment and a concentration of systems sales to a limited number of customers

deferred revenue at december  amounted to million 
royalties were million  or of revenue  for  compared with million  or of revenue  in royalties decreased by million in compared with the decrease is primarily due to the changes in the japanese semiconductor market and the adoption of eitf which had the effect of reducing royalties attributable to deferred revenue in by million 
sen previously recorded revenue based on system shipments  however  with the adoption of eitf sen now records revenue based on final acceptance from the customer 
royalty income is based on a percentage of sen s net sales recognized 
revenue from sales of ion implantation products and services for accounted for million  or  of total revenue in the  compared with million  or  of total revenue worldwide revenues including revenues of sen for the years ending december  and were million and million  respectively

sen s ion implant products are covered by a license from axcelis and therefore the combined revenue of the two companies indicates the full market penetration of axcelis technology 
gross profit gross profit was of net sales in compared to gross profit of in the decrease in gross profit was due to higher warranty costs associated with mm product shipments approximately percentage points  the company s implementation of a revised revenue recognition policy to comply with the provisions of eitf approximately percentage points  and a reduction in average selling prices discussed above approximately percentage points 
these items were offset by improved manufacturing costs due to increased factory utilization and lower raw material costs 
research and development research and development expense was million in  a decrease of million  or  compared to million in the decrease in research and development expense in is due principally to lower investment in our multi wafer mm product development efforts and a corresponding reduction in headcount by approximately from december  to december  final completion and release of mm products was accomplished in the second half of selling selling expense was million in  an increase of million  or  as compared to million in the increase in selling expense was primarily due to increased sales and sales support investments for our expanding asia pacific markets 
general and administrative general and administrative expense was million in  a decrease of million  or  as compared with million in the decrease in general and administrative expense was attributable to lower costs associated with headcount reductions and an adjustment of million to reflect a change in estimate relating to unfunded pension expense and other benefits recorded in prior periods 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets was million in  an increase of million  or  compared with million in the increase was due to amortization expense relating to the intangible assets acquired as part of the matrix integrated systems  inc acquisition completed on july  restructuring restructuring costs of million in relate to severance and other benefits associated with reduction in force actions the company took during the third quarter of to reduce headcount by approximately permanent positions 
as of december   million had been paid 
the company estimates the annual savings from the restructuring to approximate million 
other income expense equity income attributable to sen was million in compared to million in the change in sen s revenue recognition policy to comply with the provisions of eitf had the effect of reducing the equity income from sen by approximately million for other fluctuations in equity contributions from sen reflect changes in sen s sales volume and net income resulting from demand changes in the japanese semiconductor market 
interest income of million primarily relates to interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest income decreased by million from due primarily to a lower amount of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in  as well as lower interest rates 
interest expense of million in primarily relates to the company s long term debt issued in january interest expense increased by million from primarily due to interest expense and amortization of bank fees related to the company s revolving credit facility as well as a full year of interest expense associated with the company s convertible debt issuance 
see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
income taxes credit income taxes provided were million in as compared to an income tax credit of million in income taxes for consist primarily of a valuation allowance of million recorded at june  to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets to zero 
see further discussion under critical accounting policies 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments at december  were million  compared to million at december  the million increase in cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments is mainly attributable to million in cash generated by operations  million in net proceeds from the sale of a building located in beverly  massachusetts in january and million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and stock purchases under the employee stock purchase plan which were partially offset by million in capital expenditures 
net working capital was million at december  as compared to net working capital of million at december  the million increase in net working capital is attributable principally to the company s higher levels of profitable operations 
capital expenditures were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company has no significant capital projects planned for and total capital expenditures for are projected to be less than million 
future capital expenditures beyond will depend on a number of factors  including the timing and rate of expansion of our business 
expenditures for demo tools  used in house for research and development and training  and evaluation tools  which are located at customers sites and are being evaluated for potential purchase  were approximately million and million for and  respectively 
demo and evaluation tools are included in amounts reported as other assets 
the company has no off balance sheet arrangements other than foreign exchange contracts used to hedge the company s royalty receivable from sen million at december  
in october the company renegotiated its million revolving credit facility to extend the maturity to october the purpose of the facility is to provide funds for working capital and general corporate purposes as required 
to the extent that the company has borrowings under the agreement  those borrowings would bear interest at the bank s base rate  as defined in the agreement  or libor plus an applicable percentage 
the company currently has no plans to borrow against the facility but may use the facility to support letters of credit in the future 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the company s assets excluding the company s investment in sen and contains certain financial and other restrictive covenants including restrictions on the payment of dividends  minimum levels of tangible net worth  liquidity and profitability as well as maximum levels of indebtedness and capital spending 
at december   the company was in compliance with all covenants 
the company incurs an annual commitment fee based on an ebitda formula outlined in the agreement applied to the full commitment 
the company has standby letters of credit in the amount of million to support certain operating lease obligations  workers compensation insurance  and certain value added tax claims in europe 
guarantees of which million are cash collateralized relate to value added tax refunds in europe 
the following represents the contractual obligations and commercial commitments of the company as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt including interest    purchase order commitments   operating leases    amount of commitment expiration by period other commercial commitments total thereafter unused line of credit   standby letters of credit   guarantees    axcelis liquidity is affected by many factors 
some of these factors are based on normal operations of the business and others relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the semiconductor equipment industry 
although our cash requirements fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
recent accounting pronouncements fin r in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
r consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
fin r 
fin r provides a new consolidation model that determines control and consolidation based on potential variability in gains and losses 
the provisions of fin r are effective for enterprises with variable interests in variable interest entities created after december  for public companies with variable interests in variable interest entities created before december   the provisions of fin r are to be applied no later than march  the company has determined that its equity investment in sen does not constitute a variable interest entity that would require consolidation 
accordingly  fin r did not have any impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
sfas in november the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas inventory costs  an amendment of arb  chapter 
sfas amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
sfas requires that idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  sfas requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june   however early adoption is permitted for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after november the company plans to adopt sfas on january  the company is assessing what effect  if any  adopting sfas will have on its financial position or results of operations 
sfas r on december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in statement however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is not an alternative 
sfas r must be adopted no later than july  the company plans to adopt sfas r effective july  sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective approach or a modified retrospective approach 
under the modified prospective approach  compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date based on a the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b the requirements of sfas r for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
the modified retrospective approach  includes the requirements of the modified prospective approach  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either all prior periods presented or prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the company is evaluating which method to adopt 
as permitted by sfas  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method  and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of the fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income loss and net income loss per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow under current literature 
since the company does not have the benefit of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost  because of the company s net operating loss position  this change will have no immediate impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
outlook the company s performance is directly related to semiconductor manufacturers levels of capital expenditures to open new fabrication facilities and expand existing ones  as well as operational improvements implemented by the company in recent quarters 
the level of capital expenditures by these manufacturers depends upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and the products utilizing them  the available manufacturing capacity in manufacturers fabrication facilities  and the ability of manufacturers to increase productivity in existing facilities without incurring additional capital expenditures 
during september  the company started to see a slowdown in capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers and pushouts of anticipated shipments to customers and customer orders to at least the first half of the company  based on ongoing discussions with its customers of their future plans and requirements  is currently forecasting that revenues will remain flat in the first quarter of as compared to the quarter ended december  on february   the company announced that net revenues excluding sen for the first quarter of are forecast in the range of million to million 
gross margins are projected in the range of to 
the company expects to earn between and per share 
results for the first quarter will be impacted negatively by restructuring and relocation costs of to million to per share 
the company also expects the contribution from sen for the quarter to decrease significantly due to the declining market in japan 
it is difficult to predict the company s customers capital spending plans since they can change very quickly 
at the company s current sales level  each sale  or failure to make a sale  could have a material effect on the company s results of operations in a particular quarter 
risk factors some of the matters discussed in this filing contain forward looking statements regarding future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those described by such statements
