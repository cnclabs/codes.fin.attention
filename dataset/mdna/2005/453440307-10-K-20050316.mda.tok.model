insurance reserves the company maintains loss reserves to cover its estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  including legal and other fees as well as a portion of the company s general expenses  for reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period 
the company computes insurance reserves primarily using the net premium method based on anticipated investment yield  mortality morbidity on health insurance and withdrawals 
liabilities for insurance reserves on certain short term medical coverages were computed using completion factors and expected loss ratios derived from actual historical premium and claim data 
these methods are widely used in the life and health insurance industry to estimate the liabilities for insurance reserves 
inherent in these calculations are management and actuarial judgments and estimates which could significantly impact the ending reserve liabilities and  consequently  operating results

liquidity insurance group the insurance group normally provides cash flow from i operations  ii the receipt of scheduled principal payments on its portfolio of fixed income securities  and iii earnings on investments 
such cash flow is used partially to finance liabilities for insurance reserves 
these liabilities represent long term and short term obligations which are calculated using certain assumed interest rates 
asset quality the nature and quality of insurance company investments must comply with all applicable statutes and regulations which have been promulgated primarily for the protection of policyholders 
of the aggregate carrying value of the insurance group s investment assets  approximately was invested in investment grade fixed income securities  cash and cash equivalents  resale agreements and policy loans and at december  also at such date  approximately of the company s fixed maturities were investment grade 
these investments carry less default risk and  therefore  lower interest rates than other types of fixed maturity investments 
at december  approximately 
of the carrying value of fixed maturities was invested in a non investment grade fixed income security investments in such securities have different risks than investment grade securities  including greater risk of loss upon default  and thinner trading markets 
the company does not have any mortgage loa ns or non performing fixed maturities 
investment impairments the company reviews its investments regularly and monitors its investments continually for impairments 
for the years ended december   and  the company recorded a realized loss for other than temporary impairments on securities not yet sold of 
million  million and million  respectively 
in  and  
million  million and million  respectively  of the loss relates to an interest related impairment recognized on certain interest only securities io securities resulting from unexpected prepayments of the mortgage obligations underlying the io securities due to falling interest rates 
the company has invested in io securities to help actively manage its interest rate exposure 
typically these securities account for less than of ihc s total portfolio assets and are rated aaa or better 
in a rising interest rate environment  io securities will increase in value which acts to mitigate the unrealized loss on the balance of the b ond portfolio 
in a decreasing interest rate environment  io securities will decline in value  but there will be an unrealized gain in the rest of the bond portfolio 
although these securities performed as expected  the company applies the methodology of emerging issues task force  recognition of interest income and impairment of purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets eitf in determining when an io security is considered other than temporarily impaired 
the company records realized losses under eitf when there is a decrease in expected cash flows combined with a decline in the io securities fair value below cost 
the company s gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities totaled million at december  substantially all of these securities were investment grade 
the unrealized losses  primarily within the corporate securities portfolio  have been evaluated in accordance with the company s policy and were determined to be temporary in nature at december  the company holds all fixed maturities as available for sale and accordingly marks all of its securities to fair value through accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
share repurchase program in june  the board of directors authorized an additional  share repurchase 
as of december    shares were still authorized to be repurchased under the plan 
this repurchase plan  like the  share repurchase authorized in  is a continuation of a program initiated in as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes information with respect to the share repurchase program maximum number number of average price of shares which month of shares of repurchased can be repurchase repurchased shares repurchased january february march april may june july august september october november december maximum number number of average price of shares which month of shares of repurchased can be repurchase repurchased shares repurchased january february march april may june july august september october november december risk management the company manages interest rate risk by seeking to maintain a portfolio with a duration and average life that falls within the band of the duration and average life of the applicable liabilities 
options may be utilized to modify the duration and average life of such assets  see note f iv of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following summarizes the estimated pre tax change in fair value based upon hypothetical parallel shifts in the us treasury yield curve of the fixed income portfolio assuming immediate changes in interest rates at specified levels at december  estimated estimated change change in interest rates fair value in fair value in millions basis point rise basis point rise base scenario basis point decline basis point decline the company monitors its investment portfolio on a continuous basis and believes that the liquidity of the insurance group will not be adversely affected by its current investments 
this monitoring includes the maintenance of an asset liability model that matches current insurance liability cash flows with current investment cash flows 
this is accomplished by first creating an insurance model of the company s in force policies using current assumptions on mortality  lapses and expenses 
then  current investments are assigned to specific insurance blocks in the model using appropriate prepayment schedules and future reinvestment patterns 
the results of the model specify whether the investments and their related cash flows can support the related current insurance cash flows 
additionally  various scenarios are developed changing interest rates and other related assumptions 
these scenarios help evaluate the market risk due to changing interest rates in relation to the business of the insurance group 
in the company s analysis of the asset liability model  a to basis point change in interest rates on the insurance group s liabilities would not be expected to have a material adverse effect on the company 
with respect to its liabilities  if interest rates were to increase  the risk to the company is that policies would be surrendered and assets would need to be sold 
this is not a material exposure to the company since a large portion of the insurance group s interest sensitive policies are burial policies that are not subject to the typical surrender patterns of other interest sensitive policies  and many of the insurance group s universal life and annuity policies come from liquidated companies which tend to exhibit lower surrender rates than such policies of continuing companies 
additionally  there are charges to help offset the benefits being surrendered 
if interest rates were to decrease substantially  the risk to the company is that some of its investment assets would be subject to early redemption 
this is not a material exposure because the company would have additional gains in its portfolio to help offset the future reduction of investment income 
with respect to its investments  the company employs from time to time as warranted investment strategies to mitigate interest rate and other market exposures 
balance sheet total investments and cash and cash equivalents increased million at december  largely due to the net cash of million provided by operating activities  cash of million received in the purchase of policy blocks  and net proceeds of million from the issuance of debt 
the decrease in insurance reserves health of million is due to the timing of claims payments 
the million increase in funds on deposit is primarily a result of the purchase of individual annuity policies in the second quarter of the company issued million in junior subordinated debt securities to a wholly owned unconsolidated trust during the million increase in total stockholders equity is due to net income generated in the year ended december   partially offset by a decrease in unrealized gains on investments and by the net purchases of the company s common stock 
the company had net receivables from reinsurers of million at december  substantially all of the business ceded to such reinsurers is of short duration 
all of such receivables are either due from the company s affiliate  independence american  highly rated companies or are adequately secured 
no allowance for doubtful accounts was necessary at december  as of december   the balance due from independence american is million 
corporate corporate derives its funds principally from i dividends from the insurance group  ii management fees from its subsidiaries  and iii investment income from corporate liquidity 
regulatory constraints historically have not affected the company s consolidated liquidity  although state insurance laws have provisions relating to the ability of the parent company to use cash generated by the insurance group 
total corporate liquidity cash  cash equivalents  resale agreements  fixed maturities  equity securities and partnership interests amounted to million at december  during  ihc repurchased  shares of common stock for million under its common stock repurchase program 
capital resources due to its strong capital ratios  broad licensing and excellent asset quality and credit worthiness  the insurance group remains well positioned to increase or diversify its current activities 
it is anticipated that future acquisitions or other expansion of operations will be funded internally from existing capital and surplus and parent company liquidity 
in the event additional funds are required  it is expected that they would be borrowed or raised in the public or private capital markets to the extent determined to be necessary or desirable 
in november  march and december  the company borrowed million  million and million  respectively  through pooled trust preferred issuances by subsidiary trusts 
in september  the company entered into a million line of credit  all of which was drawn down 
the cash proceeds of the line of credit and the trust preferred securities issued in were used to repay existing debt and for general corporate purpo ses 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item ihc enters into a variety of contractual obligations with third parties in the ordinary course of its operations 
these obligations  as of december   are set forth in the table below 
however  we do not believe that our cash flow requirements can be fully assessed based upon an analysis of these obligations 
future cash outflows  whether they are contractual obligations or not  also will vary based upon our future needs 
although some outflows are fixed  others depend on future events 
the company had the following expected contractual obligations relating to debt  trust preferred securities junior subordinated debt  non cancelable leases  insurance reserves and funds on deposit at december  junior funds subordinated insurance on debt debt leases reserves deposit total and thereafter totals in accordance with sfas no 
 the company may carry its portfolio of fixed income securities either as held to maturity carried at amortized cost  as trading securities carried at fair market value or as available for sale carried at fair market value 
the company has chosen to carry all of its debt securities as available for sale 
in  the company experienced a decrease in unrealized gains losses of million  net of deferred tax benefits of million and net of deferred policy acquisition costs of 
million in total stockholders equity  reflecting net unrealized losses of million at december  compared to net unrealized gains of

outlook the company anticipates continued favorable operating performance in as a result of i marketing of its new strategic health products including the rollover of the million block of employer sponsored group major medical administered by insurers administrator corporation iac  a market leader in sales of consumer driven medical plans to the small and medium size employer group maket  ii cross selling of products through controlled distribution sources  including its affiliates  health plan administrators  inc hpa and ca insurance services ca services  iii improved profitability of its medical stop loss business through stricter underwriting and anticipation of a somewhat harder market  iv the appointment of new stop loss mgus  and v acquisition of blocks of business 
ihc began marketing employer sponsored group major medical in one state in the first quarter of beginning in  the company is preparing to market this product in states 
standard life will also reinsure  with the intent of assuming  a million block of this business as of january  in addition  during  ihc will begin distributing short term medical  dental and vision products 
the major medical  dental and vision products  will be marketed through iac and ca services 
the short term medical and other products will be written through hpa  a market leader in these products 
these products  taken together  provide ihc with a full array of health products 
in addition  the company should generate cross selling opportunities for ihc s current life and health products and others currently under development 
ihc will continue to seek other strategic acquisitions of tpas and other distribution sources 
the company increased its average retention on medical stop loss written by standard life and madison life from in to in in  approximately of the company s medical stop loss business was underwritten by mgus in which the company or its affiliates have significant equity interests 
the company anticipates that these mgus will continue to contribute a high percentage of the insurance group s premiums in the medical stop loss line of business in in addition  the company exerts influence over its other mgus through its high retention of risk and by working with only a selected group of reinsurers that share ihc s commitment to underwriting discipline 
for all of its mgus  standard life and madison life regularly audit the mgus compliance with the company s underwriting  claims and policy issuance guidelines 
the medical stop loss market is generally cyclical in nature 
when a product experiences several consecutive years of underwriting profitability  it is not unusual for there to be more competitors entering that line which can increase pressure on pricing and create a softer market 
the medical stop loss market began to soften in  and less favorable conditions continued through despite these market conditions  the company produced profitable results in and  and expects continued profitability in as a result of these market conditions  the rate ihc is able to charge for medical stop loss increased at a lesser rate in recent years  however  increases in medical trend have also been held in check to a greater extent and deductibles and attachment points have increased 
this reduces ihc s overall risk exposure 
the company remains optimistic that it will continue to produce profitable results  however  its ability to grow the medical stop loss line in may be somewhat limited  although the company intends to appoint new mgus which would generate additional premiums 
ihc s new lines of business major medical  short term medical  dental and vision are less volatile than medical stop loss 
the company is optimistic that these lines will yield profitable results while producing significant growth 
madison life anticipates moderate growth in its group ltd  credit and term life lines as a result of increased production and improved loss ratios 
in  as a result of madison life s acquisition of a block with million in reserves  madison life began marketing an individual life product with annuity riders to military and civilian government employees  primarily through payroll deduction 
the company will continue to review acquisitions  and believes that it is well positioned to consummate additional acquisitions should the opportunity arise 
the company entered into an aggregate excess of loss retrocessional reinsurance agreement with a reinsurer for its medical stop loss business  effective as of january   pursuant to which the company will provide such reinsurer with a loss ratio cover to cap the reinsurer s losses  excluding certain losses  at a net loss ratio 
approximately million of net premium was ceded to such reinsurer during such period and the company charged of the premium ceded to the reinsurer for such coverage 
in addition  the company entered into a commutation agreement with this same reinsurer  pursuant to which  effective as of january   the reinsurer will return of the net premium collected to date with respect to the medical stop loss business ceded to such reinsurer  and the company will release most future liabilities of such reinsurer with respect to such business 
to date  approximately million of net premium was ceded to such reinsurer for such year 
madison national and independence american entered into a reinsurance agreement to protect independence american against certain losses occurring during the period from january  to december  in the event that independence american s claims  loss adjustment expenses  and incurred but not reported reserves net losses exceeds of the net premiums earned by independence american  then madison national will pay independence american an amount equal to the excess over the net losses 
in no event shall madison national pay independence american more than  independence american will pay madison national  quarterly  a premium of of net retained premium subject to a minimum premium of  and a maximum premium of  new accounting pronouncements on september   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued staff position no 
eitf issue  effective date of paragraphs of eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance for evaluating whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired and was originally to be effective for other than temporary impairment evaluations made in reporting periods beginning after june  july  for the company 
the delay in the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in eitf issue no 
does not suspend the requirement to recognize other than temporary impairments as required by existing authoritative literature 
subsequent to the issuance of staff position no 
eitf issue  the fasb announced plans for a full reconsideration of existing authoritative literature concerning other than temporary impairment of securities 
the outcome of this reconsideration and the impact  if any  on the company s impairment recognition cannot be predicted at this time 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised fasb r  share based payment  which supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions with employees and other third parties  eliminates the ability account for share based compensation transactions using apb  and requires that the compensation costs relating to such transactions be recognized in the statement of operations 
the revised statement is effective as of the first interim period beginning after june  and  therefore  the company will adopt the statement on july  as required 
sfas r applies to all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after that date 
additionally  beginning on the required effective date  compensation exp ense will be recognized for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service vesting has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under sfas for pro forma disclosures 
the impact of adoption cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend  in part  on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had the company adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the pro forma disclosure included in note r of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item safe harbor statement from time to time  information provided by the company  including but not limited to statements in this report  or other statements made by or on behalf of the company  may contain forward looking information within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements involve a number of risks  uncertainties and contingencies  many of which are beyond the company s control  which may cause actual results  performance or achievements to differ materially from those anticipated 
set forth below are important factors that could cause the company s results  performance or achievements to differ materially from those in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
risk factors affecting the company s operating results and financial condition the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that the company faces 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that the company currently deems immaterial may also impair the company s business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  the company s business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of the company s common stock could decline 
the company s results may fluctuate as a result of factors generally affecting the insurance and reinsurance industry the results of companies in the insurance and reinsurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties 
factors that affect the industry in general could also cause the company s results to fluctuate 
the industries and the company s financial condition and results of operations may be affected significantly by fluctuations in interest rates  inflationary pressures and other changes in the investment environment  which affect returns on invested capital and may impact the ultimate payout of loss amounts  rising levels of actual costs that are not known by companies at the time they price their products  losses related to terrorist activities  random acts of violence or declared or undeclared war  changes in reserves resulting from different types of claims that may arise and the development of judicial interpretations relating to the scope of insurers liability  and the overall level of economic activity and the competitive environment in the industry 
if the rating agencies downgrade the company s insurance companies  the company s results of operations and competitive position in the industry may suffer ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies 
standard life is rated a excellent and madison life is rated a excellent by am best company  inc best 
best s ratings reflect its opinions of an insurance company s financial strength  operating performance  strategic position  and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and are not evaluations directed to investors 
the ratings of standard life and madison life are subject to periodic review by best 
if best reduces either or both madison life s or standard life s ratings from its current levels  the company s business could be adversely affected 
the company s loss reserves are based on an estimate of its future liability  and if actual claims prove to be greater than the company s reserves  its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected the company maintains loss reserves to cover its estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  including legal and other fees as well as a portion of the company s general expenses  for reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period 
because setting reserves is inherently uncertain  the company cannot be sure that current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 
if the company s reserves are insufficient to cover its actual losses and loss adjustment expenses  the company would have to augment its reserves and incur a change to its earnings  and these charges could be material 
reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability 
rather  reserves represent an estimate of what the company expects the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost 
these estimates  which generally involve actuarial projections  are based on the company s assessment of facts and circumstances then known  as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity  frequency  judicial theories of liability and other factors 
these variables are affected by both internal and external events  such as changes in claims handling procedures  inflation  judicial trends and legislative changes 
many of these items are not directly quantifiable in advance 
additionally  there may be a significant reporting lag between the occurrence of the insured event and the time it is reported to the company 
the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities  particularly those in which the various considerations affecting the type of claim are subject to change and in which long periods of time may elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made 
reserve estimates are continually refined in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled 
adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are ch anged 
certain proposed federal and state legislation may  if adopted  adversely affect the company s employer medical stop loss business individuals who obtain health coverage through self insured plans cannot currently sue their employer in state court for punitive or compensatory damages  but can seek legal recourse in federal court where an employer can be ordered to cover a wrongfully denied benefit 
in the continuing debate over health care reform  certain federal and state legislation has been proposed which could have the effect of making plan sponsors  administrators  or certain other parties liable for punitive damages in state court 
while the company cannot predict whether any of these proposals will be adopted or what  if any  impact enactment of any of these would have on its employer medical stop loss business  the number of employers offering health benefits or choosing self insured plans could be reduced  plans could increase the portion paid by employees thereby reducing participation  pricing and coverage options could be affected  and the insurance group could be faced with greater liability exposures 
the company s inability to assess underwriting risk accurately could reduce its net income the company s success is dependent on its ability to assess accurately the risks associated with the businesses on which the risk is retained 
if the company fails to assess accurately the risks it retains  the company may fail to establish the appropriate premium rates and the company reserves may be inadequate to cover its losses  requiring augmentation of the company s reserves  which in turn could reduce the company s net income 
decreases in the fair market value of fixed income securities may greatly reduce the value of the company s investment portfolio  and as a result  the company s financial condition may suffer at december   million of the company s million investment portfolio was invested in fixed income securities 
the fair market value of these fixed income securities and the investment income from these fixed income securities fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions 
with respect to the company s investments in fixed income securities  the fair market value of these investments generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates  while net investment income realized by the company from future investments in fixed income securities will generally increase or decrease with interest rates 
in addition  actual net investment income and or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk  such as mortgage backed and other asset backed securities  may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations 
an investment has prepayment risk when there is a ri sk that the timing of cash flows that result from the repayment of principal might occur earlier than anticipated because of declining interest rates or later than anticipated because of rising interest rates 
historically  the impact of market fluctuations has affected the company s financial statements 
because all of the company s fixed income securities are classified as available for sale  changes in the fair market value of the company s securities are reflected in the company s accumulated other comprehensive income 
no adjustment is made for liabilities to reflect a change in interest rates 
therefore  interest rate fluctuations and economic conditions could adversely affect the company s stockholders equity  total comprehensive income and or cash flows 
if the company fails to comply with extensive state and federal regulations  the company will be subject to penalties  which may include fines and suspension and which may adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition the company is subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision 
most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors 
this regulation  generally administered by a department of insurance in each state in which the company does business  relates to  among other things approval of policy forms and premium rates  standards of solvency  including risk based capital measurements  which are a measure developed by the national association of insurance commissioners and used by state insurance regulators to identify insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized  licensing of insurers and their agents  restrictions on the nature  quality and concentration of investments  restrictions on transactions between insurance companies and their affiliates  restrictions on the size of risks insurable under a single policy  requiring deposits for the benefit of policyholders  requiring certain methods of accounting  prescribing the form and content of records of financial condition required to be filed  and requiring reserves for unearned premium  losses and other purposes 
state insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies  holding company issues and other matters 
the insurance group s business depends on compliance with applicable laws and regulations and its ability to maintain valid licenses and approvals for its operations 
regulatory authorities have broad discretion to grant  renew  or revoke licenses and approvals 
regulatory authorities may deny or revoke licenses for various reasons  including the violation or regulations 
in some instances  the insurance group follows practices based on its interpretations of regulations  or those that it believes to be generally followed by the industry  which may be different from the requirements or interpretations of regulatory authorities 
if the insurance group does not have the requisite licenses and approvals and does not comply with applicable regulatory requirements  the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend the insurance group from carrying on some or all of its activities or otherwise penalize it 
that type of action could have a material adverse effect on the i nsurance group s business 
also  changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry whether federal  state or foreign  or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities  could have a material adverse effect on the insurance group s business
