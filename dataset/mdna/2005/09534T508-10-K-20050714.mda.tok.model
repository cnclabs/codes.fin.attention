our initial products  introduced in may of  utilized caching technology to improve user response time for accessing internet content 
these systems were used by service providers and enterprises throughout the world and we achieved a market leadership position 
by  the caching market began evolving into two distinct markets enterprises looking for proxy caches to securely connect employees to the internet  and service providers looking for increased bandwidth savings and response time for their subscribers 
during this timeframe  service provider customers represented the majority of our revenues 
however  we enhanced our competitive position in both of the aforementioned markets through internal development and acquisitions 
by early  the demand for our enterprise proxy caches was growing  while the service provider market decreased significantly 
in response to this trend  we accelerated our development and marketing efforts around our enterprise business  resulting in the launch of our proxysg products in february the blue coat family of proxy appliances is designed to address today s new business risks  which can include the risk of being sued by employees who witness inappropriate web surfing by their coworkers  viruses brought in via back door channels such as instant messaging and web based email  and network resource abuse due to

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventories  valuation of goodwill  valuation of long lived and identifiable intangible assets  restructuring liabilities  revenue recognition and related receivable allowances  warranty obligations  income taxes and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the current circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and such differences could be material 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the development and selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee 
we believe the accounting policies described below  among others  are the ones that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments  and therefore are critical to the understanding of our financial condition and results of operations inventories  valuation of goodwill  valuation of long lived and identifiable intangible assets  restructuring liabilities  revenue recognition and related receivable allowances  warranty obligations  income taxes  and contingencies 
inventories 
inventories consist of raw materials  work in process and finished goods 
inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method  after appropriate consideration has been given to obsolescence and inventory in excess of anticipated future demand 
in assessing the ultimate recoverability of inventories  we are required to make estimates regarding future customer demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional write offs and other charges against earnings may be required 
valuation of goodwill 
we perform goodwill impairment tests annually in our fourth quarter or whenever indicators of impairment are present 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
for the purposes of our fiscal annual impairment test  we considered our market capitalization on the date of our impairment test and determined that no impairment existed 
valuation of long lived and identifiable intangible assets 
we evaluate our long lived and identifiable intangible assets in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

we review our long lived assets  including property and equipment and identifiable intangible assets  for 
table of contents impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
events or changes in circumstances that could result in an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets or the strategy for our business and significant negative industry or economic trends 
impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its fair value as calculated on a discounted cash flow basis 
restructuring liabilities 
we have accrued various restructuring liabilities  through charges to restructuring expense  related to employee severance costs  facilities closure and lease abandonment costs  and contract termination costs in our consolidated financial statements 
our restructuring liabilities for facilities closure and lease abandonment costs include various assumptions  such as the time period over which abandoned facilities will be vacant  expected sublease terms  and expected sublease rates 
revenue recognition and related receivable allowances 
we recognize appliance and winproxy revenue upon delivery of the product  assuming that evidence of an arrangement between the customer and us exists  the fee to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
in the event we have future performance obligations or must obtain customer acceptance  revenue is deferred until the obligations are met or acceptance is obtained 
during the fiscal year ended april   we deferred certain revenue and related costs of revenue based on future obligations 
revenue and related cost of revenue resulting from shipments to our distributors who have certain stock rotation rights are deferred until a point of sale report is received from the distributor confirming that our products have been sold to a reseller or an end user 
for sales to resellers  revenue and related cost of revenues are recognized upon shipment based on our understanding that an end user has been identified at the time of shipment 
maintenance and subscription contract revenue is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the contract with the related service cost expensed as incurred 
maintenance and subscription contracts usually have a month duration but can extend to months 
unearned maintenance and subscription contract revenue is included in deferred revenue 
delivery is considered to have occurred for our appliances when the customer takes title to the product and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership 
winproxy software delivery is considered to have occurred when the software key is made available to the customer electronically 
when a sale involves multiple elements  we determine if these elements can be separated into multiple units of accounting 
the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value or using the residual method  if appropriate 
revenue for each element is then recognized when revenue recognition criteria for that element is met 
if we cannot establish fair value for any undelivered element  we would be required to recognize revenue for the whole arrangement at the time revenue recognition criteria for the undelivered element is met 
relative fair value for maintenance elements are determined based on substantive renewal rates 
we record the shipping costs in both revenue and cost of revenue when we bill our customers for shipping 
if we do not charge our customers for shipping  the costs incurred for shipping are reflected in cost of revenue but not recorded in revenue 
probability of collection is assessed on a customer by customer basis 
our customers are subjected to a credit review process that evaluates the customers financial condition and ability to pay for our products and services 
if it is determined from the outset of an arrangement that collection is not probable based upon our review process  revenue is not recognized until cash receipt 

table of contents we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer solvency  current economic and geographic trends  and changes in customer payment terms and practices when evaluating the adequacy of such allowance  and any changes are charged to general and administrative expense 
warranty obligations 
we accrue for warranty expenses as part of our cost of revenue at the time revenue is recognized and maintain an accrual for estimated future warranty obligations based upon the relationship between historical and anticipated warranty costs and revenue volumes 
if actual warranty expenses are greater than those projected  additional obligations and other charges against earnings may be required 
if actual warranty expenses are less than projected  prior obligations could be reduced providing a positive impact on our reported results 
we generally provide a one year warranty on hardware products and a day warranty on software products 
income taxes 
we use the liability method to account for income taxes as required by the fasb sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves determining our income tax expense benefit together with calculating the deferred income tax expense benefit related to temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes  such as deferred revenue or deductibility of certain intangible assets 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered through the generation of future taxable income and record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount we believe more likely than not will be realized 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
contingencies 
from time to time we are involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
if management believes that a loss arising from these matters is probable and can reasonably be estimated  we record the amount of the loss  or the minimum estimated liability when the loss is estimated using a range and no point within the range is more probable than any other 
as additional information becomes available  any potential liability related to these matters is assessed and the estimates are revised  if necessary 
litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties  and unfavorable rulings could occur

legal settlement fees on august   network caching technology llc nct filed suit against us and others in the united states district court for the northern district of california  alleging infringement of certain patents owned by nct

no such charges were recorded in fiscal years or to establish the value of the in process technology acquired from ositis  we used an income approach  which values an asset based on the earnings capacity of such asset considering the future cash flows that could potentially be generated by the asset over its estimated remaining life 
these cash flows were discounted to their present value using a discount rate of  theoretically equal to a rate that would provide sufficient return to a potential investor at an appropriate level of risk 
the present value of the cash flows over the life of the asset is summed to equal the estimated value of the asset 
restructuring charges the following summarizes restructuring reversal expense and changes in restructuring expense by fiscal year in thousands year ended april  restructuring reversal expense change in restructuring expense change in restructuring expense 
table of contents as discussed further under restructuring plans below  and in note restructuring accrual of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  we recorded million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  primarily related to facilities abandonment costs

interest income decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to lower average cash and investment balances as well as lower interest rates 
other income consists primarily of realized gains and losses on investments  foreign exchange gains or losses  banking fees  and non recurring gains or losses realized outside our normal course of business and  as such  is subject to variability

the foreign corporate income taxes result from our international expansion and the establishment of branches and subsidiaries in various jurisdictions 
we have incurred losses from our inception through the second quarter in fiscal management believes that  based on the history of such losses and other factors  the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize our deferred tax assets 
therefore  a full valuation allowance has been recorded against deferred tax assets at april   and the valuation allowance increased decreased by million  million and million during fiscal years  and  respectively

we also had federal and california research and other tax credit carryforwards of approximately million which will expire in fiscal years through if not utilized 
utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
such annual limitations could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization 
the events that may cause ownership changes in our net operating loss include  but are not limited to  a cumulative stock ownership change of greater than over a three year period 
our deferred tax assets  which have been offset by the valuation allowance  include deferred tax benefits associated with employee stock options and acquired net operating loss carryforwards 
deferred tax benefits associated with employee stock options of approximately million will be credited to additional paid in capital when realized 
deferred tax benefits associated with acquired net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  when realized  will first reduce goodwill and then non current identifiable intangible assets

table of contents stock compensation the following summarizes stock compensation expense included in the below cost classifications in the consolidated statement of operations for the years ended april   and  respectively in thousands year ended april  stock based compensation classified in cost of goods sold classified in operating expense research and development sales and marketing general and administrative subtotal we recorded stock compensation expense totaling million  million and million for the years ended april   and  respectively  which were included in various cost classifications in the consolidated statement of operations 
stock compensation expense reflects the amortization of deferred stock compensation  charges associated with stock options and warrants granted to non employees for services  and modifications to stock based awards for certain departed employees 
as a result of the acquisition of ositis on november   total deferred stock compensation of million was recorded in stockholders equity  of which approximately million was recognized in each of the fiscal years ending april  and in fiscal  we also recorded approximately million in expense related to the modification of the vesting terms for certain stock option grants included as part of a severance agreement with our former chief financial officer 
total stock compensation expense in fiscal decreased million from the prior year 
stock compensation expense decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of the reduction in deferred stock compensation associated with a reduction in headcount  partially offset in fiscal by an increase in expense due to stock awards committed to be issued to ositis software personnel employed by us after the acquisition 
deferred stock compensation from the cerberian acquisition was insignificant in fiscal we recorded deferred stock compensation of approximately million associated with the ositis acquisition 
we did not record any deferred stock compensation in fiscal our deferred stock compensation expense results from a variety of stock based transactions 
increases to our deferred stock compensation balance represent the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the stock option grant 
however  we have also completed other stock based transactions that impact deferred stock compensation  such as acquisitions in which the outstanding options of the acquired entity are assumed  instances where modifications are made to the terms and conditions of outstanding stock option grants  and acquisitions where we have committed to issuing stock option awards to employees from the acquired entity  who have joined blue coat 
deferred stock compensation is amortized to stock compensation expense over the option vesting period recognized immediately if there is no vesting period  or recognized over the term that the award is earned 
in addition to amortization of deferred stock compensation  stock compensation expense includes charges associated with stock options and warrants granted to non employees for services  and modifications to stock based awards for certain departed employees 
our policy is to amortize ositis related deferred stock compensation using a straight line method 
deferred stock compensation recorded in connection with our november initial public offering  certain below market option grants in fiscal and unvested options assumed in our december acquisition of entera are amortized using a graded method 
graded amortization methods result in greater amortization in earlier years  including fiscal 
table of contents although deferred stock compensation relating to shares issued to former ositis employees was fully amortized in fiscal  we may record additional deferred stock compensation and or stock compensation expense in the future if management decides to grant stock options with exercise prices lower than fair market value of the stock  assume outstanding options in future acquisitions  issue stock awards in future acquisitions  modify outstanding stock awards subsequent to their date of grant  or enter into other transactions that may require the recognition of additional compensation 
restructuring plans as of april   substantially all actions under the february  august  and february restructuring plans had been completed  except for payment of future rent obligations of million  which are to be paid in cash through fiscal year the following table summarizes activity related to restructuring activity during the three years ended april  in thousands abandoned lease space accrual severance related accrual contract termination and facilities closure accrual total balances at april  cash payments additions reversals balances at april  cash payments additions balances at april  cash payments reversals balances as of april  less current portion included in current liabilities long term restructuring accrual in fiscal  we reduced our restructuring accrual by  related to a revised estimate of real estate taxes on one of the leased facilities and by  due to contract termination costs which were lower than originally estimated 
during fiscal  we increased our restructuring accruals for abandoned lease space by million to reflect additional revisions of market trend information provided by a commercial real estate broker 
during fiscal  we increased the restructuring accruals by million for abandoned lease space  mainly due to the loss of our tenant in a leased building in sunnyvale  california 
we also reduced our estimates for contract termination costs by million during fiscal  as we were able to negotiate lower settlement amounts than originally estimated 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we believe the existing cash  cash equivalents  and cash generated from operations  if any  will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next months  including working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
we may choose at any time to raise additional capital to strengthen our financial position  facilitate expansion  and pursue strategic investments or to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise 
april  in thousands cash and cash equivalents restricted investments percentage of total assets year ended april  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities cash provided by used in investing activities cash provided by financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents since our inception  we have financed our operations and capital expenditures through private sales of preferred and common stock  bank loans  equipment leases  and an initial public offering of our common stock 
during fiscal and we also financed our operations and capital expenditures through cash provided by operating activities 
during the year ended april   we generated million in cash from operating activities compared to million in the prior year 
the sharp increase in cash provided by operating activities is a result of higher net income driven by the growth in net revenue 
working capital sources of cash included a decrease in accounts payable of million and an increase in deferred revenue of million 
accounts payable increased during the year ended april  as a result of a higher volume of business 
deferred revenue increased as a result of increased sales of service and support 
working capital uses of cash included increases in accounts receivable balance of million  prepaid expenses and other current assets of million  and a decrease in accrued liabilities of million 
accounts receivable increased as a result of significantly higher net revenue during fiscal as reflected in an increase in our day sales outstanding from at april  to at april   partially offset by increased collection efforts 
accrued liabilities decreased over the prior year primarily as a result of cash payments made against the restructuring accrual recorded in prior years 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended april  compared with million net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended april  net cash used in investing activities for the year ended april  included million for the acquisition of cerberian and million for the remaining payments from the ositis acquisition  as well as purchase of property and equipment of million 
net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was million  primarily due to sales of short term investments of million partially offset by purchases of property and equipment of million and million used to acquire ositis 
in the future  we expect that any cash in excess of current requirements will continue to be invested in short term investment grade  interest bearing securities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million and million for the years ended april  and the net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended april  was from the issuance of common stock through employee stock compensation plans 
the net cash provided by our financing activities for fiscal was primarily due to a private equity financing and the issuance of common stock through 
table of contents employee stock compensation plans 
on september   we raised million from the sale of  shares of our common stock to investment funds and an individual affiliated with sprout group  a venture capital affiliate of credit suisse first boston 
our long term strategy is to maintain a minimum amount of cash and cash equivalents for operational purposes and to invest the remaining amount of our cash in interest bearing and highly liquid cash equivalents and marketable debt securities 
as of april   we had a total of million in cash equivalents and short term investments  as well as million in restricted investments  providing us with a total cash position of million 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances as of april  and cash generated from operations  if any  will provide sufficient capital to meet our requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  should prevailing economic conditions and or financial  business and other factors beyond our control adversely affect our estimates of our future cash requirements  or if cash is used for unanticipated purposes  we may need additional capital sooner than expected 
although we cannot guarantee that planned results will be obtained in fiscal or that sufficient debt or equity capital will be available to us under acceptable terms  if at all  we believe that our planned cash flow assumptions can be realized 
however  if we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us  we could be unable to continue our operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are subject to certain market risks  including changes in exchange rates and interest rates 
we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposures to exchange and interest rate risks  and we are not a party to any risk management transactions 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
as of april   we had approximately million invested primarily in certificates of deposit and fixed rate  short term corporate and us government debt securities which are included in cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheets 
we maintain a strict investment policy  which is intended to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we develop products in the united states and sell them throughout the world 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
since all of our sales are currently made in united states dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
if any of the events described above were to occur  our net revenue could be seriously impacted  since a significant portion of our net revenue are derived from international operations 
for the fiscal years  and  approximately  and  respectively  of our total net revenue were derived from customers outside of north america 
in contrast  substantially all of the expenses of operating our foreign subsidiaries are incurred in foreign currencies 
as a result  our us dollar earnings and net cash flows from international operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
however  we do not consider the market risk associated with our international operations to be material 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes
