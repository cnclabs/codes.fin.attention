i a summary of consolidated earnings losses net losses in were million compared to net earnings of million in  although included approximately million of gains on asset sales and non recurring items related to the sale of the steam packet 
fully diluted losses were per class a share and per class b share 
in addition to the absence of the gain on sale of ferry assets  the main reasons for the decline in earnings were the start up losses of silja incurred in on a new ferry service in the baltic sea  a reduction in compensation received by gner from network rail and one off charges for settlements with the uk strategic rail authority sra 
however  the underlying performance of the container and rail operations remained strong  scl has successfully bid for a renewal of the gner rail franchise and management has undertaken programs to address the decline in ferry earnings

of this decrease  million related to a reduction in net gains on asset sales and non recurring charges and million to the absence of the steam packet s earnings in ferry operations in  while in six months of earnings were included in these operations  resulting in a comparative decrease of million 
the decrease of million consisted of reduced earnings from ferry operations of million  rail operations of million  and other scl activities of million and increased corporate costs of million  partly offset by increased earnings from container operations of million  including earnings from the investment in ge seaco 
the reduction in ferry operations profits of million related to silja operations million  hoverspeed s cross channel services million  the belfast troon service million  and charter and other ferry activities million 
the decline in silja s earnings was due to increased capacity provided by competitors on a number of routes and start up losses of a new route to russia which performed below management s expectations 
scl is taking a number of actions to address the earnings decline including systems development to enhance revenue growth and promote cost reductions  redeployment  chartering or sale of underperforming vessels  and refurbishing the core vessels on the helsinki stockholm route 
the losses on other ferry operations were mainly due to increased competition and higher operating costs 
in order to reduce the losses  scl is redeploying capacity from loss making uk routes and increasing its presence in the mediterranean  especially the greek market 
a decision to cease operating the belfast troon service was made in january an impairment charge of million in respect of assets used for this service is included in the loss on other ferry activities in rail operations had another excellent year operationally with revenue up million but recorded reduced profits because of adverse changes in network rail s compensation regime from april  the absence of a gain in from a settlement with network rail and charges of million relating to the july sra settlement and other contractual payments agreed with the sra during that relate to the current franchise agreement expiring in april gner has been successful in its bid to renew its franchise to operate intercity east coast main line rail services 
a new ten year franchise with the sra was signed in march scl is optimistic about its possible bids to win two further rail franchises 
the increase in container operations profits of million reflected strong demand worldwide for container leasing and was mainly due to scl s equity accounted investment in ge seaco 
net finance costs decreased in by million reflecting a lower net interest expense of million offset in part by reduced foreign exchange gains of million 
the reduction in interest expense was largely due to a lower debt level and the redemption of relatively expensive debt 
the tax charge decreased in by million 
a change in law in finland allowed silja to claim a one off tax deduction in in respect of previously non deductible costs 
the tax benefit related to this deduction amounted to million 
net earnings compared to net earnings in were million higher than in and earnings before net finance costs increased by million 
within the increase in earnings before net finance costs  million related to an increase in net gains on asset sales and non recurring charges and million arose from the strengthening of sterling and the euro against the dollar 
also included million of earnings in the second half of the year in ferry operations from steam packet  which was sold in july  and million relating to leisure operations reflecting the effect of scl s reduced share of oeh results following the deconsolidation of oeh in the fourth quarter of 
after adjusting for these items  scl s earnings before net finance costs were materially consistent with rail operations increased by million and container operations improved by million but these were largely offset by a decline in ferry operations of million and corporate costs of million 
container operations included a million improvement from scl s share in earnings of ge seaco and a million improvement in other container operations 
net finance costs decreased in by million or by million if adjusted for the adverse effect of the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar amounting to million 
the decrease was mainly due to a reduction in outstanding senior notes and lower interest rates 
there was no minority interest charge in compared with a charge of million in  relating to oeh million and silja million 
i b segment analysis of earnings losses before net finance costs ferry operations i silja year ended december  year compared with variance effect of foreign exchange net variance m m m m m m revenue operating costs sg a expenses depreciation and amortization earnings before net finance costs silja compared to silja s earnings declined due to increased capacity of the competition on a number of its routes  and the redeployment of the finnjet on a new route to russia which performed below expectations 
this start up had a negative earnings impact of million 
silja s earnings before net finance costs fell by million to million 
scl is taking a number of steps to address the fall in earnings as described above and benefits from these actions can be expected to begin to be realized in the revenue decrease of million reflected an overall net reduction in passenger volumes of  caused by the transfer of the finnjet from the helsinki tallin rostock service in to rostock tallin st 
petersburg for the summer months of the effect of this redeployment was to reduce silja s total passenger carryings by and revenue by million 
retail yields declined due to the absence of duty free sales on routes to estonia after its entry into the european union 
this effect was compounded by the reduction of on shore finnish alcohol duties which meant that retail prices on board had to be further reduced to maintain the price differential sufficient to encourage passengers to buy on board 
however  the decline in retail yield was offset by an increase in ticket yield and on board food and beverage spend 
there was a increase in passenger volumes on the superseacat services to tallinn due to day traffic generated by estonia s entry into the eu the extra volumes included higher numbers of both business travelers commuters and leisure travelers tourists and shoppers 
revenue on helsinki tallinn was up million 
the main helsinki stockholm route performed well as did freight business with revenue up by million and million  respectively 
the turku stockholm kapellskar routes suffered from slightly lower passenger volumes but revenue remained steady 
silja s operating costs reflected a reduction of million mainly due to the lay up of finnjet in the fourth quarter 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million in which reflected capital expenditure for the year of million 
silja compared to silja was acquired in april from which date scl has consolidated its operating results 
therefore  the year reflects the consolidation of silja s results for the eight months to december   and scl s share in silja in the first four months of is shown as a loss on equity investments of million 
as a result of this  increases in revenues and costs for and are not comparable on a consistent basis 
before adjustment for the effect of foreign exchange  silja earnings before net finance costs of million in compared with million in  a reduction of million 
this reduction is explained by non recurring items in of million  comprising income received from a charter termination and from a settlement of a dispute under another charter 
after adjusting for the impact of these items and the losses of the first four months of  underlying earnings rose by million 
ii other ferry operations year ended december  year compared with variance effect of foreign exchange net variance m m m m m m revenue operating costs sg a expenses depreciation and amortization losses before net finance costs earnings losses by operation uk ferries excluding steam packet steam packet charters other ferry operations losses before net finance costs uk ferry operations included english channel routes dover calais and newhaven dieppe and the irish sea route belfast troon

losses on uk ferry routes increased by million consisting of million on dover calais  million on newhaven dieppe and million on belfast troon 
losses from charters and other ferry operations increased by million  largely as a result of increased expenditure on the refitting of vessels 
the decrease in both revenues and operating costs was mainly due to the absence of the steam packet and the implementation of a seasonal operation on uk routes in scl is reviewing the deployment of its ferry fleet to assess profitable opportunities for and beyond 
a decision was taken in january to cease operating the belfast troon route and in march the newhaven dieppe route 
a new charter has been signed for one of the vessels in greece and negotiations are in progress for further charters in the mediterranean 
uk ferries dover calais route this route moved to a seasonal operation at the end of to avoid the losses that have been incurred historically during the winter months 
in operations did not commence until march  while in the service operated throughout the first quarter 
the route recorded a loss of million in compared to a loss of million in other factors which impacted revenue on this route were the late delivery from refit of a third craft in the peak third quarter period and price competition from eurotunnel and a new operator providing services between dover and boulogne 
additionally  there was a decline in passenger spend yields reflecting the increase in french tobacco duties which impacted on board sales 
the reduction in operating costs from the move to a seasonal operation was partly offset by an increase in fuel costs which rose by million over the equivalent period in newhaven dieppe route this route reported a loss of million in compared to a loss of million in revenue decreased by million  partly the result of adverse weather conditions in the second quarter and partly the effect of reduced passenger volumes due to increased competition from other operators and budget airlines 
costs were controlled effectively  and decreased by million notwithstanding the adverse effect of an increase in fuel costs 
in march  scl decided to terminate the service and is seeking to redeploy the affected ship 
belfast troon route after a poor year in and the prospect of insufficient profitability  scl has discontinued this route in as a result of this decision  an impairment charge relating to associated operational assets of million has been recognized in the route made a loss of million excluding the impairment charge in following a loss of million in it is estimated that the closure of the belfast troon route will result in a further charge of approximately million in the first quarter of to comprise of staff redundancy and facility exit costs 
steam packet routes the absence of the steam packet business which was sold in july resulted in a revenue decrease of million and reductions in operating costs  sg a expenses and depreciation of million  million and million  respectively 
charter other ferry operations new york harbor routes there was an increase in seastreak s revenue of million which included the benefit of two new vessels being added in october and february this was partly offset by the effect of sailings lost in february due to ice conditions in the harbor 
seastreak s earnings decreased from a million profit in to a million loss in due to a combination of insufficient passenger volumes on the new vessels  higher fuel costs and poor weather conditions 
management is taking steps to align capacity with demand and is in negotiations to charter out one of the vessels 
charter operations and central costs charter operations and divisional costs suffered from increased costs of million as a result of increased refit costs on the fast ferry fleet 
a revenue increase of million reflected a new charter of a vessel 
other ferries compared to other ferry operations recorded reduced losses in from million to million  excluding the discontinued steam packet ferry business and after adjusting for foreign exchange movements 
excluding the effects of the absence of the steam packet s revenues for the last six months of for the same period in this amounted to million and foreign exchange movements  revenue decreased by million 
this decrease mainly related to reduced revenue from hoverspeed s cross channel services due to the cessation of the dover ostend route at the end of excluding the steam packet  the decline in revenue was offset by cost savings of million mainly due to the closure of the dover ostend route 
rail operations year ended december  year compared with variance effect of foreign exchange net variance m m m m m m revenue operating costs sg a expenses depreciation and amortization earnings before net finance costs rail compared to gner had an excellent year operationally  but was adversely affected by changes in the compensation regime with network rail and charges arising from contractual settlements with the sra 
in march  gner was awarded a new ten year franchise to operate the intercity east coast main line rail service 
the new franchise will be in direct continuation of gner s existing franchise which terminates on april  the new franchise has a break clause after seven years if gner fails to meet certain performance criteria 
gner is currently bidding for the integrated kent commuter franchise and intends to bid for the greater western franchise in rail revenue increased by million in mainly due to an increase in passenger volumes of  both peak and off peak 
a revenue management system was implemented during the year  to ensure that ticket quotas are allocated to optimize revenue 
this particularly lifted off peak volume and helped to improve capacity utilization 
there was small slippage in yield as a result 
the year has seen a shift in sales channels  with internet and self service channels proving particularly popular 
website revenue increased by on  and use of self service ticket machines increased by 
gner also benefited from rolling stock refurbishment funded by the lessor of the equipment 
the improvements in revenue were partly offset by the effect of million received from network rail in the first quarter of in settlement negotiations for disruption to gner s rail services following the uk rail regulator s ruling in gner s favor

this decrease was mainly due to reduced compensation from network rail and other claims for disruption to gner s rail services  partly offset by an improvement in ticket revenues from increased passenger volumes 
operating expenses decreased by million due largely to reduced track access charges  including the effect of higher contractual compensation payments received from network rail 
an increase in rail sg a expenses of million mainly related to staff costs  including redundancy costs and insurance charges

vi million revolving credit facility this facility  provided by a bank syndicate and principally secured by the pledge of a portion of the company s shares in oeh  is available for general corporate purposes and carries an interest rate of above libor 
the final maturity of any amounts borrowed is july  and million was outstanding at december  the facility has covenants which require scl i to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth as defined  ii not to exceed a specified leverage ratio and iii to meet certain cash maintenance requirements 
ii e leverage  foreign currency fluctuations at december   scl s consolidated long term indebtedness was  million  million  its consolidated shareholders equity totalled million million and it had redeemable preferred shares amounting to million million 
the terms of scl s indebtedness described above permit scl to incur substantial additional indebtedness from time to time 
the degree to which scl is leveraged may affect its ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  product and service development and general corporate purposes  to utilize cash flow from operations for purposes other than debt service  and to overcome seasonal or cyclical variations in its business 
the ability of scl to satisfy its obligations and to reduce its debt is dependent upon the future performance of scl  which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  including factors beyond the control of scl 
the acquisition by scl of new assets  both for growth as well as for replacement  is capital intensive 
the availability of new capital to finance these expenditures depends on prevailing market conditions and the acceptability of financing terms offered to scl 
management believes that capital expected to be available to scl under various lines of credit  financing agreements  equity offerings and other sources  and from dispositions of existing assets and properties  as well as cash generated from operations  should be sufficient to meet scl s capital requirements in and for the foreseeable future 
no assurance  however  can be given that financing will continue to be available  or available on acceptable terms 
approximately of scl s consolidated long term indebtedness at december  accrued interest at rates that fluctuate with prevailing interest rates and  accordingly  increases in such rates may increase scl s interest payment obligations 
at december   scl had two interest rate swaps in place with financial institutions in order to manage its floating interest rate exposure  thereby reducing the proportion of fluctuating interest rate indebtedness to 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk substantial portions of scl s revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  especially sterling and euro 
a large part of scl s rail and ferry businesses operates in and around great britain and certain corporate costs and sg a expenses of scl relate to its london offices 
fluctuations in the values of these currencies in us dollar terms may affect scl s financial condition and results of operations 
the impact of these fluctuations is mitigated to the extent that scl has both revenue and expenses denominated in the same currencies 
if revenue and expense items become imbalanced  scl may enter into forward foreign exchange contracts from time to time in order to hedge the imbalance 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and note to the financial statements 
iii critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion of scl s financial condition and results of operations is based on its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of those financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are those that reflect significant judgments or uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
management believes the following are scl s most critical accounting policies 
carrying values of long lived assets and goodwill management evaluates the recoverability of long lived assets  including containers  ships  property and finite lived intangible assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
these evaluations include analyses based on the undiscounted cash flows generated by the underlying assets  profitability information including estimated future operating results  trends or other determinants 
if the value of the asset determined by these evaluations is less than its carrying amount  a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the related business may indicate an inability to recover the carrying value of the assets  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill must be evaluated at least annually for impairment 
goodwill impairment testing under sfas no 
is performed in two steps  first  the determination of impairment based upon the fair value of a reporting unit as compared with its carrying value and  second  if there is an impairment  the measurement of the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
as of december  and  scl determined the carrying value of all its operating goodwill and its indefinite lived intangible asset had not been impaired 
to determine fair value  scl relied on valuation models utilizing discounted cash flows 
depreciation containers and ships are recorded at cost and  after allowance for salvage value  are depreciated over their estimated useful lives by the straight line method 
the estimated useful lives and salvage values for containers are generally years and  respectively  and for ships generally to years and to  respectively 
real estate and other fixed assets are recorded at cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives by the straight line method 
the depreciation rates on freehold buildings range from to years and on machinery and other remaining assets from to years 
leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the respective lease terms 
pensions scl employees participate in a number of defined benefit pension plans 
scl s pension plans are accounted for using actuarial valuations required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions  which include discount rates  health care cost trends and rates  salary growth  long term return on plan assets and mortality rates 
management believes that a long term return on plan assets in is reasonable despite the recent market volatility in which scl s plan assets had investment returns of approximately for the year ended december  and investment returns of approximately for the year ended december  in determining the expected long term rate of return on assets  management has evaluated input from scl s actuaries and financial advisors  including their review of anticipated future long term performance of individual asset classes and the consideration of the appropriate asset allocation strategy given the anticipated requirements of the respective plans to determine the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested 
the projected returns by these consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices  including fixed interest rate gilts of long term duration since the plans are predominantly in the uk scl s expected long term rate of return is based on a planned asset allocation of in equity investments  with an expected long term rate of return of  and in fixed income investments  with an expected long term rate of return of 
scl s actual asset allocation as of december  was in line with planned allocations 
management regularly reviews scl s actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances investments to targeted allocations when considered appropriate 
while the analysis gives appropriate consideration to recent fund performance and historical returns  the assumption is primarily a long term  prospective rate 
management will continue to evaluate the expected rate of return at least annually  and will adjust as necessary 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  pension expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on scl s consolidated financial statements 
lowering the expected long term rate of return on scl s pension plans by from to would have increased pension expense for by approximately million 
tax assets scl maintains a valuation allowance to reduce its gross deferred tax assets to reflect the amount that would likely be realized based upon scl s estimates of income 
if scl s future operations differed from those in the estimates  scl may need to increase or decrease the valuation allowance  which could affect its reported operations 
contingencies scl is subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
scl considers the likelihood of a loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability as well as its ability reasonably to estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
management regularly evaluates current available information to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 
iv recent accounting pronouncements scl s adoption of recent accounting pronouncements is described in note r to the financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as noted under leverage  foreign currency fluctuations in item management s discussion and analysis above  scl is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  as well as fuel price movements 
these exposures are monitored and managed by scl as part of its overall risk management program which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to mitigate potentially material adverse effects on scl s consolidated earnings and cash flow 
as part of this management  scl enters into interest rate and foreign currency swap contracts  foreign currency forward exchange contracts and fuel price hedge agreements from time to time 
see note to the financial statements item below 
scl does not use market risk sensitive financial instruments for trading purposes 
the following discussion includes sensitivity analyses for hypothetical changes in the interest rates  exchange rates or fuel commodity prices that scl is exposed to 
in all cases  the hypothetical change was calculated based on a parallel shift in the forward price curve existing at december  the forward curve takes into account the time value of money and the future expectations regarding the value of the underlying interest rate  currency and commodity 
the market risk relating to interest rates arises mainly from scl s financing activities 
scl s earnings are affected by changes in interest rates on borrowings  principally based on us dollar libor and euribor  and on short term cash investments 
management assesses scl s market risk based on changes in interest rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
if interest rates increased by  with all other variables held constant  scl s annual net finance costs  as reported on its statements of consolidated operations  would have increased by approximately million based on its variable rate borrowings and interest rate swap agreements outstanding at december  million 
changes in interest rates also impact the fair value of scl s fixed rate debt 
if interest rates increased by  with all other variables held constant  the fair value of scl s fixed rate debt would have decreased by approximately million based on amounts outstanding at december  million 
the market risk relating to foreign currencies arises from buying  selling and financing in currencies other than the us dollar  principally uk sterling and euros 
management anticipates this foreign currency exchange rate risk will remain a market exposure for the foreseeable future 
certain non us subsidiaries of the company borrow in local foreign currencies  and scl may enter into forward exchange contracts relating to purchases denominated in foreign currencies in order to manage and mitigate exchange rate risk 
scl had no currency swap agreement in place at december  management uses a sensitivity analysis to assess the changes in the values of the us dollar on foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities 
the primary assumption used in these models is a hypothetical weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against scl s currency exposure at december  as a result of this analysis  management determined that the impact on monetary assets and liabilities of a change in foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the us dollar would amount to approximately million 
scl is also exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices  as an increase in the price of fuel would result in lower earnings and increased cash outflows 
management enters into fuel swap contracts from time to time to procure a portion of scl s fuel requirements and to hedge its exposure to volatility in fuel market prices 
management uses a sensitivity analysis to assess the changes in fuel prices 
the primary assumption used in this model is a hypothetical increase in the price of fuel at december  as a result of this analysis  management determined that the impact on operations and cash flows of a hypothetical increase in fuel prices would not be material to the operations and cash flows of scl
