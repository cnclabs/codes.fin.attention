the purchase and sales agreement contains a clause which will require the company to pay additional purchase price of up to  if certain sales levels are achieved 
the earnout provision is effective over a period of months and expires in december at january   no additional consideration was owed to the sellers 

table of contents a summary of the company s contractual obligations and commitments as of january  is as follows in millions payment due with in year years thereafter operating leases purchase obligations total purchase obligations include amounts committed under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders for goods and services with defined terms as to price  quantity  delivery and termination liability 
the company is subject to contingencies  including legal proceedings and claims arising out of its businesses that cover a wide range of matters  including  among others  contract and employment claims  workers compensation claims  product liability  warranty and modification  adjustment or replacement of component parts of units sold 
the company provides accruals for direct costs associated with the estimated resolution of contingencies at the earliest date at which it is deemed probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated 
costs accrued have been estimated and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and outcomes 
while it is impossible to ascertain the ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to contingent liabilities  including lawsuits  the company believes that the aggregate amount of such liabilities  if any  in excess of amounts provided or covered by insurance  will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the company 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular future period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or strategies related to these contingencies or changes out of the company s control 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
certain of the company s accounting policies require the application of judgment in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
the company periodically evaluates the judgments and estimates used for its critical accounting policies to ensure that such judgments and estimates are reasonable for its interim and year end reporting requirements 
these judgments and estimates are based on the company s historical experience  current trends and information available from other sources  as appropriate 
if different conditions result from those assumptions used in the company s judgments  the results could be materially different from the company s estimates 
the company s critical accounting policies include revenue recognition the majority of the company s product sales are recorded at the time of shipment  when legal title has transferred and risk of loss passes to the customer  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in accordance with the requirements in staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
when a sale arrangement involves training or installation  the deliverables in the arrangement are evaluated to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting in accordance with sab and eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this evaluation occurs at inception of the arrangement and as each item in the arrangement is delivered 
the total fee from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on its relative fair value 
fair value for each element is established generally based on the sales price charged when the same or similar element is sold separately 

table of contents revenue is recognized when revenue recognition criteria for each unit of accounting are met 
when other significant obligations remain after products are delivered  revenue is recognized only after such obligations are fulfilled 
all of the company s equipment contains embedded operating systems and data management software which is included in the purchase price of the equipment 
the software is deemed incidental to the systems as a whole as it is not sold separately or marketed separately and its production costs are minor as compared to those of the hardware system 
returns and customer credits are infrequent and are recorded as a reduction to sales 
rights of return are not included in sales arrangements 
revenue associated with products that contain specific customer acceptance criteria is not recognized before the customer acceptance criteria are satisfied 
discounts from list prices are recorded as a reduction to sales 
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling fees are included in sales 
warranty claims and bad debts provisions for the estimated costs for future product warranty claims and bad debts are recorded in cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expense  respectively  at the time a sale is recorded 
the amounts recorded are generally based upon historically derived percentages while also factoring in any new business conditions that might impact the historical analysis such as new product introduction for warranty and bankruptcies of particular customers for bad debts 
the company also periodically evaluates the adequacy of its reserves for warranty and bad debts recorded in its consolidated balance sheet as a further test to ensure the adequacy of the recorded provisions 
warranty claims can extend far into the future and bad debt analysis often involves subjective analysis of a particular customer s ability to pay 
as a result  significant judgment is required by the company in determining the appropriate amounts to record and such judgments may prove to be incorrect in the future 
the company believes that its procedures for estimating such amounts are reasonable and historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subsequent periods when the estimates are adjusted to the actual amounts 
customer returns customer returns are recorded on an actual basis throughout the year and also include an estimate at the end of each reporting period for future customer returns related to sales recorded prior to the end of the period 
the company generally estimates customer returns based upon its historical experience while making adjustments for any changes in business conditions 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
the company records provisions to write down obsolete and excess inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
the process for evaluating obsolete and excess inventory consists of the company analyzing the inventory supply on hand and estimating the net realizable value of the inventory based on historical experience  current business conditions and anticipated future sales 
the company believes that its procedures for estimating such amounts are reasonable and historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subsequent periods when the estimates are adjusted to the actual 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this sfas requires that deferred income taxes be determined based on estimated future tax effects of differences between the tax and book bases of assets and liabilities considering the provisions of enacted tax laws 
the company has historically had prepaid income tax assets due principally to the unfavorable tax consequences of recording expenses for required book reserves for such things as  bad debts  inventory valuation  and warranty that cannot be deducted for income tax purposes until such expenses are actually paid 
the company s deferred tax liabilities consist of favorable tax consequences associated with accelerated depreciation methods for tax purposes 
sfas no 
requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
a review of all available positive and negative evidence must be considered  including the company s performance  the market environment in which the company operates  length of carryforward periods  existing sales backlog and future sales projections 
the company had previously provided valuation allowances only for future tax benefits resulting from certain foreign losses 
in fiscal  as required by sfas no 
 the company established a full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax asset as a result of the uncertainty as to whether these deferred tax assets would more likely than not be realized in the future 
based 
table of contents on the facts and circumstances at that time it was determined that a full valuation allowance was required and it was stated that until an appropriate level of profitability could be sustained no tax benefits would be realized 
as of the first quarter of fiscal  the company believed that an appropriate level of profitability had been established and maintained and that it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized in the future 
the company made this determination based on a review of the facts and circumstances as of may  this review consisted of an analysis of the company s performance  the market environment in which the company currently operates  the length of the carryforward periods  the existing sales backlog and the future sales projections 
long lived asset and goodwill the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset 
goodwill impairment reviews are performed in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
management evaluates the recoverability of goodwill annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances  such as declines in sales  earnings or cash flows  or material adverse changes in the business climate  indicate that the carrying value of an asset might be impaired 
goodwill is considered to be impaired when the net book value of a segment exceeds its estimated fair value 
fair values are established using a discounted cash flow methodology 
the determination of discounted cash flows is based on the long range planning forecast
