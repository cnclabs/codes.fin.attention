item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis relates to our financial condition and results of operations for each of the years ended december    and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading facilities based provider of integrated telecommunication and internet services in major population centers throughout russia and other countries of the commonwealth of independent states cis 
we offer voice  data and internet services to corporations  operators and consumers using our metropolitan overlay network in major cities including moscow  kiev  st 
petersburg  nizhny novgorod  samara  kaliningrad  krasnoyarsk  almaty  and tashkent  and via intercity fiber optic and satellite based networks  including approximately combined access points in russia and other countries of the cis 
in addition  we offer mobile services in kiev and odessa 
we organize our operations into four business segments  as follows business and corporate services bcs 
using our fiber optic and satellite based networks in and between major metropolitan areas of russia  ukraine and other countries of the cis  we provide business and corporate services including voice and data services to corporate clients across all geographical markets and all industry segments  other than telecommunications operators  carrier and operator services 
using our fiber optic and satellite based networks in and between major metropolitan areas of russia  ukraine and other countries of the cis  we provide a range of carrier and operator services including voice and data services to foreign and russian telecommunications and mobile operators  consumer internet services 
using our fiber optic and satellite based networks  we provide dial up internet access to the consumer market and web content offered through a family of internet portals throughout russia  ukraine  kazakhstan  and uzbekistan  and mobile services 
using our mobile networks in kiev and odessa  ukraine  we provide mobile services with value added features  such as voicemail  roaming and messaging services on a subscription and prepaid basis 
we intend  wherever possible  to offer all of our integrated telecommunication services under the golden telecom brand  although  some services still carry local brands because of recent acquisitions 
our dial up internet services are distributed under the rol brand in russia  kazakhstan and uzbekistan and under the svit on line brand in ukraine 
additionally  we hold a minority interest in mct corp 
mct  which in turn has ownership interests in mobile operations located throughout russia and in uzbekistan  tajikistan and afghanistan 
we treat our ownership interest in mct as an equity method investment and are not actively involved in the day to day management of the operations 
most of our revenue is derived from high volume business customers and carriers 
our business customers include large multi national companies  local enterprises  financial institutions  hotels and government agencies 
we believe that the carriers  including mobile operators  which contribute a substantial portion of our revenues  in turn derive a portion of their business from high volume business customers 
thus  we believe that the majority of our ultimate end users are businesses that require access to highly reliable and advanced telecommunications facilities to sustain their operations 
traditionally  we have competed for customers on the basis of network quality  customer service and range of services offered 
in the past several years  other telecommunications operators have also introduced high quality services to the segments of the business market in which we operate 
competition with these operators is intense  and frequently results in declining prices for some of our services  which adversely affect our revenues 
in addition  some of our competitors do not link their prices to the united states dollar usd ruble exchange rate  so when the ruble devalues  their prices effectively become lower in relation to our prices 
the ruble exchange rate with the usd has become relatively stable since early and appreciated in and so price pressures associated with devaluation have eased considerably 
we cannot be certain that the exchange rate will remain stable in the future and therefore we may experience additional price pressures 
recent acquisitions in august  we completed the acquisition of ownership interest in ooo sibchallenge sibchallenge  a telecommunications service provider in krasnoyarsk  russia  for cash consideration of approximately million 
the acquisition 
table of contents of sibchallenge establishes our presence in the krasnoyarsk region 
in addition  sibchallenge has numbering capacity and interconnect agreements 
in december  we completed the acquisition of of the shares in oao comincom comincom  and its wholly owned subsidiary  oao combellga combellga from nye telenor east invest for a total purchase price of approximately million  consisting of approximately million in our common stock and direct transaction costs of approximately million 
the acquisition further strengthens our position in the key moscow and st 
petersburg communications markets  and positions us to realize operating and capital expenditure synergies 
comincom provided telecommunications services  principally to major hotels  business offices  embassies and mobile communication companies through its telecommunications network in russia 
as of december   all assets  liabilities  rights and obligations of comincom and combellga were transferred to sovintel as part of the legal merger of these three wholly owned subsidiaries 
in february  we completed the acquisition of ownership interest in st holding sro st holding  a czech company that owns plus one share in zao samara telecom  a telecommunications service provider in samara  russia from zao smarts and individual owners 
in april  we completed the acquisition of of the common stock in oao balticom mobile balticom that owns of zao westbalt telecom  an alternative telecommunications operator in kaliningrad  russia 
in april  we completed the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in ooo uralrelcom that we did not already own 
in may  we completed the acquisition of a ownership interest in sp buzton buzton  an alternative telecommunications operator in uzbekistan 
these companies were acquired for approximately million in cash  with million held in escrow for a period of one year related to balticom and million payable for buzton upon satisfactory achievement of certain conditions 
in august  we entered into a share purchase agreement with nodama holdings  ltd 
nodama  to acquire of the common stock in hudson telecom  inc  a delaware corporation  which owns ownership interest in ooo digital telephone networks and ooo digital telephone switches  which together comprise one of the largest regional alternative operators in russia 
their operations are in rostov on don and the surrounding region 
upon closure  nodama will receive million in cash of which million will be placed in escrow for a period of one year subject to the achievement of certain financial conditions 
amounts in the escrow may be used to compensate us in the event of the realization of certain contingent liabilities in the acquired entities 
while we expected to consummate this transaction in  it has taken the seller additional time to conclude this transaction 
the consummation of the transaction is conditioned upon  among other things  the completion of satisfactory due diligence and the seller s fulfilment of certain conditions precedent 
the transaction is expected to close in the first half of other developments on january   a new law on telecommunications the new law came into effect in russia 
the new law sets the legal basis for the telecommunications business in russia and defines the status that state bodies have in the telecommunications sector 
the new law was designed to create a new interconnect pricing regime in that should be more transparent and unified  if fairly implemented 
however  as of december   this pricing regime has not been implemented 
the new law also creates a universal service charge calculated as a percentage of revenue which is not expected to exceed of certain revenues of a telecommunications company 
it is expected that the first payments of the universal service charge will be made in the new law may increase the regulation of our operations  as it is intended to regulate licenses for long distance  international long distance and voice over internet protocol voip 
until such time as appropriate regulations consistent with the new law are promulgated  there will be a period of confusion and ambiguity as regulators interpret the legislation 
in march of  we submitted an application for an intercity and international license in russia 
this license would allow us to handle long distance voice traffic for our customers and other licensed operators  including mobile operators 
this license is an integral component to our strategy of becoming the number one nationwide operator in russia 
this intercity and international license regime is an important component to russia s liberalization plans for telecommunications 
in anticipation of approval in  we are planning the implementation of essential infrastructure including a number of long distance switches 
recognizing that many of the markets in which we operate are complex  in particular as it relates to business  regulatory  political and cultural matters  we occasionally seek experienced local partners to assist in markets where we are likely to encounter operational difficulties 
we have been cooperating with local partners in ukraine to resolve commercial and regulatory disputes with monopoly 
table of contents operators and regulatory authorities in ukraine but had not previously finalized the compensation arrangement for the services 
in addition to or in lieu of cash compensation  the board of directors approved the sale of a non controlling interest in golden telecom ukraine gtu to such parties 
upon approval of our board of directors  in august we entered into a compensation arrangement for services provided to assist us in resolving commercial and regulatory disputes with monopoly operators and regulatory authorities in ukraine 
our local partners have provided services on a success fee basis 
our board of directors approved an arrangement that effectively transferred of the shares in gtu owned by us to the local partners as compensation for the services already provided and certain additional services to be provided 
under this arrangement  we paid the local partners million in cash and granted the local partner an option to purchase of gtu for million in cash  in a transaction where the cash and the value of the services were approximately million 
this transaction closed in the third quarter of  when the performance was completed and the option was exercised and resulted in a charge to operating income of approximately million 
the excess of the fair value of consideration exchanged for services over the book value of of net assets of gtu was recorded as a credit to the consolidated equity  rather than income since we did not believe that the method of determining fair value met the objectively determinable criteria as required by staff accounting bulletin topic h 
fair value of the option approximated the fair value of shares transferred to the local partner due to the short exercise period of the option and was determined using the discounted cash flow valuation method 
we continue to believe that ukraine offers promising investment opportunities but that there are still political and commercial risks associated with operating in ukraine 
in july  our board of directors adopted a long term incentive bonus plan ltibp for our senior management  effective as of january  the ltibp is designed to reward senior management with annual bonus awards consisting of restricted shares for our officers and restricted shares and cash payments for other qualified employees participating in ltibp if we meet certain targets for net income growth established by the board of directors 
in addition  the program provides for a one time grant of a limited amount of shares to senior management in an aggregate amount not exceeding  shares 
the ltibp is intended to act as a retention mechanism for senior management as the cash payments and the restricted stock vest over a three year period 
it is expected that the ltibp will act as a substitute for our equity participation plan under which significant amounts of stock options were  in the past  granted to senior management 
during the twelve months ended december  we did not record any expenses associated with the ltibp as we did not achieve the operational and financial targets for we currently anticipate repurchasing from time to time in the open market  a number of our shares equal to the number of our shares that are subject to awards under the ltibp 
we have not granted any shares under the ltibp 
in the third quarter of  management determined that we had been inadvertently carrying accruals for estimated taxes  other than income taxes 
management concluded these accruals for estimated taxes should have been considered unnecessary and reversed prior to january  the net effect of the correction of this non cash error was to reduce current liabilities and non current liabilities by million each with an offsetting decrease to accumulated deficit of million in all periods presented 
this adjustment had no effect on the reported results of operations in any of the periods presented 
in february  we received notice from vimpelcom  our largest customer  that it is diverting a volume of traffic away from us pursuant to the telephone traffic routing provisions of the new law and the general scheme for operation of the russian gsm network promulgated by the russian ministry of communications 
at this point  we are in discussions with vimpelcom and regulatory agencies and cannot accurately predict what will be the impact of this new issue on our operations going forward 
since january   we have lost approximately million in revenue due to vimpelcom s action 
highlights and outlook since early we have witnessed a recovery in the russian market  but downward pricing pressures persist from increased competition and the global trend toward lower telecommunications tariffs 
in and  our traffic volume increases exceeded the reduction in tariffs on certain types of voice traffic 
this is a contributing factor to the increases in our revenue in and  although the major factor of revenue increases in was the acquisition of comincom 
we expect that this trend of year over year increases in traffic volume will continue as long as the russian economy continues to develop at its current pace 
although our revenue growth is strong  our overall margins continue to be impacted by price increases for services received from monopolistic incumbent operations 
in order to handle additional traffic volumes  we have expanded and will continue to expand our fiber optic capacity along our heavy traffic and high cost routes to mitigate declines in traffic margins  reduce our unit transmission costs and ensure sufficient capacity to meet the growing demand for data and internet services 
we expect to continue to add additional transmission capacity  which due to its fixed cost nature can initially depress margins  but will over time allow us to improve or maintain our margins 
we continue to follow our strategy of regional expansion 
the project for the construction of the inter city fiber optic link which we launched in the middle of will be continued into the second half of at present  we are constructing an inter city fiber optic link from moscow to ufa through nizhny novgorod and kazan 
subject to weather conditions  we expect that this inter city fiber optic link will be operational in the second half of to date  this inter city fiber optic link has been completed from moscow to noginsk 
we intend to connect our operations in the european part of russia to this backbone network and plan to invest a total of approximately million to million in this and related backbone projects through in kiev  ukraine we have entered into agreements to obtain sufficient numbering capacity for our business services operations 
our ability to grow our business services operations in kiev may become limited if the parties who provide our numbering capacity and other infrastructure requirements are unable or unwilling to perform under their contracts with us 

table of contents a significant portion of our carrier revenue is generated from the ukrainian cellular operators large volumes of international and long distance traffic 
price and quality of services are the primary factors in their purchase decision 
in  several ukrainian cellular operators  including umc and kyivstar  received international communications license 
nevertheless  ukrainian mobile communications umc  one of our largest customers  continued sending a large volume of outgoing international traffic through our network 
also  cellular operators have an increasing demand for some value added services like our service 
we have seen a significant year over year increase in our dial up internet subscriber numbers and we expect the increase to continue  as our base of regional subscribers expands 
as additional dial up capacity becomes available in moscow  we expect to increase our market share in the capital as well 
we have continued to integrate our acquisitions and improve operational efficiency while at the same time controlling costs 
we expect to incur further costs in connection with overall streamlining of our operations during during the twelve months ended december   we incurred consulting and employee termination costs associated with the operational integration of comincom into our operations which has been recorded in selling  general and administrative expense 
in addition  we have incurred costs associated with  among other things  sarbanes oxley compliance and other consulting and recruiting expenses 
the rapid growth of the telecommunications market in russia  ukraine  and the cis is fueled by macroeconomic growth and the inflow of direct foreign investment 
we anticipate that the economic growth in these markets will create additional demand for telecommunications services 
additionally  in line with worldwide trends  we are starting to observe new customer demands for more sophisticated telecommunications and internet services as well as other new technologies 
we are responding to these customer demands by testing and implementing new technologies such as voip  wireless local loop and high speed consumer internet 
such new technologies will remove some of the barriers to access that some of our customers currently face 
for example  with wireless local loop  we can connect remote customers to our network by by passing the incumbents wire network in order to provide higher quality access 
our customers are willing to pay a premium for this type of technology and customer service 
with respect to  we continue to see growth opportunities organically  through select acquisitions  and through the development of new lines 
while our research indicates the telecommunications sector growth in business segments in the moscow and st 
petersburg markets of fixed telecommunications services will continue to grow  we believe that the bulk of our growth will come from the key regions of rostov on don  nizhny novgorod  samara  ufa  krasnoyarsk  vladivostok  khabarovsk  and ekaterinburg 
we will continue to align the strategy of each of our business segments with market forces in the countries where we operate 
in bcs  our strategy is to focus on and grow our market share through attractive service offerings supported by excellent customer care 
we are focused on expanding into the regions as well as the fast growing small and medium sized enterprise or sme and the small office home office or soho markets 
in these cases where the potential sme and soho customer is not on our network  our ability to fully benefit from growth in these market segments largely depends on the regulatory situation and our ability to get access to the copper and other infrastructure of the incumbent operators under reasonable terms and conditions 
in carrier and operator services our strategy for future years will focus on partnering with more mobile operators in the regions 
we aim to provide mobile operators with the right solutions for their needs and thereby benefit from the mobile operator expansion and growth 
our growth in consumer and internet services indicates that our dial up business continues to be very strong 
however  we also recognize that new technologies are making their way into russia  ukraine  and cis 
thus  we continue to beta test new technologies that will benefit consumers and allow us to strengthen our market position as well as to up sell to our existing dial up customer base 
a recent example of this is our implementation of wimax and wi fi in selected areas of russia 
also  with low penetration of dial up services throughout the regions  we continue to see potential in this market 
critical accounting policies the fundamental objective of financial reporting is to provide useful information that allows a reader to comprehend our business activities 
to assist that understanding  management has identified our critical accounting policies 
these policies have the potential to have a significant impact on our financial statements  either because of the significance of the financial statement item to which they relate  or because they require judgment and estimation due to the uncertainty involved in measuring  at a specific point in time  events which are continuous in nature 
revenue recognition policies  we recognize operating revenues as services are rendered or as products are delivered to customers and installed 
under multiple delivery contracts  involving a combination of product delivery  installation and maintenance  connection and service fees  revenues are recognized based on the relative fair value of the respective amounts 
elements are grouped if they are inseparable or objective evidence of fair value does not exist 
certain revenues  such as connection and installation fees  are deferred 
we also defer direct incremental costs related to connection fees  not exceeding the revenue deferred 
deferred revenues are subsequently recognized over the estimated average customer lives  which are periodically reassessed by us  and such reassessment may impact our future operating results 
in determining the recording of revenue  estimates and assumptions are required in assessing the expected conversion of the revenue streams to cash collected 
allowance for doubtful accounts policies  the allowance estimation process requires management to make assumptions based on historical results  future expectations  the economic and competitive environment  changes in the creditworthiness of our customers  
table of contents and other relevant factors 
changes in the underlying assumptions may have a significant impact on the results of our operations 
in particular  we have certain amounts due to and from subsidiaries of a european telecommunications operator who is currently subject to bankruptcy proceedings 
the ultimate resolution of this matter will be affected by a number of factors including the determination of legal obligations of each party  the course of the bankruptcy proceedings  and the enforceability of any determinations 
we have recognized provisions based on our preliminary estimate of net exposure on the resolution of these receivables and payables 
if our assessment proves to be incorrect we may have to recognize an additional provision of up to million  net of tax  although management believes that the possibility of such an adverse outcome is remote 
long lived asset recovery policies  this policy is in relation to long lived assets  consisting primarily of property and equipment and intangibles  which comprise a significant portion of our total assets 
changes in technology or changes in our intended use of these assets may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change 
we perform periodic internal studies to confirm the appropriateness of estimated economic useful lives for each category of current property and equipment 
additionally  long lived assets  including intangibles  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances have indicated that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
estimates and assumptions used in both setting useful lives and testing for recoverability of our long lived assets require the exercise of management s judgment and estimation based on certain assumptions concerning the expected life of any asset and expected future cash flows from the use of an asset 
goodwill and assessment of impairment  commencing from the adoption of statement on financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january   we perform goodwill impairment testing annually as of october or whenever impairment indicators exist 
this test requires a significant degree of judgment about the future events and it includes determination of the reporting units  allocation of goodwill to the reporting units and comparison of the fair value with the carrying amount of each reporting unit 
based on the discounted cash flow valuations performed in  we concluded that for all reporting units the fair value is in excess of the respective carrying amounts 
valuation allowance for deferred tax asset  we record valuation allowances related to tax effects of deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that the respective tax assets will not be realized 
changes in our assessment of probability of realization of deferred tax assets may impact our effective income tax rate 
business segment information  we changed our reporting for business segments in the second quarter of prior to the completion of the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in sovintel and the subsequent merger of teleross into sovintel in april  we managed our business segments based on telecommunications products that we provided 
in the first quarter of  we re designed our business segments around customer characteristics 
currently  we report four segments within the telecommunications industry business and corporate services  carrier and operator services  consumer internet services and mobile services 
a significant portion of our cost structure  including our investment in infrastructure  benefits multiple segments 
as a result  we perform allocations of certain costs in order to report business segment information for management and financial reporting purposes 
applying different allocation techniques and parameters could impact the reported results of individual business segments 
functional currency  effective january   russia is no longer considered a hyperinflationary economy  therefore the determination of functional currency for united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap reporting purposes should be based on the analysis of the underlying business transactions for each foreign subsidiary 
we have determined in accordance with the functional currency criteria of sfas no 
 foreign currency translation  that the usd should be considered the functional currency of all foreign subsidiaries 
there are subjective elements in this determination  including a weight given to each specific criteria established by sfas no 
changes in the underlying business transactions could lead to different functional currency determination for a particular subsidiary  which would have an impact on its reported financial position and results of operations 
critical accounting estimates accounting estimates are an integral part of the financial statements prepared by management and are based upon management s current judgments 
certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly from management s current judgment 
we believe the following items represent such particularly sensitive accounting estimates allowance for doubtful accounts  any changes in the underlying assumptions of recoverability of accounts receivable by respective aging group or certain specific accounts that are excluded from the specific and general allowances could have a material effect on our current and future results of operations 
we believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover estimated losses in our accounts receivable balances under current conditions 

table of contents tax provisions  in the course of preparing financial statements in accordance with us gaap  we record potential tax loss provisions under the guidelines of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
in general sfas no 
requires loss contingencies to be recorded when they are both probable and reasonably estimable 
in addition  we record other deferred tax provisions under the guidelines of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
significant judgment is required to determine when such provisions should be recorded  and when facts and circumstances change  when such provisions should be released 
useful lives of property and equipment and certain intangible assets  our network assets and amortizable intangible assets are depreciated and amortized over periods generally ranging from five to ten years 
any reduction or increase in the estimated useful lives for a particular category of fixed assets or intangible assets could have a material effect on our future results of operations 
business combinations  sfas no 
 business combinations  requires us to recognize the share in the assets of businesses acquired and respective liabilities assumed based on their fair values 
our estimates of the fair value of the identified intangible assets of businesses acquired are based on our expectations of future results of operations of such businesses 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin no 

fin no 
amended accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  and established standards for determining under what circumstances a variable interest vie should be consolidated with its primary beneficiary 
fin no 
also requires disclosure about vies that are not required to be consolidated but in which the reporting entity has a significant variable interest 
in december  the fasb revised certain implementation provisions of fin no 
the revised interpretation fin no 
r substantially retained the requirements of immediate application of fin no 
to vies created after january  there were no such entities created after january  with respect to older vies  the consolidation requirements under fin no 
r apply not later than for the first financial year or interim period ending after december   if such vie is a special purpose entity spe  and no later than for the first financial year or interim period ending after march   if such a vie is not a spe 
we did not identify any previously formed spes that are vies 
therefore the adoption of fin no 
r did not have an impact on the financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement on financial accounting standard sfas no 
r revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
r supersedes apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
under sfas no 
r  companies must calculate and record the cost of equity instruments  such as stock options or restricted stock  awarded to employees for services received in the income statement  pro forma disclosure is no longer permitted 
the cost of the equity instruments is to be measured based on fair value of the instruments on the date they are granted with certain exceptions and is required to be recognized over the period during which the employees are required to provide services in exchange for the equity instruments 
sfas no 
r is effective in the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  sfas no 
r provides two alternatives for adoption a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted subsequent to the effective date of this statement as well as for the unvested portion of awards outstanding as of the effective date and an modified retrospective method which follows the approach in the modified prospective method  but also permits entities to restate prior periods to reflect compensation cost calculated under sfas no 
for pro forma amounts disclosure 
we plan to adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
as we currently account for share based payments to employees in accordance with the intrinsic value method permitted under abp no 
 no compensation expense is recognized 
the impact of adopting sfas no 
r cannot be accurately estimated at this time  as it will depend on the amount of share based awards granted in future periods 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in a prior period  the impact would approximate the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share 
sfas no 
r also requires that tax benefits received in excess of compensation cost be reclassified from an operating cash flow to a financing cash flow in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
this change in classification will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in the periods after adoption 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets 
sfas no 
addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets 
the guidance in apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions apb no 
 is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the guidance in apb no 
 however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
sfas no 
amends apb no 
to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial 
table of contents substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
this provisions of sfas no 
are effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after june  earlier application is permitted for nonmonetary asset exchanges incurred during fiscal years beginning after the date sfas no 
was issued 
the adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
results of operations the results of our four business segments from the operations of our consolidated entities combined with the non consolidated entities where we are actively involved in the day to day management  are shown in note segment information line of business data to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  revenue and costs from related parties are shown in note related party transactions 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we have determined that the functional currency of each foreign subsidiary is the usd  as the majority of our cash flows are indexed to  or denominated in usd 
through december   russia had been considered to be a highly inflationary environment 
from january   russia ceased to be considered as a highly inflationary economy 
as we believe that the functional currency of each foreign subsidiary is the usd  this change did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
according to russian government estimates  inflation in russia was in  in and in the russian government expects inflation to be approximately in although the rate of inflation has been declining  any return to heavy and sustained inflation could lead to market instability  new financial crises  reduction in consumer buying power and erosion of consumer confidence 
as of april   all assets  liabilities  rights and obligations of teleross were transferred to sovintel as part of the legal merger of these two wholly owned subsidiaries 
this resulted in the reorganization of our operations along the lines of customer characteristics as opposed to the types of telecommunications products we provide 
therefore  in accordance with sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  we have aligned our operating segments in the manner that the chief operating decision maker manages the operations for purposes of making operating decisions and allocating resources 
the discussion of our results of operations is organized as follows consolidated results 
consolidated results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the consolidated results of operations for the year ended december  consolidated financial position 
consolidated financial position at december  compared to consolidated financial position at december  consolidated results 
consolidated results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the consolidated results of operations for the year ended december  consolidated financial position 
consolidated financial position at december  compared to consolidated financial position at december  consolidated results consolidated results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the consolidated results of operations for the year ended december  revenue our revenue increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the overall increase in revenue was due primarily to the consolidation of of comincom s results of operations for a full year and  with respect to our existing business  an increase in customer base and services provided to existing customers  partially offset by lower prices for certain services 
the breakdown of revenue by business group was as follows 
table of contents consolidated revenue consolidated revenue for the year for the year ended december  ended december  in millions revenue business and corporate services carrier and operator services consumer internet services mobile services eliminations total revenue business and corporate services 
revenue from bcs increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase is due to the acquisition of ownership interest in comincom in the fourth quarter of we began consolidating comincom into our results of operations from december  comincom s revenue from bcs was million for the year ended december  bcs revenue increased by approximately million due to the acquisitions of st holding  balticom  and buzton 
we began consolidating these three companies into our results at various points during the first half of additionally  million of the total increase is due to being the first full year that we consolidated the results of sibchallenge  an august acquisition 
the remainder of the increase was the result of expanding our pre existing business 
in addition to the above factors  in our largest market  moscow  we had increases in our domestic traffic revenues due to adding approximately  new corporate customers and signing up new multi tenant business centers and new trade centers in the year ended december  along with actively promoting new services among our client base 
bcs moscow recognized approximately million in revenue from new contracts in and grew the number of its direct inward dialing lines from  as of december  to approximately  as of december  revenue from the bcs division of gtu increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue was due to a increase in the number of serviced voice lines and a increase in average rate per minute of use 
the latter was caused by the calling party pays cpp principle of settlement rates introduced by the ukrainian parliament in late  which has increased revenue and settlement rates to ukrainian mobile networks 
carrier and operator services 
revenue from carrier and operator services increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase is due to the acquisition of ownership interest in comincom in the fourth quarter of we began consolidating comincom into our results of operations from december  comincom s revenue from carrier and operator services was million for the year ended december  also  revenue increased by approximately million due to the acquisitions of st holding  balticom  and buzton 
we began consolidating these three companies into our results at various points during the first half of additionally  million of the total increase is due to being the first full year that we consolidated the results of sibchallenge  an august acquisition 
we have expanded our operations with existing partners and added a number of new carriers specifically in the regions with increased volumes of traffic  including voip 
in addition  we continue to expand our business with major cellular providers both in the capital and in the regions  which helped offset general tariff declines  although pricing pressures still exist 
revenue for the carrier and operator services division of gtu increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue was due to a increase in incoming international traffic which we are able to terminate in a number of cities in ukraine  offset by a decrease in outgoing international traffic 
consumer internet services 
revenue from consumer internet services increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is largely the result of increases in the number of dial up internet subscribers from  at december  to  at december  and the average revenue per internet subscriber increasing from approximately per month to approximately per month over the same period

in case especially large or numerous acquisitions do not materialize  we expect our cash flow from operations to be sufficient to fund our expected requirements  including our capital expenditure requirements 
however  the actual amount and timing of our future cash requirements may differ materially from our current estimates because of changes or fluctuations in our anticipated investments  revenue  operating costs and network expansion plans  timing of acquisitions  and access to alternative sources of financing on favorable terms

in accordance with our policy  we do not enter into any treasury management transactions of a speculative nature 
the ruble and the hryvna are generally non convertible outside russia and ukraine  respectively  so our ability to hedge against further devaluation by converting to other currencies is significantly limited 
further  our ability to convert rubles and hryvna into other currencies in russia and ukraine  respectively  is subject to rules that restrict the purposes for which conversion and the payment of foreign currencies are allowed 
given that much of our operating costs are indexed to or denominated in usd  including employee compensation expense  capital expenditure and interest expense  we have taken specific steps to minimize our exposure to fluctuations in the appropriate foreign currency
