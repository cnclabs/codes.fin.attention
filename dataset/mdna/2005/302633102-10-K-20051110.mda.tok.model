item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information regarding the termination of the metron technology distribution agreements 
industry background the complex process of fabricating semiconductor devices involves several distinct phases that are repeated numerous times 
because each production phase typically requires different processing technologies and equipment  no one semiconductor equipment supplier currently produces all types of tools needed to equip an entire state of the art fabrication facility 
instead  semiconductor device manufacturers typically equip their facilities by combining manufacturing equipment produced by a number of suppliers 
each set of equipment performs specific functions in the manufacturing process 
generally  increasing demand for computer chips  new computer chip designs  new materials of fabrication and new substrate the underlying material upon which a semiconductor device or integrated circuit is formed types both size and composition drives demand for new microelectronics 
table of contents manufacturing equipment and processes 
industries that use microelectronics increasingly demand higher performance devices from manufacturers 
over the last decade  device manufacturers have reduced the feature size and substantially increased the functionality of individual devices through a number of technological advances 
many of these advancements are made possible using the equipment and technologies fsi provides to the semiconductor industry 
our business depends upon the microelectronics manufacturers capital equipment expenditures 
manufacturers expenditures in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for products that use microelectronic devices 
the microelectronics industry has been cyclical in nature and has experienced periodic downturns 
microelectronics manufacturers require equipment suppliers to take an increasingly active role in meeting the manufacturers technology development and capital productivity requirements 
equipment suppliers satisfy this requirement by developing and supporting products and processes required to address the new trends in microelectronics manufacturing 
these trends include development of smaller geometries  transition to new materials  migration to millimeter mm wafers and wafer level packaging 
a number of semiconductor device manufacturers began the transition from to mm diameter wafers in calendar based upon a report published in september by the gartner group  a leading industry market research firm  the percentages of investment in semiconductor process equipment allocated by semiconductor manufacturers to mm capable products were approximately in calendar  in calendar  in calendar and in calendar semiconductor manufacturers investment in mm capable products is forecasted to be approximately of their total equipment spending in calendar and of their total equipment spending in calendar the semiconductor equipment market has experienced a decline from calendar through according to the gartner group  purchases of semiconductor equipment by microelectronics manufacturers decreased from billion in calendar to billion in calendar based upon the most recent gartner group forecast  the semiconductor equipment industry is expected to further decline in calendar products the mix of products we sell has varied significantly from year to year 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the amount of revenues and approximate percentages of our total revenues by our principal product lines fiscal year ended august  august  august  dollars in thousands surface conditioning products polaris systems and services products spare parts and service surface conditioning products our surface conditioning products perform etching and cleaning operations for front end of line feol fabrication steps  where integrated circuits or transistors are formed in and on the substrate during the manufacturing process  back end of line beol fabrication steps  where metal wiring levels are formed on the surface of the wafer and are connected to the transistors  and 
table of contents wafer level packaging surface preparation  including cleaning  etching and stripping functions necessary to fabricate solder bumps or other terminal structures needed to connect the chip to the circuit board 
in today s most advanced integrated circuit ic manufacturing  there are over surface preparation steps 
many factors are considered when designing and optimizing a surface preparation process to meet a particular application need 
these factors can include cleaning and etching goals  which are related to the removal of wafer contaminates and films  selectivity goals  which are related to leaving desired films and structures intact  and manufacturing goals  which are related to cost  productivity  safety and environmental concerns 
the priority of each factor in determining the final surface preparation process can vary widely across the approximately different steps and depends on the contaminants that need to be removed  the materials that need to be preserved on the wafer surface  the dimensions of patterned features and overall process integration 
this wide variety of requirements and priorities indicates there is no one surface preparation technology that can provide the optimal process for each surface preparation requirement 
this is why fsi offers a range of technologies that allow us  with our customers  to select and optimize the best solution for each step 
these technologies include batch spray  batch immersion and single wafer cryogenic aerosol 
spray processing systems 
our spray processing systems  which include the mercury and zeta spray cleaning systems  are sophisticated surface conditioning systems that remove unwanted films and contaminations from the surface of semiconductor wafers at various stages in the microelectronic device fabrication process 
multiple cassettes that contain up to wafers each are placed onto a turntable inside the system s process chamber 
as the turntable rotates  dispense ports apply a chemical spray to the wafers surfaces to dissolve and remove the undesirable films and contaminants 
after chemical application  deionized water ultrapure water that has been treated and is used to remove all possible contaminants from the surface of a silicon wafer such as ions  bacteria  silica  particles and dissolved metals is sprayed on the wafer surfaces to rinse away the chemicals 
multiple chemical and rinse steps may be employed depending on the customer s specific application 
the process sequence is completed with a dry step a flow of nitrogen into the chamber dries the wafers and the chamber 
our sophisticated control system and chemical mixing manifold allows the user to define  control and monitor a variety of chemical mixtures  temperatures and sequences 
this enables the user to rapidly develop new processes and utilize the systems for multiple applications 
our batch spray systems achieve state of the art performance and are well suited for applications that require removal of high levels of contamination 
through efficient use of chemicals and water along with small footprints  customers realize operational costs that can be lower than competing systems 
the mercury system is a semi automated batch spray processor designed for wafer sizes up to mm in diameter and process technologies through the nanometers nm node 
the system offers the benefits of low capital cost and low cost of ownership in a small footprint 
the mercury system ranges in price from  to  depending on features 
the fully automated zeta system  a batch spray processor  is currently available in configurations for both and mm wafers 
the advanced process controls  process capability and automation are ideal for leading technology nodes  particularly nm and below 
our zeta products provide a reliable  automated environment to move wafers to and from the process chamber 
this tool s eight chemical flow system allows for a wide range of chemical blend ratios 
the system is also available in a semi automated configuration capable of processing mm or mm wafers 
our zeta systems range in price from  to  subsequent generations of the zeta system  have increased capabilities with the addition of new tool packages and processes 
the flashclean tm advantage package  consisting of hardware  software and process advancements  enhances system productivity and performance by shortening process time and 
table of contents increasing throughput 
the platnistrip tm process for nickel platinum films is designed to help our customers implement salicide formation at the nm technology node 
the ecoblend tm dilute acid process is a cost effective and environmentally friendly method to remove post ash residues for aluminum and tungsten interconnect applications 
to address our customers desire for more environmentally benign processes  we supply an ozonated water generation module for use with our magellan  zeta and mercury systems 
the use of ozone a form of oxygen having three atoms to the molecule in semiconductor processing is attractive because it uses only oxygen and water in the place of sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide mixtures and lowers costs by reducing chemical consumption  water usage and waste treatment 
cryokinetic processing systems 
our antares cryokinetic an energy transfer process used to remove non chemically bonded particles from the surface of a microelectronic device cleaning system is a fully automated  single wafer cleaning platform designed for and mm wafers 
these systems offer a field proven history of removing surface particle defects and improving customer yields 
the antares system cleans using an all dry non chemically reactive method of removing defects from all surface types from the beginning to the end of the device manufacturing process 
of particular benefit to our customers is its inherent compatibility with new device materials and increasingly smaller device features 
cryokinetic clean technology allows our customers to insert particle removal steps in the manufacturing line where previous or traditional wet cleaning and scrubber methods have been phased out due to their incompatibility with new materials and were found to cause watermark residue and surface charge defects 
implementing the cryokinetic clean allows our customers to recover yield that would normally be lost by traditional approaches 
the antares system is also available with the aspectclean tm process 
the aspectclean process is a method of removing particle defects from front end of line feol and back end of line beol patterned structures without altering film properties or physically damaging the structures  which is becoming more critical in nm development programs and nm production ramps 
traditional methods of defect reduction have been phased out due to damage issues  where as this process is demonstrating high removal efficiency on sensitive narrow structures without causing damage 
we believe the technical capabilities of the antares system are extendable well beyond current technology nodes and will result in increased customer acceptance due to the limitations of aforementioned scrubbing methods 
antares systems range in price from  to  vapor processing systems 
we are discontinuing the excalibur product line at the end of calendar year changing market needs created a situation where the specialized use of the excalibur system was no longer required 
fsi will retain the extensive portfolio of intellectual property patents as it relates to this technology 
immersion processing systems 
immersion cleaning systems are used to clean silicon wafers by immersing wafers in multiple tanks filled with process chemicals 
these systems enable the implementation of high performance isopropyl alcohol ipa assisted drying to meet the critical cleaning requirements for   and nm technology nodes 
our magellan immersion cleaning system is a fully automated immersion cleaning system designed for either or mm wafers at advanced technology nodes and is capable of multiple mainstream cleans  including critical clean  resist strip and etch 
it is differentiated from the competition through its process performance  flexibility  extendibility  and rapid cycle time in a footprint that is up to smaller than the leading competition when configured for specific applications 
the tool incorporates a portfolio of exclusive intellectual property  including our surface tension gradient stg rinse dry technology  symflow tm etch technology  ozone oxide re growth technology  and narrow gate compatible megalens tm acoustic diffuser megasonic cleaning technology 
the magellan system is qualified for several processes including feol critical clean  feol photoresist strip an etch resistant material used for transferring an image to the surface of a silicon wafer and post ash clean  oxide etch and nitride etch 

table of contents in  we expanded the magellan s maximum process module configuration from five to seven  thereby enabling optimal configurations for integrated cleaning and multi function cleaning opportunities 
in addition  we made numerous product enhancements to enable tool transition from research and development to high volume manufacturing 
the magellan system ranges in price from  to  yieldup rinse dry and immersion systems 
an end of life plan for our yieldup systems has been initiated 
see item legal proceedings for additional information on our ability to sell yieldup modules 
all yieldup rinsing and drying modules will be shipped by february  the last shipments of yieldup and stand alone systems will be june and july   respectively 
yieldup modules and systems range in price from  to  pss products our pss products are microlithography products used to deposit photoresist  which is light sensitive  etch resistant material used to transfer an image to the surface of a silicon wafer and develop the photosensitive material 
following our announcement on march  to exit the resist process equipment market  we discontinued our active manufacture and sale of these products and established the pss business to provide key support services to our global polaris customer base

this allows customers to add capacity for a lower capital investment 
the ratio of new to pre owned modules is based on customer expectations and the availability of used modules 
these systems are able to accommodate a variety of processes and can be purchased in a new configuration  or a system can be reconfigured and upgraded to match installed configurations 
spare parts and service we offer system upgrade packages  spare part kits  software maintenance licenses  individual spare part components and support services that provide product and process enhancements to extend the life of previously purchased and installed surface conditioning and microlithography equipment 
our customer service and process engineers assist and train customers worldwide to perform preventive maintenance on and to service our equipment 
in addition  our process engineering groups develop process applications to expand the capabilities of our equipment 
these upgrade and spare part packages and support service programs enable our worldwide customers to realize a higher return on their capital investment 
we sell a variety of process  service and maintenance programs 
a number of customers have purchased maintenance contracts in which our service employees work at the customer s facility to provide process service and maintenance support for our equipment 
backlog and seasonality our backlog consists of orders with delivery dates within the next months for which a customer s purchase order has been received 
our backlog at fiscal year end was million  at fiscal year end was million and at fiscal year end was million 
approximately of our backlog at fiscal year end and of our backlog at fiscal year end was comprised of orders from two customers for each year 
seagate technology and texas instruments were the top two customers in backlog at the end of fiscal samsung and intel were the top two customers in backlog at the end of fiscal the loss of any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

table of contents all orders are subject to cancellation by the customer and in some cases a penalty provision could apply to a cancellation 
in fiscal  purchase orders aggregating approximately million  constituting of sales  were canceled and not rescheduled 
in fiscal  purchase orders aggregating approximately million  constituting of sales  were canceled and not rescheduled 
because of the timing and relative size of certain orders received by us and possible changes in delivery schedules and order cancellations  our backlog can vary from time to time so that backlog as of any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any subsequent period 
our business is not seasonal to any significant extent 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional sales and backlog information 
research and development we believe that our future success depends in large part on our ability to enhance and advance  in collaboration with our customers and other equipment and materials manufacturers  our existing sc product lines to meet the changing needs of microelectronics manufacturers 
we believe that industry trends  such as the use of smaller circuit geometries  increased use of larger substrates and manufacturers increased desire for integrated processing equipment  will make highly automated and integrated systems  including single substrate processing systems  more important to customers 
for assistance in our development efforts  we maintain relationships with our customers and others  who help identify and analyze industry trends and our development activities to meet the industry s advanced technology needs 
our current research and development programs are focused on creating new processes and technologies for cleaning substrates without damaging ever smaller patterned features being used for the most advanced ic devices 
we are also conducting programs to increase process control and flexibility through monitoring and software management systems and process automation  robotics automation in the cleanroom  and integration of our product offerings with other suppliers products 
each of these programs involves collaboration with customers and other equipment manufacturers to ensure proper machine configuration and process development to meet industry requirements 
we maintain an  square foot  state of the art demonstration and process development laboratory for our surface conditioning business in our chaska  minnesota facility 
in addition  our japanese affiliate  m fsi  ltd  maintains a demonstration laboratory in its okayama  japan facility 
expenditures for research and development  which are expensed as incurred  during fiscal were approximately million  representing of total sales 
expenditures for research and development during fiscal were approximately million  representing of total sales  and expenditures for research and development during fiscal were approximately million  representing of total sales 
the fiscal to fiscal decline relates primarily to our decision to exit the resist processing market in march we expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development 
we also recognize the importance of managing product transitions successfully  as the introduction of new products could adversely affect sales of existing products 
marketing  sales and support we market our products worldwide to manufacturers of microelectronic devices 
our marketing and sales efforts are focused on building long term collaborative relationships with our customers 
these efforts are supported by marketing  sales  and service personnel  along with applications engineers 
these worldwide fsi teams work collaboratively with individual ic manufacturers  in fsi process laboratories and at customer sites  to transfer fsi developed product and process innovations  integrate them into customer process flows and optimize them according to customer priorities 
on october   we announced the early termination of our distribution agreements with metron technology  effective march  this change occurred as a result of our customers asking us to 
table of contents strengthen our presence in these regions and to bring them the full capabilities of our organization 
we worked closely with metron technology to ensure a successful transition of sales  applications  service and spares logistical functions 
as of the end of fiscal  our sales effort was supported by approximately employees and contractors engaged in customer service and support 
during fiscal  our products were directly sold and serviced by us in north america  europe and the asia pacific region  and through our joint venture  m fsi  ltd  in japan 
we believe as a result of our direct selling and service initiative  we are experiencing broader product adoption in europe and the asia pacific regions 
by providing a full portfolio of direct support services  we have developed stronger customer relationships and our customers are beginning to show greater interest in expanding beyond their use of fsi traditional spray cleaning technologies to include new beol and wafer bumping applications for spray  as well as employing our advanced immersion and cryokinetic technologies 
our increased responsiveness on the local level has resulted in more productive collaborative efforts and joint development programs with ic makers throughout the world for nm production and and nm development projects 
international sales  in europe and asia accounted for approximately of total sales in fiscal  of total sales in fiscal  and of total sales in fiscal on august   metron technology entered into a stock and asset purchase agreement purchase agreement with applied materials  inc applied 
on december   applied  pursuant to the purchase agreement  acquired the worldwide operating subsidiaries and business of metron technology 
applied paid approximately  in cash to metron technology upon closing on december  in connection with the consummation of the asset sale to applied  metron technology changed its name to nortem nv nortem and began a liquidation process 
nortem was delisted from the nasdaq on april  and began trading over the counter 
shareholders of nortem received two liquidating distributions 
the initial distribution was made on march  at per share 
we received million and recorded a gain of million in the third quarter of fiscal in june  we received the final distribution from nortem  net of certain dutch withholding taxes 
a portion of the final distribution was deemed a dividend  and that portion was subject to withholding tax 
the net distribution was approximately per share 
we received million and recorded a gain of approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to this final distribution 
we also recorded a receivable for approximately million for a refund of a portion of the dutch withholding taxes 
we own a equity interest in m fsi  ltd  a japanese joint venture company formed in with mbk project holdings ltd 
formerly mitsui co  ltd 
and its wholly owned subsidiary  chlorine engineers corp  ltd 
collectively  mitsui 
mitsui owns a equity interest in m fsi 
in connection with its formation  we and mitsui granted m fsi certain product and technology licenses and product distribution rights pursuant to a license agreement and a distribution agreement 
m fsi also distributes products of other manufacturers and its own internally developed products 
in september  m fsi granted fsi exclusive rights to distribute certain of m fsi s products outside of japan and an exclusive license covering the patents and related technology with regard to certain products for use outside of japan 
in fiscal year  the majority of our international sales were made to metron technology or m fsi for resale to end users of our products 
in addition to metron technology prior to the termination of our distribution agreements and m fsi having a direct presence in europe and asia  we augmented their support to customers with sales and service personnel located in the regions 
in some cases  we also sold directly to an international customer  in which case we paid a commission to our affiliated distributor in connection with the sale 
when commissions are taken into account  the international sales to our affiliates are on terms generally no less favorable to us than international sales by us directly to non affiliates 

table of contents manufacturing  raw materials and suppliers we maintain manufacturing facilities in chaska  minnesota and allen  texas 
we typically assemble our products and systems from components and prefabricated parts manufactured and supplied by others  such as process controllers  robots  integrated circuits  power supplies  stainless steel pressure vessels  chamber bowls  valves and relays 
certain of the items manufactured by others are made to our specifications 
typically  final assembly and systems tests are performed by our manufacturing personnel 
quality control is maintained through quality assurance programs with suppliers  incoming inspection of components  in process inspection during equipment assembly  and final inspection and operation of manufactured equipment prior to shipment 
we have a company wide quality program in place and received iso certification in and iso certification in certain of the components and subassemblies included in our products are obtained from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers to ensure overall quality and delivery timeliness 
although we seek to reduce dependence on sole and limited source suppliers  disruption or termination of certain of these sources could have a temporary adverse effect on our operations 
we believe that alternative sources could be obtained and qualified to supply these products  if necessary  but that production delays would likely occur in some cases 
further  a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could have an adverse effect on our operating results  delay scheduled deliveries and result in damage to customer relationships 
competition the semiconductor equipment industry is very competitive and marked by ever advancing technology challenges 
significant competitive factors in the equipment market include system price  which encompasses total cost of ownership  quality  process performance  reliability  flexibility  extendibility  integration with other products  process or tool of record  and customer support 
many of our established competitors have greater financial  engineering  research  development  manufacturing  marketing  service and support resources 
to remain competitive  we must invest in research and development  marketing  customer service and support programs  and must manage our operating expenses 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or that our products will continue to be viewed as competitive as a result of technological advances by existing or new competitors or due to changes in semiconductor technology 
our surface conditioning products compete with  among others  dainippon screen manufacturing co 
ltd  kaijo denki  ses co  ltd  semitool  inc  the sez group  akrion and tokyo electron ltd 
our pss organization competes with various small equipment refurbishment  equipment maintenance and spare parts providers 
customers we sell products from one or more of our product lines to most major microelectronics manufacturers 
we have an extensive history of sales to several of the largest integrated circuit manufacturers and we have over active customers worldwide 
texas instruments accounted for approximately of our total sales in fiscal  of our total sales in fiscal and of our total sales in fiscal samsung electronics accounted for approximately of our total sales in fiscal and less than of our total sales in both fiscal and fiscal ibm accounted for less than of our total sales in fiscal and fiscal and approximately of our total sales in fiscal the loss of any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  fluctuations in our customer mix 
the timing of an order for our equipment is primarily dependent upon the customer s expansion program  replacement needs  or requirements to improve productivity and yields 
consequently  a customer who places significant orders in one year will not necessarily place significant orders in subsequent years 

table of contents sales to m fsi ltd  our international distributor  accounted for approximately of our total sales in fiscal sales to m fsi ltd and metron technology  our international distributors  accounted for approximately of our total sales in fiscal  and of our total sales in fiscal usually these systems are purchased for resale to device manufacturers

patents  trademarks and intellectual property our success depends upon a variety of factors  including proprietary technology 
it is important to protect our technology by obtaining and enforcing patents 
consequently  we have an active program to file patent applications in the united states and other countries on inventions we consider significant 
we also possess other proprietary intellectual property  including trademarks  know how  trade secrets and copyrights 
we also protect our proprietary information through confidentiality agreements with our employees and with third parties 
we have a number of patents in the united states and other countries  and additional applications are pending 
these patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or may not provide any competitive advantages to us 
pending applications may not result in patents and the claims allowed in future patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
the laws of some foreign countries may not permit the protection of our proprietary rights to the same extent as under the laws of the united states 
although we believe that protection afforded by our patents  patent applications  and other intellectual property rights has value  because of rapidly changing technology  our future success is dependent on our employees skill sets 
in the normal course of business  we from time to time receive and make inquiries about possible patent infringement 
in dealing with such inquiries  it may be necessary or useful for us to obtain or grant licenses or other rights 
however  there can be no assurance that such license rights will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
the inability to obtain certain license or other rights  or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms  or the need to engage in litigation could have a material adverse effect on us

table of contents employees as of august   we had approximately full and part time employees 
competition for highly skilled employees is intense 
we believe that a great part of our future success depends upon our continued ability to retain and attract qualified employees 
we are not subject to any collective bargaining agreement and have never been subject to a work stoppage 
we believe we have good relations with our employees 
environmental matters in january  we received our certificate of registration from bsi  inc for its iso environmental management system 
iso is an internationally recognized environmental management standard that empowers organizations to address the environmental impact of activities  services and processes 
the standard then provides a framework for enterprises to take steps to identify issues significant to them and implement environmental management programs to achieve improved performance 
registration with iso allows companies to reaffirm that environmental processes are essential components of their business strategy 
we have a long history of environmentally friendly practices and research and development programs that actively seek out ways to operate more environmentally efficient 
we registered with iso to emphasize our ongoing commitment to the preservation and protection of the environment  and to support existing environmental health and safety initiatives 
we implemented an enterprise wide program to actively engage our employees and to emphasize the importance of protecting the environment in everyday life at fsi 
our programs include recycling  water use reductions  chemical handling processes and equipment design for the environment 
we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in the manufacturing and product development process 
we believe we are in compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business 
these permits generally relate to the disposal of hazardous wastes 
if we fail to comply with present or future regulations  fines could be imposed  production and product development could be suspended  or operations could cease 
such regulations could require us to acquire significant equipment or take other actions to comply with environmental regulations at a potentially significant cost to us 
if we fail to control the use of  or adequately restrict the discharge or disposal of  hazardous substances  we could incur future liabilities 
see also item legal proceedings for a discussion of our environmental legal proceedings

the facility contains our surface conditioning business and other administrative and support functions 
it includes research  laboratory and engineering facilities   square feet of class  and  cleanroom space  manufacturing support operations and a customer training center 
in february  we sold our  square foot allen  texas facility 
concurrent with the sale  we entered into a sublease of approximately  square feet of space in the facility 
the lease ends on august   however  we have an option to extend the sublease term for one additional period of months  by giving not less than days prior written notice 
we also maintain small leased sales and service offices throughout europe and asia near our customer locations 
management believes its existing facilities are well maintained and in good operating condition 
item legal proceedings we generate minor amounts of liquid and solid hazardous waste and use licensed haulers and disposal facilities to ship and dispose of such waste 
in the past  we have received notice from state or federal enforcement agencies that we are a potentially responsible party prp in connection with the investigation of several hazardous waste disposal sites owned and operated by third parties 
in each matter  we have elected to participate in settlement offers made to all de minimis parties with respect to such sites 
the risk of being named a prp is that if any of the other prp s are unable to contribute its proportionate share of the liability  if any  associated with the site  those prp s that are financially able could be held financially responsible for the shortfall 
there has and continues to be substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the microelectronics industry 
commercialization of new products or further commercialization of our current products could provoke claims of infringement by third parties 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us  to protect trade secrets or know how owned by us or to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights 
any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of effort by us  which by itself could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 
further  adverse determinations in such litigation could result in our loss of proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require us to seek licenses from third parties or prevent us from manufacturing or selling one or more products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
certain of our product lines are intended for use with hazardous chemicals 
as a result  we are notified by our customers from time to time of incidents involving our equipment that have resulted in a spill or release of a hazardous chemical 
we maintain product liability insurance in an effort to minimize our risk 
however  in some cases it may be alleged that we or our equipment are at fault 
there can be no assurance that any future litigation resulting from such claims would not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results 
hsu litigation in fall  pursuant to the employee stock purchase and shareholder agreement dated november  between eric c 
hsu and semiconductor systems  inc ssi the shareholder agreement and in connection with mr 
hsu s termination of his employment with ssi in august  the former shareholders of ssi purchased the shares of ssi common stock then held by mr 
hsu 
in 
table of contents april  we acquired ssi  and ssi became our wholly owned subsidiary 
in october  eric c 
and angie l 
hsu the plaintiffs filed a lawsuit in the superior court of california  county of alameda  southern division  against ssi and the former shareholders of ssi 
the plaintiffs alleged that such purchase breached the shareholder agreement and violated the california corporations code  breached the fiduciary duty owed plaintiffs by the individual defendants and constituted fraud 
in september and october  certain of mr 
hsu s claims were tried to a jury in alameda county superior court in oakland  california 
at the conclusion of the trial  the jury found that ssi breached the shareholder agreement between it and mr 
hsu and that the damages that resulted were approximately million 
in addition  each of the individual defendant shareholders was found liable for conversion  and damages of million were awarded 
certain individual defendants were also found to have intentionally interfered with mr 
hsu s prospective economic advantage and damages of million were awarded 
finally  several individual defendants and ssi were found to have violated certain provisions of the california corporation code and damages of million were awarded 
in proceedings subsequent to the trial  the court determined that the plaintiffs were entitled to an award against ssi of prejudgment interest on the breach of contract damages approximately million at percent per annum from october in addition  the court awarded plaintiffs approximately  in costs and approximately million in attorneys fees against ssi and the individual defendants 
on november   the court signed its final judgment reflecting the jury s awards  interest  attorneys fees and costs assessed against each of the defendants 
following the entry of judgment  ssi and the other defendants filed post trial motions seeking reduction in the jury s damage awards and or a new trial 
the court denied these post trial motions and there was no reduction in damages against ssi 
mr 
hsu was awarded an additional  for attorneys fees and expenses incurred since the judgment was rendered in november subsequently  ssi and the individual defendants filed an appeal on a variety of grounds  and we posted an appeal bond on behalf of ssi and defendants in the amount of million 
as part of the posting of the bond  we entered into a letter of credit in the amount of million with a surety company 
this letter of credit was collateralized with restricted cash of the same amount 
the appellate court upheld the original judgment 
the total judgment against ssi together with post judgment interest and attorneys fees as of february  aggregated approximately million 
as a result  we recorded a million charge in the second quarter of fiscal we had previously recorded million of charges to operations associated with this litigation 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we retired the  shares of our common stock held in the escrow created at the time of our acquisition of ssi to cover such claims 
as the ssi merger was a pooling of interests  we decreased our stockholder s equity by an amount equal to million 
on march   we tendered funds totaling approximately million to the hsus via a cashier s check which we believe was the full judgment amount plus all applicable interest 
this included million of cash provided by the individual defendants 
subsequently  instead of depositing the cashier s check  the hsus filed a motion with the court to enforce the judgment against the appeal bond and we and the individual defendants filed a motion to release the bond 
the hsus cashed the cashiers check in july in august  the court ruled in our favor and an acknowledgement of full satisfaction of the judgment was filed with the courts by the hsus attorneys 
the bond was released in august yieldup patent litigation in september  cfm technologies  inc and cfmt  inc

table of contents products division 
with the merger completed  mattson assumed responsibility for the two suits cfm filed against yieldup 
on march   scp global technologies scp acquired the wet product division of mattson  including cfm and assumed responsibility for the two lawsuits 
on february   fsi and scp announced that they settled the two patent infringement lawsuits pending in the united states district court for the district of delaware 
in an effort to settle these lawsuits  we acknowledged the validity and enforceability of the patents  but disputed that any of our products infringed upon the claims of the patents 
we agreed to pay scp million for a release from past infringement claims and a prospective license under all four patents asserted against us in the two lawsuits 
the release applies to all purchasers of our products containing its surface tension gradient stg technology 
the prospective license applies to all end user customers of our products  subject to certain limitations 
in addition  we agreed to supply scp customers  at a pre established price  our rinse dry kits to implement stg technology for certain applications

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations application of critical accounting policies and estimates in accordance with securities and exchange commission guidance  those material accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition and require complex management judgment are discussed below 
our critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows revenue recognition  valuation of long lived and intangible assets  and estimation of valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  specifically product warranty  inventory reserves and allowance for doubtful accounts 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the purchase price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
if our equipment sales involve sales to our existing customers who have previously accepted the same type s of equipment with the same type s of specifications  we account for the product sales as a multiple element arrangement 
we recognize the equipment revenue upon shipment and transfer of title 

table of contents the other multiple elements also include installation  extended warranty contracts and training 
equipment installation revenue is valued based on estimated service person hours to complete installation and published or quoted service labor rates and is recognized when the installation has been completed 
training revenue is valued based on published training class prices or quoted rates and is recognized when the customers complete the training classes or when a customer specific training period has expired 
the published or quoted service labor rates and training class prices are rates actually charged and billed to our customers 
all other product sales with customer specific acceptance provisions are recognized upon customer acceptance 
future revenues may be negatively impacted if we are unable to meet customer specific acceptance criteria 
revenue related to spare part sales is recognized upon shipment 
revenues related to maintenance and service contracts and extended warranty contracts are recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts 
timing and amount of revenue recognized is dependent on the mix of revenue recognized upon shipment versus acceptance 
for revenue recognized upon acceptance  it is dependent upon when customer specific criteria are met 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model or another valuation technique 
net intangible assets and long lived assets amounted to million as of august  our investment in our affiliate  metron technology  was accounted for by the equity method of accounting until the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal while we determined at august  that our investment in metron technology was not other than temporarily impaired  our decision on october  to use metron technology shares with a value of to settle the termination fee payment with metron technology triggered an impairment loss on that date for all of the shares we held 
accordingly  the difference between the per share carrying value and the per share value agreed upon for purposes of the transition agreement on the shares held was recorded as a non cash impairment charge of million in our quarter ended november  the per share value reflected the average closing price of the common stock of metron technology for the five business days prior to the execution of the transition agreement 
upon completion of the termination of the distribution agreements with metron technology  our ownership in metron technology was reduced from approximately to approximately 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the early termination of our distribution agreements with metron technology 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began to account for our investment in metron technology as a marketable equity security available for sale and carried the investment at fair market per the closing price of metron technology s stock as reported on the nasdaq national market 
during fiscal  metron technology was acquired by applied materials  inc and was liquidated 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of the liquidation 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we conducted a review of the long lived assets of our microlithography business  as we transitioned to the pss business model 
accordingly  we recorded a write down of million against the property  plant and equipment assets of the pss business to write the assets down to their estimated fair value 
this write down included a million impairment charge associated with the pss facility and a million impairment charge related to the pss business equipment 
these impairment charges were based upon our review of the pss facility and business 
table of contents equipment and their estimated fair values 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of impairment charges 
product warranty estimation we record a liability for warranty claims at the time of sale 
the amount of the liability is based on the trend in the historical ratio of claims to sales  releases of new products and other factors 
the warranty periods for new equipment manufactured by us range from one to two years 
special warranty reserves are also accrued for major rework campaigns 
although management believes the likelihood to be relatively low  claims experience could be materially different from actual results because of the introduction of new  more complex products  competition or other external forces  manufacturing changes that could impact product quality  or as yet unrecognized defects in products sold 
inventory reserves estimation we record reserves for inventory shrinkage and for potentially excess  obsolete and slow moving inventory 
the amounts of these reserves are based upon historical loss trends  inventory levels  physical inventory and cycle count adjustments  expected product lives  forecasted sales demand and recoverability 
results could be materially different if demand for our products decreased because of economic or competitive conditions  length of the industry downturn  or if products become obsolete because of technical advancements in the industry or by us 
allowance for doubtful accounts estimation management must make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable 
the most significant risk is the risk of sudden unexpected deterioration in financial condition of a significant customer who is not considered in the allowance 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
results could be materially impacted if the financial condition of a significant customer deteriorated and related accounts receivable are deemed uncollectible 
accounts receivable are charged off after management determines that they are uncollectible 
industry update semiconductor industry conditions were weak during the first half of fiscal  as our customers managed through the inventory build up that occurred during the summer of as a result  their factory utilization rates dropped below percent during the second half of our fiscal year 
however  recently  semiconductor manufacturers factory utilization rates have improved and are now running well above percent  near their capacity limits for certain devices 
industry analysts are forecasting that demand for semiconductors will increase percent to billion in calendar from billion in the prior year 
the increase is being driven by memory  micro component and assp application specific standard product device demand 
semiconductor demand is forecasted to grow percent to billion in calendar according to industry analysts  total equipment spending by semiconductor manufacturers in calendar is expected to decrease nearly percent to billion as compared to approximately billion in calendar analysts are now forecasting equipment spending to increase modestly to billion in calendar and return to double digit growth in calendar when compared to prior cycles  device manufacturers are managing capacity increases carefully and acting quickly to slow down new equipment purchases in response to slow downs in production rates 
we expect this trend to continue 
our order pipeline remains strong as we continue to monitor an extensive list of order opportunities 
we now have one or more of our flagship products placed at nearly all of the top ten semiconductor manufacturers ranked by capital spending 
we are starting to see the benefit from some of these insertions 

table of contents assuming we execute well on existing and new evaluation opportunities  we believe we are in an excellent position to participate to the extent that these leading device manufacturers add capacity in fiscal results of operations for the fiscal year ended august   we had net losses of  as compared to net income of  for the fiscal year ended august  the decline in financial performance related primarily to a decrease in domestic sales revenue 
for the fiscal year ended august   we had net income of  as compared to a net loss of  for the fiscal year ended august  the improved financial performance was a result of increased sales revenue from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due primarily to improved industry conditions 
we also improved our gross margins to for fiscal and reduced operating expenses by approximately million as compared to fiscal wind down of microlithography business in march  we announced that we would wind down the microlithography business due to uncertain economic conditions and the weak semiconductor industry forecast 
the decision was also due to a history of operating losses of the microlithography business as a result of competitive pressures and general economic and industry conditions 
subsequent to the wind down  we provide support services for our polaris products through our pss business 
we recorded million of inventory charges in the second quarter of fiscal based on the estimated future sales and recoverability  specifically related to our decision to wind down the microlithography business 
we determined the million inventory charge based on the inventory balance as of march  as compared to the inventory balance expected to be used for pss orders in backlog  anticipated orders and anticipated order cancellations and adjusted the net inventory balance to its net realizable value 
during fiscal  we had sales of pss product inventory with an original cost of approximately million that had previously been written down to zero 
during fiscal  we had sales of pss product inventory with an original cost of approximately million that had previously been written down to zero and during fiscal  we had sales of pss product inventory with an original cost of approximately million that had previously been written down to zero 
in addition  we were able to reduce certain open purchase order commitments and inventory buyback requirements 
since we recorded the pss product inventory reserves as a result of the wind down of our microlithography business in the second quarter of fiscal  we have had sales of pss product inventory that had previously been written down to zero and reductions in inventory buyback requirements of million and have disposed of million of pss product inventory 
the original cost of pss product inventory available for sale or to be disposed of as of august  was million 
we will continue to try to sell the impaired inventory to our customers as spares  refurbished systems and upgrades to existing systems 
if unsuccessful  some of the items will be disposed of 
only as items are sold or disposed of will the reserve be reversed or reduced 
gross margins will be higher if inventory carried at a reduced cost is sold 
the impact of such sales on our margins will fluctuate depending on the amount and timing of product sales  specific customers and specific inventory sold 
we also recorded a write down of million against the property  plant and equipment assets of the pss business 
this write down included a million impairment charge for the microlithography business facility 
this impairment charge was based upon our estimate of fair value of the facility 
as part of our analysis  management had a competitive market overview performed and reviewed office buildings currently on the market and available for lease or sale 
in estimating the fair value of the facility  we assumed the building would be marketed as office space and that the special purpose space  such as the clean rooms and laboratories  would be converted to office space 
this assumption was made based upon the low demand in the area for clean room facilities and with consideration for the electronics industry downturn that occurred in and we did not expect that we would find a buyer that would utilize the special purpose space 
we also recorded an impairment charge of million on the 
table of contents microlithography business equipment based upon management s review of its business equipment and its estimated fair value under sfas  accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
after two years of marketing the building  in february we sold our  square foot allen  texas facility  together with the majority of the business equipment for its special purpose clean room facility space  to an electronics industry buyer and received approximately million in net cash proceeds from the sale 
the sale price was in excess of the value we had assumed for office space use 
the building and property  plant and equipment sold was recorded on our balance sheet at approximately million as of the closing date of the sale 
we retained ownership of approximately four acres of land adjacent to the allen site 
we recorded a gain of million in operations on the sale 
concurrent with the sale  we entered into a sublease of approximately  square feet of space in the facility for our legacy polaris system product group operations 
as the present value of the leaseback rentals was less than of the fair value of the facility  it was considered minor  and the entire gain of approximately million was recognized upon the close of the sale 
the lease was extended in the third quarter of fiscal to end on august   however  the company has an option to extend the sublease term for one additional period of months  by giving not less than days prior written notice 
the employee headcount for the pss group was reduced from approximately employees in february to employees at the end of fiscal we started to recognize the full financial savings of this reduction in the fourth quarter of fiscal the savings  consisting primarily of employee salaries and benefits from the third quarter restructuring  was approximately million for the fourth quarter of fiscal and approximately million in each of fiscal and fiscal our focus was to successfully wind down this business and transition it to the pss business 
our primary goals are to satisfy our remaining pss customer obligations and support requirements 
we are committed to providing a path for our customers to maximize the useful life for their polaris systems and have established key support services programs to support this goal 
transition agreement with metron technology on october   we entered into a transition agreement with metron technology related to the early termination of our distribution agreements with metron technology for europe and the asia pacific region  effective march  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of our relationship with metron technology 
sales revenue and shipments fiscal sales revenues were million as compared to million in fiscal the majority of the decrease in fiscal related to a decrease in domestic sales revenue from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in domestic sales revenue related to a decrease in domestic shipments from million in fiscal to million in fiscal related primarily to our transformation  beginning in march  from the microlithography business to a polaris systems and services product group 
fiscal sales revenues were million as compared to million for fiscal shipments were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in fiscal sales revenue as compared to fiscal  related primarily to an increase in shipments from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to improved industry conditions 
based upon our revenue recognition policy  certain shipments to customers are not recognized until customer acceptance 
therefore depending on timing of shipments and customer acceptances  there are time periods where shipments may exceed sales revenue or due to timing of acceptances  sales revenue may exceed shipments 
international sales were million for fiscal  representing of total sales during fiscal  million for fiscal  representing of total sales during fiscal  and million for 
table of contents fiscal  representing of total sales during fiscal international sales through our affiliates  m fsi ltd and metron technology  represented approximately of international sales during fiscal  of international sales during fiscal and of international sales during fiscal the minor dollar increase in international sales revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to increases in europe partially offset by decreases in asia 
the increase in the percentage of international sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal related primarily to the decrease in domestic sales revenue 
the increase in international sales revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal related to our transition to a direct global distribution model in march as well as improved industry conditions in international markets 
we experienced increased sales in all international markets in fiscal due to its broader customer base  sc products have a higher percentage of international sales than pss products 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company s international sales 
we ended fiscal with a backlog of approximately million as compared to million at the end of fiscal backlog consists of orders with delivery dates within the next months for which a customer purchase order has been received 
because of the timing and relative size of orders and the possibility of cancellations or customer delays  backlog is not necessarily indicative of sales for future periods 
deferred revenue was approximately million as of the end of fiscal deferred revenue is included in deferred profit which is net of deferred cost of goods sold on the consolidated balance sheet 
as a result of the fiscal year end backlog  deferred revenue levels and anticipated orders of to million in the first quarter of fiscal  we expect first quarter fiscal revenue to be in the range of to million 
achieving the high end of the revenue range requires receiving timely acceptance from customers for products that have been shipped 
gross margin our gross margin fluctuates due to a number of factors  including the mix of products sold  the proportion of international sales  as international sales  particularly in asia  generally have lower margins due to pricing pressures  the result of selling through our affiliate in japan  utilization of manufacturing capacity  the sales of pss product inventory previously written down to zero  and initial product placement discounts 
gross margin as a percentage of sales was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal and for fiscal the decrease in margins from fiscal to fiscal related primarily to an increase in manufacturing variances associated with the decrease in shipments from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease also related to the increase in the percentage of international sales as well as a decrease in the amount of the original cost of pss product inventory that had been written down to zero from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in margins from fiscal to fiscal was primarily impacted by inventory charges of million recorded in the second quarter of see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for discussion related to the pss product inventory charges 
the increase in gross margins for fiscal as compared to fiscal was also due to the product sales mix shift to sc products  our go direct initiative in asia and europe and an increase in spares and service revenue to over percent of total revenue in fiscal as compared to percent of total revenue in fiscal fiscal gross margins were also favorably impacted by million of changes in warranty estimates  primarily related to an sc product rework program in which actual costs were less than anticipated 
during fiscal  we had sales of pss product inventory with an original cost of approximately million that had previously been written down to zero 
this was primarily due to sales revenue generated from unanticipated pss refresh tools  spare parts and upgrade sales 
our gross margin as a percentage of sales for fiscal would have been if we included the original cost of the pss product inventory that had been written down to zero 
gross margin including the original cost of the pss product inventory that had been written down to zero is not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
our management believes that the presentation of gross

gross margins will be higher if inventory carried at a reduced cost is sold 
margins in fiscal were also impacted by  of severance costs that were recorded to cost of goods sold in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal we expect the gross profit margins for the first quarter of fiscal to be between to of revenues  due to an anticipated change in product mix and the lower margins on the initial placement of our products at strategic customers 
our factory utilization rate is not expected to change significantly  as first quarter of fiscal shipments are expected to be in the range of to million in line with the fourth quarter of fiscal level 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were million  or of total sales  as compared to million  or of total sales  in fiscal and million  or of total sales  in fiscal the decrease in the dollar amount of selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal related primarily to million of expense incurred in fiscal to settle patent infringement litigation in the second quarter of fiscal the decrease also related to a decrease in depreciation expense of approximately million primarily due to our sap computer software system being fully depreciated in fiscal these decreases were partially offset by an increase in salary expense associated with salary increases in january the increase in dollar amount of selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal related to the million patent infringement settlement expenses in the second quarter of fiscal  offset by a decrease in information technology expenses 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the patent infringement litigation settlement 
these increases in fiscal were also offset by savings related to organizational efficiencies from our transition to direct international distribution and the pss business model 
selling  general and administrative expenses include realignment charges of million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of fiscal are expected to be in the range of million to million  as we expand our service  product and program management resources in support of the demonstration programs with customers in all regions 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for fiscal were million  or of total sales  as compared to million  or of total sales in fiscal and million  or of total sales in fiscal the minor decrease in the dollar amount of research and development expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to the net impact of a million decrease in intangible asset amortization expense associated with our fiscal acquisition of yieldup  an increase in salary expense associated with salary increases in january and costs associated with new product development 
the decrease in the dollar amount of research and development expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal related to the reduction of engineering resources when we exited the resist processing market in march in addition  there was million of realignment charges in fiscal we expect research and development expenses to range from to million for the first quarter of fiscal as we continue to invest in new application and product development programs and continue to support our flagship products the magellan  the antares and the zeta systems 
gain on sale of facility we sold our facility in allen  texas in the second quarter of fiscal and received million in net cash proceeds from the sale

the change for fiscal as compared to fiscal related primarily to an approximately million non cash impairment charge in the first quarter of fiscal for the shares of metron technology that we owned 
interest income is expected to be approximately  to  for the first quarter of fiscal  given our current level of cash reserves and the anticipated interest rates 
gain on marketable securities gain on marketable securities was million in fiscal the gain was due to the gains on the nortem formerly metron technology distributions in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal gain on sale of marketable securities was million in fiscal the gain was due to the gain on the sales of approximately  shares of metron technology common stock in the first quarter of fiscal income tax benefit expense we recorded a tax expense of  in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  primarily as a result of state taxes

these provisions will not impact our tax rate in the near term due to the full valuation allowance 
the longer term impact will depend on the level of our profitability and the mix of domestic and international earnings 
equity in earnings losses of affiliates equity in earnings losses of affiliates was approximately  of income for fiscal   of income for fiscal  and million of losses for fiscal the decrease in fiscal earnings related to increased product development investments by m fsi ltd 
the change in fiscal related to improved financial performance for m fsi in fiscal due to improved industry conditions in japan 
in fiscal  metron technology wrote off a significant amount of its goodwill and incurred additional expenses in connection with the transition of its fsi product distribution business to fsi and the losses from metron technology were partially offset by a positive contribution from m fsi ltd 
during fiscal  we determined that audited financial statements of m fsi were required to be filed as an exhibit to our and annual reports on form k 
m fsi and its auditors are in the process of finalizing the us gaas generally accepted auditing standards audit on their fiscal and financial statements 
we anticipate filing an amendment to this form k to include the appropriate m fsi financial statements for their fiscal and as an exhibit 
historically  m fsi s financial statements have been stated in accordance with japanese accounting principles 
in fiscal  we no longer recorded equity in losses from metron technology  as our ownership  in metron technology had been below percent since the fourth quarter of fiscal in fiscal  applied materials  inc acquired the worldwide operating subsidiaries and business of metron technology 
see item business marketing  sales and support for a discussion of the metron technology disposition and liquidation 
we anticipate that equity in losses from m fsi ltd  our japanese affiliate  will be approximately  to  in the first quarter of fiscal as m fsi ltd expects that the timing of customer acceptances will impact their first quarter performance 
net income loss based upon achieving anticipated revenue  gross margin and operating expense levels  we expect to record a net loss of to million in the first quarter of fiscal liquidity and capital resources our cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were approximately million as of august   a decrease of million from the end of fiscal the net decrease was primarily due to million of cash used in operating activities  including million related to the hsu litigation settlement 
the decrease was also due to capital expenditures of million and million of investments in affiliate and a license fee 
the decreases were partially offset by million in proceeds from the sale of the allen  texas facility and million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
accounts receivable increased million from the end of fiscal the increase in trade accounts receivable related primarily to the timing of shipments in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal trade receivables will fluctuate quarter to quarter depending on individual customers timing of ship dates  payment terms and cash flow conditions 
the balance in trade accounts receivable from affiliate as of august  represented approximately of the fiscal sales to affiliate due primarily to the majority of fiscal shipments to affiliate occurring in our fiscal fourth quarter 
the timing of shipments to affiliate is impacted by our affiliate s receipt of customer purchase orders  our production lead times and the ultimate ship dates 

table of contents inventory decreased approximately million to million at the end of fiscal  as compared to million at the end of fiscal the decrease in inventory related primarily to a decrease in finished goods inventory associated with the sale of demonstration tools in fiscal inventory reserves were million at august  as compared to reserves of million at the end of fiscal the decrease in inventory reserves related primarily to the disposal of million of obsolete inventory  including the disposal of million of obsolete pss product inventory during fiscal the pss product inventory reserves were million at august  as compared to million at the end of fiscal we disposed of million of obsolete pss product inventory in fiscal and million in fiscal since we recorded the pss product inventory reserves as a result of the wind down of our microlithography business in the second quarter of fiscal  we have had sales of pss product inventory that had previously been written down to zero and reductions in inventory buyback requirements of million and have disposed of million of pss product inventory 
the original cost of pss product inventory available for sale or to be disposed of as of august  was million 
trade accounts payable decreased approximately million to million as of august  as compared to million at the end of fiscal the decrease in trade accounts payable related primarily to a decrease in inventory purchases related to a decrease in forecasted shipments as a result of lower bookings 
deferred profit increased approximately million to million at the end of fiscal  as compared to million at the end of fiscal the increase relates primarily to the mix of products deferred with higher margin products deferred as of the end of fiscal as compared to the end of fiscal as of august   our current ratio was to  and working capital was million 
the following table provides aggregate information about our contractual payment obligations and the periods in which payments are due in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total other long term liabilities represent payments related to a patent litigation settlement and minimum royalty payments or discounts granted under a license agreement 
as of august   we had guarantees totaling  related to auto leases  vat and payroll requirements in europe 
these guarantees were collateralized with  of restricted cash 
capital expenditures were million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal we expect capital expenditures to be less than  in the first quarter of fiscal depreciation and amortization is expected to be between approximately and million in the first quarter of fiscal at the expected revenue and expense run rate  we anticipate using to million of cash for operations in the first quarter of fiscal we believe that with existing cash  cash receipts  cash equivalents  marketable securities and internally generated funds  there will be sufficient funds to meet our currently projected working capital requirements  and to meet other cash requirements through at least fiscal we believe that success in our industry requires substantial capital to maintain the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they arise 
one of our strategic objectives is  as market and business conditions warrant  to consider divestitures  investments or acquisitions of businesses  products or 
table of contents technologies particularly those that are complementary to our surface conditioning business 
we may fund such activities with additional equity or debt financing 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities  whether to maintain flexibility or to meet strategic objectives  could result in additional dilution to our shareholders 
we currently do not have a line of credit arrangement 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs 
this statement requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement is effective for inventory costs incurred beginning in our first quarter of fiscal the implementation of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
sfas no 
r is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services through share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant 
the cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
sfas no 
r is effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after june  and we adopted this standard august  using the modified prospective method 
beginning in fiscal  our results of operations will reflect compensation expense for new stock options granted under our stock incentive plan  and for the unvested portion of previous stock options granted 
while we cannot precisely determine the impact on net earnings as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r  we estimate our equity based compensation expense will be between million and million for fiscal year the decrease in the expected expense in fiscal compared to the pro forma expense of million in fiscal is due primarily to the reduction in unvested options as of the beginning of fiscal versus earlier years due to the acceleration of vesting of unvested options during the third quarter of fiscal the ultimate amount of equity based compensation expense will be dependent on the number of option shares granted during the year  as well as the timing  the vesting period  and the determined fair value of the awards  and other factors such as future forfeitures 
risk factors our business faces significant risks 
the risks described below are not the only risks we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks occurs  our business  operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information and risks set forth in this report 
because our business depends on the amount that manufacturers of microelectronics spend on capital equipment  downturns in the microelectronics industry may adversely affect our results 
the microelectronics industry experiences periodic downturns  which may have a negative effect on our sales and operating results 
our business depends on the amounts that manufacturers of 
table of contents microelectronics spend on capital equipment 
the amounts they spend on capital equipment depend on the existing and expected demand for semiconductor devices and products that use semiconductor devices 
when a downturn occurs  some semiconductor manufacturers experience lower demand and increased pricing pressure for their products 
as a result  they are likely to purchase less semiconductor processing equipment and have sometimes delayed making decisions to purchase capital equipment 
in some cases  semiconductor manufacturers have canceled or delayed orders for our products 
typically  the semiconductor equipment industry has experienced more pronounced decreases in net sales than the semiconductor industry as a whole 
we  along with others in the semiconductor equipment industry  have recently experienced a downturn in orders for new equipment as well as delays in or cancellations of existing orders 
we cannot predict the extent and length of the current softening in the industry 
in addition the semiconductor equipment industry may experience other  possibly more severe and prolonged  downturns in the future  any future recovery of the microelectronics industry may not result in an increased demand by semiconductor manufacturers for capital equipment or our products  and the semiconductor equipment industry may not improve in the near future or at all 
failure of our products to gain market acceptance would adversely affect our financial condition 
we believe that our growth prospects depend upon our ability to gain customer acceptance of our products and technology  particularly newly developed products 
market acceptance of products depends upon numerous factors  including compatibility with existing manufacturing processes and products  ability to displace incumbent suppliers or processes or tools of record  perceived advantages over competing products  and the level of customer service available to support such products 
moreover  manufacturers often rely on a limited number of equipment vendors to meet their manufacturing equipment needs 
as a result  market acceptance of our products may be affected adversely to the extent potential customers utilize a competitor s manufacturing equipment 
there can be no assurance that sales of new products will remain constant or grow or that we will be successful in obtaining broad market acceptance of our systems and technology 
we expect to spend a significant amount of time and resources to develop new systems and enhance existing systems 
in light of the long product development cycles inherent in our industry  we will make these expenditures well in advance of the prospect of deriving revenue from the sale of any new systems 
our ability to commercially introduce and successfully market any new systems is subject to a wide variety of challenges during this development cycle  including start up bugs  design defects and other matters that could delay introduction of these systems to the marketplace 
in addition  since our customers are not obligated by long term contracts to purchase our systems  our anticipated product orders may not materialize or orders that do materialize may be canceled 
as a result  if we do not achieve market acceptance of new products  we may not be able to realize sufficient sales of our systems in order to recoup research and development expenditures 
the failure of any of our new products  for example the magellan  to achieve market acceptance would harm our business  financial condition  and results of operations and cash flows 
if we do not continue to develop new products  we will not be able to compete effectively 
our business and results of operations could decline if we do not develop and successfully introduce new or improved products that the market accepts 
the technology used in microelectronics manufacturing equipment and processes changes rapidly 
industry standards change constantly and equipment 
table of contents manufacturers frequently introduce new products 
we believe that microelectronics manufacturers increasingly rely on equipment manufacturers like us to design and develop more efficient manufacturing equipment  design and implement improved processes for microelectronics manufacturers to use  and make their equipment compatible with equipment made by other equipment manufacturers 
to compete  we must continue to develop  manufacture  and market new or improved products that meet changing industry standards 
to do this successfully  we must select appropriate products  design and develop our products efficiently and quickly  implement our manufacturing and assembly processes efficiently and on time  make products that perform well for our customers  market and sell our products effectively  and introduce our new products in a way that does not unexpectedly reduce sales of our existing products 
product or process development problems could harm our results of operations 
our products are complex  and from time to time have defects or bugs that are difficult and costly to fix 
this can harm our results of operations in the following ways we may incur substantial costs to ensure the functionality and reliability of products early in their life cycle  repeated defects or bugs can reduce orders  increase manufacturing costs  adversely impact working capital and increase service and warranty expenses  and we may require significant lead times between product introduction and commercialization 
as a result  we may have to write off inventory and other assets related to products and could lose customers and revenue 
there is no assurance that we will be successful in preventing product and process development problems that could potentially harm our results of operations 
it may be difficult for us to compete with stronger competitors resulting from industry consolidation 
in the past several years  we have seen a trend toward consolidation in the microelectronics equipment industry 
we expect the trend toward consolidation to continue as companies seek to strengthen or maintain their market positions in a rapidly changing industry 
we believe that industry consolidations may result in competitors that are better able to compete 
this could have a significant negative impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
future acquisitions may dilute our shareholders ownership interests and have other adverse consequences 
because of consolidations in the semiconductor equipment industry we serve and other competitive factors  our management will seek to acquire additional product lines  technologies  and businesses if suitable opportunities develop 
acquisitions may result in the issuance of our stock  which may dilute our shareholders ownership interests and reduce earnings per share 
acquisitions also may increase debt levels and the related goodwill and other intangible assets  which could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and operating results 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in absorbing the new business  product line  or technology  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  
table of contents entering new markets in which we have little or no experience  and possible loss of key employees of the acquired business 
because of the volatility of our stock price  the ability to trade fsi shares may be adversely affected and our ability to raise capital through future equity financing may be reduced 
our stock price has been volatile in the past and may continue to be so in the future 
in fiscal  our stock price ranged from to per share and in fiscal  our stock price ranged from to per share 
the trading price of our common shares is subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors  some of which are beyond our control  including factors discussed elsewhere in this report and the following failure to meet the published expectations of securities analysts for a given period  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  press releases or announcements by  or changes in market values of  comparable companies  additions or departures of key personnel  and involvement in or adverse results from litigation 
the prices of technology stocks  including ours  have been particularly affected by extreme fluctuations in price and volume in the stock market generally 
these broad stock market fluctuations may have a negative effect on our future stock price 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
in the future we could be the target of this type of litigation 
securities litigation may result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which can seriously harm our business 
because our quarterly operating results are volatile  our stock price could fluctuate 
in the past  our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter and are likely to do so in the future 
these fluctuations may have a significant impact on our stock price 
the reasons for the fluctuations in our operating results  such as sales  gross profits  and net income  include the timing of significant customer orders and customer spending patterns 
during industry downturns  our customers may ask us to delay or even cancel the shipment of equipment orders 
delays and cancellations may adversely affect our operating results in any particular quarter if we are unable to recognize revenue for particular sales in the quarter in which we expected those sales 
the timing of customer acceptances 
based on our revenue recognition policy  certain shipments to customers are not recognized until customer acceptance 
delays of customer acceptances may adversely affect our operating results in any particular quarter if we are unable to recognize revenue for particular sales in the quarter in which we expected those sales 
the timing of new product and service announcements by us or our competitors 
new product announcements by us and our competitors could cause our customers to delay a purchase or to decide to purchase products of one of our competitors which would adversely affect our revenue and  therefore  our results of operations 
new product announcements by others may make it necessary for us to reduce prices on our products or offer more service options  which could adversely impact operating margins and net income 
the mix of products sold and the market acceptance of our new product lines 
the mix of products we sell varies from period to period  and because margins vary among or within different product lines  this can adversely affect our results of operations 
if we fail to sell our products 
table of contents which generate higher margins  our average gross margins may be lower than expected 
if we fail to sell our new product lines  our revenue may be lower than expected 
general global economic conditions or economic conditions in a particular region 
when economic conditions in a region or worldwide worsen  customers may delay or cancel their orders 
there also may be an increase in the time it takes to collect payment from our customers or even outright payment defaults 
this can negatively affect our cash flow and our results 
as a result of these factors  our future operating results are difficult to predict 
further  we base our current and future expense plans in significant part on our expectations of our longer term future revenue 
as a result  we expect our expense levels to be relatively fixed in the short run 
an unanticipated decline in revenue for a particular quarter may disproportionately affect our net income in that quarter 
if our revenue is below our projections  then our operating results will also be below expectations 
any one of the factors we list above  or a combination of them  could adversely affect our quarterly results of operations  and consequently may cause a decline in our share price 
because of our ownership position in m fsi ltd  adverse results of m fsi ltd could adversely affect our results 
the profits or losses of our affiliate  m fsi ltd  can also significantly affect our financial results 
we have a interest in m fsi ltd 
if this affiliate loses the business of a significant company for which it distributes or sells products  loses a significant customer  or otherwise became less financially viable  it could have a negative effect on our financial condition 
changes in demand caused by fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates may reduce our international sales 
almost all of our direct international sales are denominated in us dollars 
nonetheless  changes in demand caused by fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates may affect our international sales 
sales for m fsi ltd are denominated in yen 
as a result  us dollar yen exchange rates may affect our equity interest in m fsi ltd s earnings 
m fsi ltd sometimes engages in so called hedging or risk reducing transactions to try to limit the negative effects that the devaluation of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could have on operating results 
m fsi ltd will do so if a sale denominated in a foreign currency is sufficiently large to justify the costs of hedging 
to hedge a sale  m fsi ltd typically will commit to buy us dollars and sell the foreign currency at a given price at a future date 
if the customer cancels the sale  m fsi ltd may be forced to buy us dollars and sell the foreign currency at market rates to meet its hedging obligations and may incur a loss in doing so 
to date  the hedging activities of m fsi ltd have not had any significant negative effect on us 
because we assumed direct sales  service and applications support and logistics responsibilities for our products in europe and the asia pacific region starting in march  we incur labor  service and other expenses in foreign currencies 
as of august   we had not entered into any hedging activities and our foreign currency transaction loss for fiscal was insignificant 
we intend to evaluate various hedging activities and other options to minimize fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
there is no assurance that we will be successful in minimizing foreign exchange rate risks and such failure may reduce our international sales or negatively impact our operating results 
because of the need to meet and comply with numerous foreign regulations and policies  the potential for change in the political and economic environments in foreign jurisdictions and the difficulty of managing business overseas  we may not be able to sustain our historical level of international sales 
we operate in a global market 
in fiscal  approximately of our sales revenue derived from sales outside of the united states 
in fiscal  approximately of our sales revenue derived from sales outside the united states 
in fiscal  approximately of our sales revenue derived from sales 
table of contents outside the united states 
we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of total sales 
sales to customers outside the united states involve a number of risks  including the following imposition of government controls  compliance with us export laws and foreign laws  political and economic instability  trade restrictions  changes in taxes and tariffs  longer payment cycles  difficulty of administering business overseas  and general economic conditions 
in particular  the japanese and asia pacific markets are extremely competitive 
the semiconductor device manufacturers located there are very aggressive in seeking price concessions from suppliers  including equipment manufacturers like us 
we seek to meet technical standards imposed by foreign regulatory bodies 
however  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to comply with those standards in the future 
any failure by us to design products to comply with foreign standards could have a significant negative impact on us 
because of the significant financial resources needed to offer a broad range of products  to maintain customer service and support and to invest in research and development  we may be unable to compete with larger  better established competitors 
the microelectronics equipment industry is highly competitive 
we face substantial competition throughout the world 
we believe that to remain competitive  we will need significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products  to maintain customer service and support  and to invest in research and development 
we believe that the microelectronics industry is becoming increasingly dominated by large manufacturers who have the resources to support customers on a worldwide basis 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  and customer support capabilities than us 
large equipment manufacturers have or may enter the market areas in which we compete 
in addition  smaller  emerging microelectronics equipment companies provide innovative technology 
we expect that our competitors will continue to improve the design and performance of their existing products and processes 
we also expect them to introduce new products and processes with better performance and pricing 
we cannot guarantee that we will continue to compete effectively in the united states or elsewhere 
we may be unable to continue to invest in marketing  research and development and engineering at the levels we believe necessary to maintain our competitive position 
our failure to make these investments could have a significant negative impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
because we do not have long term sales commitments with our customers  if these customers decide to reduce  delay or cancel orders or choose to deal with our competitors  then our results will be adversely affected 
if our significant customers reduce  delay  or cancel orders  then our operating results could suffer 
our largest customers have changed from year to year  however  sales to our top five customers accounted for approximately of total sales in fiscal  of total revenues in fiscal and of total revenues in fiscal texas instruments accounted for approximately of total sales in fiscal  of total sales in fiscal and of total sales in fiscal samsung electronics accounted for approximately of total sales in fiscal ibm accounted for approximately of total sales in fiscal we currently have no long term sales commitments with any of our customers 
instead  we 
table of contents generally make sales under purchase orders 
all orders are subject to cancellation or delay by the customer 
our backlog may not result in future net sales 
we schedule the production of our systems based in part upon order backlog 
due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
in addition  while we evaluate each customer order on a case by case basis to determine qualification for inclusion in backlog  there can be no assurance that amounts included in backlog ultimately will result in future sales 
a reduction in backlog during any particular period  or the failure of our backlog to result in future sales  could harm our business 
because we depend upon our management and technical personnel for our success  the loss of key personnel could place us at a competitive disadvantage 
our success depends to a significant extent upon our management and technical personnel 
the loss of a number of these key persons could have a negative effect on our operations 
competition is high for such personnel in our industry in all of our locations 
we periodically review our compensation and benefit packages to ensure that they are competitive in the marketplace and make adjustments or implement new programs for that purpose  as appropriate 
we cannot guarantee that we will continue to attract and retain the personnel we require to continue to grow and operate profitably 
our employment costs in the short term are to a large extent fixed  and therefore any unexpected revenue shortfall could adversely affect our operating results 
our operating expense levels are based in significant part on our headcount  which generally is driven by longer term revenue goals 
for a variety of reasons  particularly the high cost and disruption of lay offs and the costs of recruiting and training  our headcount in the short term is  to a large extent  fixed 
accordingly  we may be unable to reduce employment costs in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue or gross margin shortfall  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
because our intellectual property is important to our success  the loss or diminution of our intellectual property rights through legal challenge by others or from independent development by others  could adversely affect our business 
we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents  copyrights  trade secrets  and other measures 
however  we believe that our financial performance will depend more upon the innovation  technological expertise  and marketing abilities of our employees than on such protection 
in connection with our intellectual property rights  we face the following risks our pending patent applications may not be issued or may be issued with more narrow claims  patents issued to us may be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented  rights granted under issued patents may not provide competitive advantages to us  foreign laws may not protect our intellectual property rights  and others may independently develop similar products  duplicate our products  or design around our patents 
as is typical in the semiconductor industry  we occasionally receive notices from others alleging infringement claims 
we have been involved in patent infringement litigation in the past and we could become involved in similar lawsuits or other patent infringement claims in the future 
we cannot guarantee the outcome of such lawsuits or claims  which may have a significant negative effect on our business or operating results 

table of contents we are currently exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims 
we have in the past and may in the future be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement  intellectual property rights  contracts and other matters 
these legal proceedings and claims  whether with or without merit  could be time consuming and expensive to prosecute or defend  and could divert management s attention and resources 
there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of future legal proceedings or claims 
if we are not able to resolve a claim  negotiate a settlement of the matter  obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms and or successfully prosecute or defend its position  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our sales cycle is long and unpredictable  which could require us to incur high sales and marketing expenses with no assurance that a sale will result 
sales cycles for some of our products can run as long as to months 
as a result  we may not recognize revenue from efforts to sell particular products for extended periods of time 
we believe that the length of the sales cycle may increase as some current and potential customers centralize purchasing decisions into one decision making entity 
we expect this may intensify the evaluation process and require us to make additional sales and marketing expenditures with no assurance that a sale will result 
we are subject to internal controls evaluations and attestation requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we must perform evaluations of our internal controls over financial reporting 
beginning as of the end of fiscal and annually thereafter  we must include with our form k a report on our management s assessment of the adequacy of such internal controls  and our independent registered public accounting firm must publicly attest to the adequacy of management s assessment and the effectiveness of our internal controls 
we have prepared and are implementing a plan of action for compliance 
compliance with these requirements is complex and time consuming 
if we fail to timely or successfully comply with the requirements of section  or if our independent registered public accounting firm does not timely attest to the evaluation  we could be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny and the public s perception of us may change 
changes to financial accounting standards may affect our reported results of operations 
we prepare our financial statements to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the gaap are subject to interpretation by the american institute of certified public accountants  the securities and exchange commission  the financial accounting standards board and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies 
a change in those policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced 
accounting policies affecting many other aspects of our business  including rules relating to purchase accounting for business combinations  revenue recognition  in process research and development charges  employee stock purchase plans and stock option grants  have recently been revised or are under review 
changes to those rules or the questioning of our current accounting practices may have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results or on the way we conduct business 
in addition  our preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of those assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statement and the recorded amounts of expenses during the reporting period 
a change in the facts and circumstances surrounding those estimates could result in a change to our estimates and could impact our future operating results 

table of contents we do not intend to pay dividends 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth and  therefore  do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates due to investments in foreign based affiliates 
as of august   our investments in affiliate included a interest in m fsi ltd  which operates in japan 
we denominate the majority of our sales outside of the us in us dollars 
because we assumed direct sales  service and applications support and logistics responsibilities for our products in europe and the asia pacific region starting in march  we have and will continue to incur labor  service and other expenses in foreign currencies 
as a result  we may be exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rate risks 
as of august   we had not entered into any hedging activities and our foreign currency transaction loss for fiscal was insignificant 
we are currently evaluating various hedging activities and other options to minimize these risks 
we do not have significant exposure to changing interest rates as all material outstanding debt was repaid on september  as of the end of fiscal  amortized cost approximated market value for all outstanding marketable securities 
we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to interest rate risk and we are not party to any interest rate risk management transactions 
the impact on loss before income taxes of a change in short term interest rates would be approximately  based on cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of august
