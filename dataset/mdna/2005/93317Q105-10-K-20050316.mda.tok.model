item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis is based on  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  particularly note of notes to consolidated financial statements which presents net sales and revenues and operating income by operating segment 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements or disclosed in the related notes thereto 
management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consultation with experts and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from management s estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
management believes the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue based on the recognition criteria set forth in the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements 
homebuilding the company s homebuilding operations involve three principal types of homebuilding transactions a 
selling a home constructed for consumers on real estate owned by the consumer on your lot sales  b 
selling modular homes constructed in a factory principally to distributors for re sale to consumers modular sales  c 
selling a home constructed for consumers on real estate owned by the consumer but encumbered by a previous borrowing real estate sales  sales for cash at closing do occasionally occur for each of the above categories 
however  except for modular sales  most sales involve some form of seller financing 
on your lot sales constitute the majority of the sales in the homebuilding business approximately of new units sold in 
since the real estate land is already owned by the customer and is not financed by the company  these transactions represent sales of personal property financed by instalment sales contracts notes 
revenue from the construction and sale of a home is recognized upon completion of construction and legal transfer of ownership to the customer 
modular sales are the second largest component of homebuilding sales 
these sales are made principally to distributors for resale to consumers and do not involve sales of real estate 
sales are made under various customary industrial credit terms  with receivables typically due within to days following delivery 
revenue is recognized when legal ownership has transferred and upon delivery to the distributor or to a customer site 
for real estate sales  the company finances both a home and the related real estate 
revenues on real estate sales are recognized by the full accrual method in accordance with sfas  accounting for sales of real estate  when a 
the sale is consummated at closing with the customer after construction is completed and legal transfer of ownership has occurred 
b 
the buyer s initial cash investment is no less than of the sales value 
the buyer s continuing investment is required to be a level monthly payment sufficient to amortize the borrowing over a term not to exceed years 
c 
the company s receivable is secured by a first mortgage and is not subject to future subordination 
d 
the company transfers to the buyer the risks and rewards of ownership and does not have any continuing involvement with the property 
financing within the financing segment  msh purchases and services mortgage instalment notes originated by jwh and wmc offers financing to homebuyers that is secured by mortgages and liens 
references to instalment notes or mortgage instalment notes include mortgage loans offered by wmc 
instalment notes receivable are initially recorded at the discounted value of the future instalment note payments using an imputed interest rate in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
interest on receivables and payables  apb by jwh 
the imputed interest rate used represents the estimated prevailing market rate of interest for credit of similar terms issued to customers with similar credit ratings to jwh s customers 
the company estimates this rate by adding a credit spread and a margin to a benchmark funding rate in order to cover costs and expected losses 
this rate is periodically compared to rates charged by competitors and other lenders to customers of similar credit quality to validate that the methodology results in a market rate of interest 
these estimates affect revenue recognition by determining the allocation of income between the amount recognized by the homebuilding segment from the construction of the home and the amount recognized by the financing segment over the life of the instalment note as interest income 
variations in the estimated market rate of interest used to initially record instalment notes receivable could affect the amount and timing of income recognition in each of these segments 
instalment note payoffs received in advance of scheduled maturity prepayments cause interest income to increase due to the recognition of remaining unamortized discounts arising from the application of apb at the note s inception 
the interest income on instalment notes generated by both msh and wmc is recognized using the interest method 
the legal instruments used in each company allow for different amounts to be charged to the customer for late fees and ultimately recognized as revenue 
jwh offers instalment notes  which state the maximum amount to be charged to the customer  and ultimately recognized as revenue  based on the contractual number of payments and dollar amount of monthly payments 
wmc offers mortgage loans that have fixed monthly payments and repayment terms similar to instalment notes 
both msh and wmc have the ability to levy costs to protect their collateral position upon default  such as attorney fees and late charges as allowed by state law 
instalment notes and mortgage loans are placed on non accrual status when any portion of the principal or interest is ninety days past due 
when placed on non accrual status  the related interest accrued is reversed against interest income of the current period 
instalment notes are removed from non accrual status when the amount financed and the associated interest income become current 
recoveries of advanced taxes and insurance related to instalment notes are recognized as income when collected 
the financing segment sells homes and related real estate repossessed or foreclosed on by msh or wmc from customers in default of their loans or notes repo sales 
repo sales involve the sale and in most circumstances the financing of both a home and related real estate 
revenues from repo sales are recognized in accordance with sfas by the full accrual method where appropriate 
however  the requirement for a minimum initial cash investment per sfas is frequently not met 
when this is the case  losses are immediately recognized  and gains are deferred and recognized by the instalment method until the buyer s investment reaches the minimum 
at that time  revenue is recognized by the full accrual method 
industrial products for shipments via rail or truck  revenue is recognized when title passes upon delivery to the customer 
revenue earned for shipments via ocean vessel is recognized under international shipping standards as defined by incoterms when title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
natural resources for coal shipments via rail  revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss transfer to the customer when the railcar is loaded 
revenue earned for coal shipments via ocean vessel is recognized under international shipping standards as defined by incoterms when title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
for the company s natural gas operations  revenues are recognized when the gas has been transferred to the customers pipeline  at which time transfer of title occurs 
other for products shipped via rail or truck  revenue is recognized when the product is placed on the rail or in the truck  which is when risk of loss and title transfers to the customer 
land sales are recognized as revenue when legal transfer of ownership to the buyer occurs  which is at closing 
given the diversity of the company s businesses  many transactions have unique characteristics  which have to be analyzed on a case by case basis 
this diversity of products and contracts can lead to variations in the timing of income recognition 
however  most transactions are not individually significant  nor could they materially impact earnings 
allowances for losses allowances for losses on trade and other accounts receivable are based  in large part  upon judgments and estimates of expected losses and specific identification of problem trade accounts and other receivables 
significantly weaker than anticipated industry or economic conditions could impact customers ability to pay or could impact the value of underlying collateral such that actual losses are greater than the amounts provided for in these allowances 
management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for losses on instalment notes is based on the company s past loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  delinquencies  the estimated value of the underlying real estate collateral and current economic and market conditions within the applicable geographic areas surrounding the underlying real estate 
the allowance for losses on instalment notes and mortgage loans is increased by provisions for losses charged to income and is reduced by charge offs net of recoveries 
employee benefits the company provides a range of benefits to its employees and retired employees  including pensions and postretirement healthcare 
the company records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by generally accepted accounting principles  which include various actuarial assumptions including the following pension benefits other benefits december  december  december  december  weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations discount rate rate of compensation increase weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic cost discount rate expected return on plan assets rate of compensation increase assumed health care cost trend rates health care cost trend rate assumed for the next year rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline the ultimate trend rate year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate the discount rate used to determine pension and other post retirement expense was decreased to for from used in the rate of return on plan assets used to determine pension expense is for both and the discount rate is based on a model portfolio of aa rated bonds with a maturity matched to the estimated payouts of future pension benefits 
the expected return on plan assets is based on the company s expectation of the long term average rate of return on assets in the pension funds  which was modeled based on the current and projected asset mix of the funds and considering the historical returns earned on the type of assets in the funds 
the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
as required by us gaap  the effects of the modifications are amortized over future periods 
assumed health care cost trend rates  discount rates  expected return on plan assets and salary increases have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the pension and health care plans 
a one percentage point change in the rate for each of these assumptions would have the following effects in thousands percentage point increase percentage point decrease health care cost trend effect on total of service and interest cost components  effect on postretirement benefit obligation   discount rate effect on postretirement service and interest cost components effect on postretirement benefit obligation   effect on current year postretirement expense   effect on pension service and interest cost components effect on pension benefit obligation   effect on current year pension expense   expected return on plan assets effect on current year pension expense   rate of compensation increase effect on pension service and interest cost components effect on pension benefit obligation   effect on current year pension expense   the company also has significant liabilities for uninsured or partially insured employee related liabilities  including workers compensation liabilities  miners black lung benefit liabilities and liabilities for various life and health benefits 
the recorded amounts of these liabilities are based on estimates of loss from individual claims and on estimates determined on an actuarial basis from historical experience 
workers compensation and black lung benefit liabilities are also affected by discount rates used 
changes in the frequency or severity of losses from historical experience  changes in discount rates or actual losses on individual claims that differ materially from estimated amounts could affect the recorded amount of these liabilities 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rate on the discounted black lung liability would decrease the liability by million  while a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase the liability by million 
the company applies a discount rate at a risk free interest rate  generally a us treasury bill rate  for each policy year 
the rate used is one with a duration that corresponds to the weighted average expected payout period for each policy year 
once a discount rate is applied to a policy year  it remains the discount rate for the year until all claims are paid 
the use of this method decreases the volatility of the liability as impacted by changes in the discount rate 
litigation  investigations and claims the company is involved in litigation  investigations  and claims arising out of the normal conduct of its business  including those relating to commercial transactions  as well as environmental  health and safety matters 
the company estimates and accrues its liabilities resulting from such matters based on a variety of factors  including outstanding legal claims and proposed settlements  assessments by internal counsel of pending or threatened litigation  and assessments of potential environmental liabilities and remediation costs 
the company believes it has adequately accrued for these potential liabilities  however facts and circumstances may change that could cause the actual liability to exceed the estimates  or that may require adjustments to the recorded liability balances in the future 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company is in dispute with the internal revenue service the irs on a number of federal income tax issues 
the company believes that its tax filing positions have substantial merit and it intends to vigorously defend these positions 
the company has established accruals that it feels are sufficient to address claims  including related interest and penalties  where its defense may be unsuccessful or where a settlement of issues may be warranted 
the amount of the accrual is based on an assessment by management of both the probability and extent of loss for each of the disputed issues involved 
since the issues involved are highly complex  are subject to the uncertainties of extensive litigation and or administrative processes and may require an extended period of time to reach ultimate resolution  it is possible that management s estimate of this liability could change 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets including goodwill and other intangibles long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangibles  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the company periodically evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate possible impairment 
goodwill and other intangibles are also reviewed for possible impairment at least annually 
the company uses estimates of future cash flows of the related asset  asset grouping or reporting unit in measuring whether the assets are recoverable 
changes in actual or estimated future cash flows could have an impact on the recoverability of such assets  resulting in future impairment charges

the current and prior period results also include the impact of the factors discussed in the following segment analysis 
segment analysis homebuilding net sales and revenues were million during  a decrease of million  or from the prior period as a result of fewer unit completions  partially offset by higher average selling prices 
the higher selling price reflect price increases implemented in the first half of  as well as the company s on going strategy to market and sell larger homes with more amenities 
total unit completions decreased by or  compared to the prior year  as a result of lower volumes of new sales orders beginning in the last half of this reduction was due to a variety of factors  including reduced advertising and promotional initiatives 
additionally  during the third quarter of  a series of hurricanes and the resulting excessive rain caused construction delays  which reduced new starts and completions through much of the southeast 
this reduction also reflects market conditions that were weaker in the company s historical affordable housing market segment compared to the broader homebuilding industry 
excluding the modular business   units were completed in the current period  compared to  in the year ago period 
the modular business completed homes in the current period  fewer than the year ago period 
this reduction reflects a weak economic environment in the carolinas  the market area served by this business 
for the year ended december  homes completed   average net selling price   the segment operating loss was million for the year ended december   compared to an operating loss of million in the prior year 
this decrease was primarily due to fewer unit completions million  reduced margins primarily due to higher job and lumber costs million  increases in payroll costs million related to market adjustments to salaries  severance related to more than eliminated positions and a change in the commission structure 
additionally  other costs  primarily other employee costs increased million in compared to the prior year primarily related to hiring experienced industry personnel  consulting expenses  legal expenses and the closure of twenty six branches 
the homebuilding segment instituted one price increase in the fourth quarter of and two price increases in in response to rising lumber and other costs 
the first of these increases was effective october  and increased prices  the second was effective march  and increased prices and the third increase of was effective may  homebuilding has instituted new sales and marketing initiatives  including the creation of a new training program for its sales force and a more aggressive and focused approach to advertising  which  coupled with the redesign of its sales centers and enhanced model offerings  are among the revitalized business approaches being taken to drive higher volumes 
homebuilding is in the process of automating a new construction scheduling system and is upgrading the staffing and training in the purchasing and construction functions 
these actions are expected to improve cycle times and accelerate new starts 
because of the long lot preparation and building cycle in the scattered lot business  it normally requires six to eight months for new sales to generate revenues 
the homebuilding segment is expected to return to a profitable run rate during the fourth quarter of financing net sales and revenues were million in  an increase of million from the prior year 
this increase is attributable to higher prepayment related interest income and higher property insurance revenues 
operating income was million in  compared to million in the year ago period 
the segment results improved as a result of a decline in provision for losses on instalment notes  higher prepayment income prepayment speeds were in compared to in and lower interest expense partially offset by a million provision for estimated hurricane losses 
delinquencies the percentage of amounts outstanding over days past due were at december   down from at december   reflecting strong portfolio performance 
repossessed inventory units remained constant with units million at december   compared to units million at december  financing expects instalment notes  related debt balances and corresponding interest income and expense to decrease due to unit declines at homebuilding  which is expected to be partially offset by continued purchases of seasoned mortgages 
the financing segment has also completed a new warehouse facility for million  which will provide temporary financing for the purchases of instalment notes and loans 
additionally  the segment anticipates to spend to million for system upgrades over the next two years to upgrade its portfolio management capabilities 
industrial products net sales and revenues were million for the year ended december   an increase of million from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to higher sales prices and increased sales volumes  especially for ductile iron pipe which had a increase in average selling price and an increase in sales volume 
prices were lower in the prior year as a result of an industry price war that began in the second quarter of us pipe s pricing actions since june have offset scrap metal cost increases and other manufacturing costs 
the increase in revenue from increased selling prices was partially offset by a decrease in revenues from the southern precision and vestal manufacturing subsidiaries  which were sold in and  respectively 
operating income for the segment was million  compared to a million loss in the prior year 
the profit improvement in was primarily attributable to higher sales prices million  slightly higher volumes million  recoveries from an environmental related insurance settlement million  partially offset by higher costs for scrap metal and other materials million  higher manufacturing costs million  environmental costs million and higher costs related to workers compensation  salaries and wages  legal expenses and depreciation million 
the current year also includes a loss resulting from the sale of vestal manufacturing million 
prior year operating income includes charges related to restructuring costs to cease operations at the castings plant in annistion  alabama million  settled litigation matters million  write off of goodwill related to a disposed entity million  and settlement of a commercial dispute million 
significant increases in the cost of scrap metal occurred at us pipe in scrap metal is a primary raw material in the production of ductile iron pipe  accounting for up to of the costs of producing pipe 
historically averaging per net ton or less in costs  scrap metal cost averages were in excess of per ton in unparalleled scrap export volume  especially to china  has been the principal reason for the record high costs of scrap metal 
the company believes that these sales price increases have more than offset the increases in cost that have occurred and have and will continue to enable the company to enhance profitability 
however  the company s ability to achieve expected improved results is dependent on its continued ability to pass along scrap cost volatility to customers in the form of price increases 
this ability could be affected by the reactions of customers or competitors to these price increases 
natural resources net sales and revenues were million for the year ended december   an increase of million from million in the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to higher metallurgical coal and natural gas prices and increased coal production  partially offset by decreased natural gas volumes 
for the year ended december  average natural gas selling price per mcf billion cubic feet of natural gas sold number of natural gas wells average coal selling price per ton tons of coal sold million million the average natural gas selling prices shown for and include the effects of approximately million of hedge gains and million of hedge losses  respectively  on hedges of anticipated natural gas production and sales 
for  natural resources operating income was million  compared to an operating loss of million in the prior year 
the increase was due to higher metallurgical coal and natural gas sales prices and higher metallurgical coal volumes  partially offset by lower gas volumes  legal expenses related to the settlement of the mine no 
accident and increased employee related costs 
prior year operating income included million of restructuring charges related to the announced accelerated closure of mine no 
in december  the company announced that jwr expected to close mine no 
during the fourth quarter of  approximately two years earlier than originally scheduled  due to continuing adverse geologic conditions 
in april  the company announced that due to increases in metallurgical coal prices  it had extended its coal production schedule for mine no 
into in december  the company extended its coal production schedule for mine no 
into the fourth quarter of the company previously estimated total costs of the shutdown at approximately million  of which approximately million would qualify as restructuring costs 
as a result of the delay in the shutdown of the mine  total expected costs decreased to approximately million  of which approximately million would qualify as restructuring costs 
due to the change in the timing of the mine shutdown and the related decrease in estimated restructuring costs  the company remeasured the liability  which resulted in a million reversal during the first quarter of of amounts previously charged to restructuring expense in and million reversal during the fourth quarter of of amounts previously charged to restructuring expense during estimated costs associated with the restructuring are as follows in thousands total expected costs restructuring and impairment expenses recognized from inception to december  termination benefits   other employee related costs   other costs  total   on december   the company announced that it has approved up to million for a capital investment program to increase coal production capacity at mine no 
it is anticipated that the development of the program will occur over a four year period and increase annual production capacity by approximately million tons per year starting in the fourth quarter of capital expenditures for related to this expansion project are expected to be million 
in addition  at mine no  the company expects to spend million in to increase hoist capacity by to alleviate a forecasted bottleneck in the production process starting in early strong performance at natural resources is expected to continue in increased demand  particularly from china  as well as reduced supplies  has contributed to price increases in the world s metallurgical coal markets 
in the first quarter of  jim walter resources completed negotiations for most of its annual metallurgical coal supply contracts  which generally cover the period from july through june at prices of per ton  nearly double the contract level 
the price increase in metallurgical coal should have a positive impact on natural resources profitability in in  jim walter resources expects to produce between and million tons of coal  which is lower than primarily because output at mine no 
is expected to decline over the course of the year due to shorter panels and more difficult geologic conditions related to the remaining coal 
other net sales and revenues were million for compared to million in the prior year 
sloss revenues were million higher than the prior year  which were partially offset by land sales that were million lower than the prior year 
sloss revenues increased in due to overall increased sales volumes and higher prices for furnace and foundry coke  which increased and  respectively  over the prior year 
sloss operating income was million higher than the previous year due to higher coke volumes and increased pricing 
net general corporate expenses principally included in selling  general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in in  corporate expenses were higher due to employee costs of million primarily related to incentive compensation expense  higher professional service fees of million related to internal and external audit services related to implementation of sarbanes oxley act requirements and increased workers compensation and medical expenses

year ended december  and continuing operations net sales and revenues for the year ended december  were billion  substantially the same as in revenue decreases within the industrial products and other segments were offset by increases in the homebuilding and natural resources segments 
industrial products segment revenues decreased due to lower pipe  valve  hydrant and fittings volumes  partially offset by price increases 
the volume decline occurred during the course of as us pipe instituted multiple price increases 
these price increases were in response to rising scrap metal and other costs and an easing of the intense pricing competition within the industry that occurred in revenues for the other segment declined on lower sales volume for sloss  partially offset by higher pricing for furnace coke and increased sales of land 
homebuilding revenues improved on higher average selling prices  partially offset by lower unit completions 
revenues were higher in natural resources due to an increase in coal tons sold and higher natural gas prices  partially offset by a decrease in natural gas volumes and slightly lower coal prices 
cost of sales  exclusive of depreciation  of million was of net sales in versus million and of net sales in the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to increased costs of lumber and other building materials in the homebuilding segment  higher scrap metal  alloy  natural gas and other costs in the industrial products segment and higher production costs in the natural resources segment 
depreciation for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million compared with primarily due to increases at homebuilding and financing related to implementations of new enterprise systems and at natural resources due to capital expenditures for mining equipment 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  compared to million in the increase in the homebuilding segment was a result of higher costs related to a reorganization of the sales and construction organizations  as well as the implementation of a new enterprise system and new advertising and marketing initiatives 
industrial products increase principally related to the settlement of a class action employment matter of million 
in addition  there was an increase in environmental related expenses at sloss in of approximately million 
the increased costs in were partially offset by productivity and cost reduction programs in place throughout the company 
the results included a million charge to bad debt expense related to a sloss customer that filed for bankruptcy protection  as well as higher professional fees related to restating mid state home s accounting for interest income on instalment notes to the interest method 
provision for losses on instalment notes increased to million in  compared to million in due principally to anticipated increases in the estimated level of losses  as indicated by an increase in the number of repossessions and slightly higher losses on resales of repossessed homes 
postretirement benefits expense was million in  a reduction of million from due to plan amendments effective january   which placed a monthly cap on company contributions for salary post retirement healthcare coverage 
interest expense for mortgage backed and asset backed notes decreased to million in  compared to million in this reflected lower interest rates  partially offset by higher borrowings 
interest expense on corporate debt was million in versus million in this increase resulted from higher interest rates on the facility beginning in april  as compared to the previous facility  as well as the accelerated recognition of million of term loan debt issue costs and discount amortization as a result of mandatory debt repayments required by the sale of aimcor and jw aluminum in december the company recorded approximately million in restructuring and impairment charges during related to the cessation of various operations in the industrial products segment  the anticipated closure of mine no 
in the natural resources segment  and a write down of the company s former headquarters building to its net realizable value prior to its sale 
the company s effective income tax rate for the year ended december  differed from the federal statutory tax rate due to a reduction of income tax accruals as a result of the favorable settlement of a dispute with the irs  a deduction for depletion related to the company s mining operations  the effect of state and foreign income taxes and amortization of goodwill 
in july  the company favorably resolved a longstanding dispute with the irs concerning federal income tax returns for fiscal years ended may  and the irs had previously disallowed deductions of million and related legal fees of million associated with the settlement of veil piercing litigation in the bankruptcy proceedings 
the company successfully defended its position through an irs appeals process  and will not be required to pay income taxes related to this issue

prepayments are estimated based on historical experience and expectations about future economic conditions  particularly interest rates 
other long term liabilities include pension and other post employment benefit liabilities 
while the estimated total liability is actuarially determined  there are no definitive payments by period as pension contributions depend on government mandated minimum funding requirements and other post employment benefits are paid as incurred

restricted short term investments of million at december  are invested primarily in commercial paper maintaining a weighted average interest rate of as of december  a one hundred basis point decrease in the interest rate on these investments would result in a reduction of annual pre tax interest income of approximately million 
the company s fixed rate gross instalment notes receivables were billion and fixed rate mortgage backed asset backed notes were billion as of december  the fixed rate nature of these instruments and their offsetting positions effectively mitigate significant interest rate risk exposure from these instruments 
if interest rates decrease  the company may be exposed to higher prepayment speeds 
this could result in a modest increase in short term profitability 
however  it could adversely impact long term profitability as a result of a shrinking portfolio 
changes in interest rates may impact the fair value of these financial instruments 
the level of prepayments on the fixed rate instalment notes will fluctuate with changes in interest rates 
income generated from prepayments will vary each period based on the current interest rate environment and the interest rates associated with the outstanding instalment notes 
the trust ix variable funding loan facility does have a variable rate of interest that makes it subject to interest rate risk

costs potentially having a significant influence on the company include costs for lumber and other building materials  natural gas and scrap metal and steel 
the company is exposed to commodity price risk on sales and purchases of natural gas 
on an annual basis  the company s sales of natural gas  net of purchases  approximates seven million mmbtu s 
at december   the sales price of natural gas was approximately per mmbtu 
a decrease in the price per mcf could result in an estimated reduction in pre tax income of approximately million on an annual basis 
the company occasionally utilizes derivative commodity instruments to manage certain of these exposures where considered practical to do so 
such derivative instruments are held for other than trading 
during and  the company hedged approximately and  respectively of its natural gas production with swap contracts 
these swap contracts effectively converted a portion of forecasted sales at floating rate natural gas prices to a fixed rate basis 
as a result of decreases in natural gas prices during and increases in  these swap contracts resulted in cash inflows of million in and cash outflows of million in  impacting net sales and revenues
