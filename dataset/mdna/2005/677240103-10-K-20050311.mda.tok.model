item  management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operation on page of this annual report on form k 
the corporation continually evaluates the competitive environment within the insurance industry 
most high performing insurance companies  including a number of peer companies  have achieved combined ratios in the low to range 
also  the surplus positions of many of these companies have strengthened  while at the same time investment income growth has been constrained by the low yields on new investments 
in addition  the industry took less aggressive price increases in in most insurance product lines and had an increased focus on the quality of reinsurers 
recognizing that improved industry results may mean further price competition  the corporation has taken steps in to achieve improved profitability through expense reduction initiatives while maintaining disciplined underwriting and pricing 
in september  the corporation announced its corporate strategic plan for the time frame 
the plan brings together five broad objectives to help achieve the corporation s vision to be a leading super regional property and casualty carrier providing a broad range of products services through independent agents and brokers 
the broad objectives include the ability to generate above market growth  produce competitive loss ratios  create a competitive expense structure  achieve a competitive return on equity and improve credit ratings and financial flexibility 
competitive advantages include strong agency relationships  especially with key agents  and technology platforms that will provide superior operating flexibility 
technology is being leveraged to make it easier for agents to do business with the group and to increase pricing and underwriting sophistication

these policies also provide coverage to employees for their liability exposures under the common law  commercial automobile insurance insures policyholders against third party liability related to the ownership and operation of motor vehicles used in the course of business and property damage to insured vehicles 
these policies may provide uninsured motorist coverage  which provides coverage to insureds and their employees for bodily injury and property damage caused by an uninsured party  general liability insurance insures policyholders against third party liability for bodily injury and property damage  including liability for products sold and covers the cost of the defense of claims alleging such damages  and commercial multi peril insurance cmp insures a business against risks from property  liability  crime and boiler and machinery explosion losses

personal umbrella personal property total personal lines these product lines include personal automobile and homeowners insurance sold to individuals 
marketing and distribution the group is represented by approximately  independent insurance agencies with approximately  agents 
these agents also represent other unaffiliated companies which may compete with the group 
the six claim  underwriting and service offices operated by the group assist these independent agents in producing and servicing the group s business 
certain agencies that meet established profitability and production targets are eligible for key agent status 
at december   these agencies represented of the group s total agency force and wrote of its book of business 
the policies placed by key agents have consistently produced a lower loss ratio for the group than policies placed by other agents 
the group targets small business customers for its commercial lines segment 
the group s typical commercial lines customer is a small business with a limited number of employees that needs to conveniently purchase a package of coverages 
for the year  this commercial lines customer group  categorized by commercial liability premium volume  included approximately contractors artisans  mercantile  building premises  and manufacturers 
the group believes this small business customer group offers an opportunity to achieve superior underwriting results through development and maintenance of strong agent and customer relationships and application of the group s underwriting and pricing expertise 
the group markets its specialty lines segment predominately to policyholders who have purchased commercial automobile and general liability policies and have a need for additional coverage under umbrella policies to cover costs which might exceed the underlying policies limits or are not covered under such policies 
the group markets personal automobile insurance primarily to standard and preferred risk drivers 
standard and preferred risk drivers are those who have met certain criteria  including a driving record which reflects a low historical incidence of at fault accidents and moving violations of traffic laws 
the group does not target non standard risk drivers who fall outside these criteria 
item continued competition the property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive 
the group competes on the basis of service  price and coverage 
according to am best  based on net insurance premiums written in  the latest year for which industry wide comparison statistics are available more than billion of net premiums were written by property and casualty insurance companies in the united states and no one company or company group had a market share greater than approximately  and the group ranked as the forty eighth largest property and casualty insurance group in the united states

the naic also promulgates model insurance laws and regulations relating to the financial condition and operations of insurance companies  including the insurance regulating information system 
naic model laws and rules are not usually applicable unless enacted into law or promulgated into regulation by the individual states 
the adoption of naic model laws and regulations is a key aspect of the naic financial regulations standards and accreditation program  which also sets forth minimum staffing and resource levels for all state insurance departments 
ohio and indiana are accredited 
the naic has developed a risk based capital model for property and casualty insurers 
the model is used to establish standards  which relate insurance company statutory surplus to risks of operations and assist regulators in determining solvency requirements 
the standards are designed to assess capital adequacy and to raise the level of protection that statutory surplus provides for policyholders 
the risk based capital model measures the following four major areas of risk to which property and casualty insurers are exposed asset and liability risk  credit risk  underwriting risk  and off balance sheet risk 
the risk based capital model law requires the calculation of a ratio of total adjusted capital to authorized control level risk based capital 
insurers with a ratio below are subject to different levels of regulatory intervention and action 
based upon their statutory financial statements  all insurance companies in the group exceeded the necessary statutory capital requirements 
regulations on dividends the corporation is dependent on dividend payments from its insurance subsidiaries in order to meet operating expenses  debt obligations and to pay dividends 
insurance regulatory authorities impose various restrictions and prior approval requirements on the payment of dividends by insurance companies and holding companies 
this regulation allows dividends to equal the greater of of policyholders surplus or of the insurer s net income  each determined as of the preceding year end  without prior approval of the insurance department 
dividend payments to the corporation from the company are limited to approximately million during without prior approval of the ohio insurance department based on of the company s net income for the year ending december  additional restrictions limiting the amount of dividends paid by the company to the corporation may result from the minimum net worth and surplus requirements in the corporation s revolving credit agreement as disclosed in item  note  debt  on pages and of this annual report on form k 
item continued pooling agreement all of the company s insurance subsidiaries  except ocnj  have entered into an intercompany reinsurance pooling agreement with the company

the company  the lead company of the pool  will assume and retain of the pool s underwriting experience  therefore there will be no retrocessions to the company s insurance subsidiaries 
investments the distribution of the corporation s and the group s invested assets is determined by a number of factors  including rates of return  investment risks  insurance law requirements  diversification  liquidity needs  tax planning  general market conditions  and business mix and liability payout patterns 
periodically  the investment portfolios are reallocated subject to the parameters set by management  under the direction of the finance committee of the board of directors 
management evaluates the investment portfolio on a regular basis to determine the optimal investment strategy based upon the factors mentioned above 
throughout equity securities were sold  many of which had substantially appreciated in value compared to earlier periods 
this sale program was in response to a decision to reduce equity holdings in favor of investment grade fixed maturities 
assets relating to property and casualty operations are invested to maximize after tax returns with appropriate diversification of risk 
as a result of improved underwriting profitability  the corporation and group began to increase funds invested in tax exempt fixed maturities in this change will result in lower before tax item continued investment income  but will also be accompanied by a lower effective tax rate on investment income  due to the tax exempt status of the securities 
the portfolio strategy  with respect to common stocks  is to focus on large companies with dominant market positions  excellent profitability and strong balance sheets 
equity securities are marked to fair value on the consolidated balance sheets 
as a result  shareholders equity and statutory surplus fluctuate with changes in the value of the equity portfolio 
the effect of future stock market volatility is managed by maintaining an appropriate ratio of equity securities to shareholders equity and statutory surplus

liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses lae are established for the estimated ultimate costs of settling claims for insured events  both reported claims and incurred but not reported claims  based on information known as of the evaluation date 
the estimated liabilities include direct costs of the loss under terms of insurance policies  as well as legal fees and general expenses of administering the claims adjustment process 
because of the inherent future uncertainties in estimating ultimate costs of settling claims  actual losses and lae may deviate substantially from the amounts recorded in the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
furthermore  the timing  frequency and extent of adjustments to the estimated liabilities cannot be accurately predicted since conditions  events and trends which led to historical loss and lae development and which serve as the basis for estimating ultimate claims cost may not occur in the future in exactly the same manner  if at all 
as more information becomes available and claims are settled  the estimated liabilities are adjusted upward or downward with the effect of increasing or decreasing net income at the time of the adjustments 
the effect of these adjustments may have a material adverse impact on the results of operations of the group 
the following tables present an analysis of losses and lae and related liabilities for the periods indicated

reinsurance reinsurance is a contract by which one insurer  called a reinsurer  agrees to cover  under certain defined circumstances  a portion of the losses incurred by a primary insurer in the event a claim is made under a policy issued by the primary insurer 
the group purchases reinsurance to protect against large or catastrophic losses 
reinsurance contracts do not relieve the group of their obligations to policyholders 
the collectibility of reinsurance depends on the solvency of the reinsurers at the time any claims are presented 
the group monitors each reinsurer s financial health and claims settlement performance because reinsurance protection is an important component of the corporation s financial plan 
each year  the group reviews financial statements and calculates various ratios used to identify reinsurers who no longer meet appropriate standards of financial strength 
reinsurers who fail these tests are reviewed and those that are determined by the group to have insufficient financial strength are removed from the program at renewal 
additionally  a large number of reinsurers are utilized to mitigate concentration of risk 
the group also records an estimated allowance for uncollectible reinsurance amounts  as deemed necessary 
during the last three fiscal years  no reinsurer accounted for more than of total ceded premiums 
as a result of these controls  amounts of uncollectible reinsurance have not been significant 
there are several programs that provide reinsurance coverage and the programs in effect for are discussed in the reinsurance programs section of item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  on page of this annual report on form k 
seasonality the group s insurance business experiences modest seasonality with regard to premiums written  which are usually highest in january and july and lowest during the fourth quarter 
although written premium experiences modest seasonality  premiums are earned ratably over the period of coverage 
losses and lae incurred tend to remain consistent throughout the year  unless a catastrophe occurs 
catastrophes can occur at any time during the year from weather related events that include  but are not limited to  hail  tornadoes  hurricanes and windstorms

all dollar amounts in this management discussion and analysis md a are in millions unless otherwise noted 
the following discussion of financial condition and results of operation highlights significant factors influencing the consolidated results and financial position of the corporation 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes  all of which are integral parts of the following analysis of the results of operations and financial position 
executive level overview the corporation earns revenue by providing businesses and consumers with competitive insurance products with high quality service and by income on funds invested 
in  the corporation achieved meaningful improvement in financial performance 
net income increased in compared to as a result of a better priced book of business through realization of price increases in certain lines and an improved risk profile as a result of more disciplined underwriting 
the statutory expense ratio continued to improve as a result of expense management initiatives 
the statutory combined ratio was the best since the all lines statutory combined ratio improved to compared to in as a result of significantly improved loss experience  including lower loss adjustment expenses lae because of our cost reduction programs  which are continuing into the improved loss experience is the result of disciplined underwriting and enhanced pricing methodologies the corporation continues to develop and implement 
in addition  the corporation experienced favorable prior years reserve development for the first year since while full year premiums increased only slightly when compared to the prior year  the group s risk profile has improved as the focus was on disciplined underwriting  improving pricing methodologies and driving operational efficiencies and expense reductions throughout the organization 
the results of this focus and effort are discussed throughout the following sections 
in september  the corporation announced its corporate strategic plan for the time frame 
the plan brings together five broad objectives to help achieve the corporation s vision to be a leading super regional property and casualty carrier providing a broad range of products services through independent agents and brokers 
the broad objectives include abilities to generate above market growth  produce competitive loss ratios  create a competitive expense structure  achieve a competitive return on equity and improve credit ratings and financial flexibility 
competitive advantages include strong agency relationships  especially with key agents  and technology platforms that provide operating flexibility 
technology is being leveraged to make it easier for agents to do business with the group and to increase pricing and underwriting sophistication 
the corporation continues to execute against this plan and the corporation s results in are an indication that the plan and its execution are working 
the key financial indicators management utilizes consist of statutory combined ratios and component ratios on both a calendar year and accident year basis  gross and net written premium growth  impact of catastrophes  renewal price increases and investment income growth 
results of operations net income the corporation reported net income of  or per share  for  compared with  or per share  for the year  and a net loss of  or per share  in the corporation reported operating income of  or per share  for  compared with  or per share  for the year and an operating loss of  or per share  for item continued management of the corporation believes the significant volatility of realized investment gains and losses limits the usefulness of net income loss as a measure of current operating performance 
accordingly  management uses the non gaap financial measure of operating income loss to further evaluate current operating performance 
operating income loss  both in dollar amount and per share amount  is reconciled to net income loss in the table below december operating income loss after tax net realized gains cumulative effect of accounting change net income loss operating income loss per share diluted after tax net realized gains per share diluted cumulative effect of accounting change per share diluted net income loss per share diluted the corporation adopted the emerging issues task force eitf consensus the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share in december and as required by the eitf restated the average diluted shares outstanding and diluted net income per share for each of the three years presented in this md a using the if converted method 
the impact of the adoption of the eitf was a reduction to diluted net income per share of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the impact of this eitf on operating income per share was a reduction of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the year ended december  was not restated for either net income or operating income per share as the corporation incurred a net loss during that year  which resulted in the calculation being anti dilutive 
the improved financial results for were driven by significantly improved loss experience  including lower lae  a result of cost reduction programs that have been implemented 
the improved loss and lae ratios are the result of disciplined underwriting and improved pricing methodologies  reduced claim frequency  a decline in large losses losses greater than  per loss and favorable prior years reserve development 
catastrophe losses decreased in to during  underwriting and loss adjustment expenses were impacted by increased severance and other related costs  primarily associated with the cost structure efficiency cse initiative and expenses related to the proformance transaction 
as previously discussed  in ocnj entered into a transaction which effectively exited the group from the new jersey private passenger auto market 
based upon data through december  as provided by proformance in the first quarter of  the group estimated and accrued of which was paid in july related to this obligation 
during the second half of  the group accrued an additional at december   the group has accrued in the consolidated financial statements for any possible additional liability that may be incurred based upon the final liability calculation using proformance s results 
this amount  which is management s best estimate of the liability  reflects the maximum additional amount that could be required to be paid to proformance 
the group expects to resolve the final settlement to be paid to proformance relative to the surplus guarantee in the first half of for additional information on this transaction  see item  notes to consolidated financial statements  footnote on pages and of this annual report on form k 
decreases in personnel and sales related expenses led to the improved results for compared with staff reductions of in compared to were the result of the claim department reorganization and the lexington and indianapolis underwriting offices being consolidated into other locations 
the loss ratio improved in due to tighter underwriting standards and an improved risk profile 
in addition  development on prior accident years losses and lae decreased before tax from to before tax in these improved results were offset by increased catastrophe losses during catastrophe losses before tax more than doubled to in from in resulting from storms that swept through the midwest item continued and the effects of hurricane isabel 
during  the increase in provision for prior accident years losses and lae totaled before tax and was concentrated in the general liability  commercial auto and personal auto product lines 
the majority of the charge  before tax  occurred in the third quarter and was primarily related to construction defect claims for residential developers and contractors 
the group continues to address this specific type of business for non renewal 
for further discussion  refer to the loss and loss adjustment expenses section under liquidity and capital resources on pages of this md a 
investment results consolidated before tax net investment income was in  compared with in and in the decrease in consolidated before tax net investment income of is attributable to reinvestment yields being below average portfolio yields  the strategic decision to invest  or reinvest  more of the portfolio into tax exempt fixed maturities  increased investment expenses attributable to outside management fees and the allocation of interest income pertaining to investments held in the reinsurance treaty fund as part of the group s reinsurance program 
this decrease is partially offset by larger average portfolio holdings during than in and a favorable amortization adjustment on certain fixed income securities  with a portion of this adjustment representing a reclassification from realized gains 
the change in investment strategy to invest more into tax exempt securities is the result of improved profitability 
this change in investment strategy will result in the corporation s and the group s before tax investment income declining when compared to prior periods when the strategy was to invest in taxable securities 
as a result of this strategy  the corporation s and the group s effective tax rate on investment income will be lower when compared to these prior periods 
the increase in consolidated before tax net investment income of is attributable to an increase in investment assets held  partially offset by increased investment expenses attributable to the implementation of a new investment accounting system  lower average yields on its fixed income portfolio  and increased investment management fees from expanded use of outside investment managers 
as part of a conversion to a new investment accounting system in  before tax investment income was reduced by as a result of a change in accounting estimate relating to amortization of interest only mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
offsetting most of this charge was a credit for interest received on a federal income tax settlement 
consolidated before tax realized net investment gains amounted to  and for the years ended  and  respectively 
during  and  there were no significant realized losses on sales of securities 
in the first quarter of  management decided to transfer a portion of its fixed maturity securities from the available for sale classification into the held to maturity classification 
this transfer was made as the corporation and the group have both the ability to hold the securities to maturity and the positive intent to do so 
at december   the amortized cost of the held to maturity portfolio was invested assets comprise a majority of the consolidated assets 
consequently  accounting policies related to investments are critical 
see further discussion of important investment accounting policies in the critical accounting policies section of this md a and in item  notes to consolidated financial statements  footnote c on page of this annual report on form k 
the corporation and the group continually evaluate all of their investments based on current economic conditions  credit loss experience and other developments 
the difference between the cost and estimated fair value of investments is continually evaluated to determine whether a decline in value is temporary or other than temporary in nature 
this determination involves a degree of uncertainty 
if a decline in the fair value of a security is determined to be temporary  the decline is recorded as an unrealized loss  net of tax  in shareholders equity 
if there is a decline in a security s fair value that is considered to be other than temporary  the security is written down to the estimated fair value with a corresponding realized loss recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
the assessment of whether a decline in fair value is considered temporary or other than temporary includes management s judgement as to the financial position and future prospects of the entity issuing the security 
it is not possible to accurately predict when it may be determined that a specific security will become impaired 
item continued future impairment charges could be material to the results of operations 
the amount of the before tax other than temporary impairment charge recorded was  and for the years ended  and  respectively 
this impairment charge represents less than of the market value of the investment portfolio at december   and  respectively

the following tables summarize for all available for sale and held to maturity securities  the total gross unrealized losses  excluding gross unrealized gains  by investment category and length of time the securities have continuously been in an unrealized loss position as of december  and december  available for sale securities with unrealized losses less than months months or longer total fair value unrealized fair value unrealized fair value unrealized losses losses losses securities states  municipalities and political subdivisions corporate securities mortgage backed securities other total fixed maturities equity securities short term investments total temporarily impaired securities held to maturity securities with unrealized losses less than months months or longer total fair value unrealized fair value unrealized fair value unrealized losses losses losses securities corporate securities mortgage backed securities other total temporarily impaired securities item continued available for sale securities with unrealized losses less than months months or longer total unrealized unrealized unrealized fair value losses fair value losses fair value losses securities us government states  municipalities and political subdivisions corporate securities mortgage backed securities other total temporarily impaired securities held to maturity securities with unrealized losses less than months months or longer total unrealized unrealized unrealized fair value losses fair value losses fair value losses securities corporate securities mortgage backed securities other total temporarily impaired securities management believes that it will recover the cost basis in the securities held with unrealized losses as it has both the intent and ability to hold the securities until they mature or recover in value 
securities are sold to achieve management s investment goals  which include the diversification of credit risk  the maintenance of adequate portfolio liquidity  a competitive investment yield and the management of interest rate risk 
in order to achieve these goals  sales of investments are based upon current market conditions  liquidity needs and estimates of the future market value of the individual securities 
as part of its evaluation of the aggregate unrealized loss on securities in the investment portfolio at december   management performed a more intensive review of securities with a higher unrealized loss percentage when compared with their cost or amortized cost 
based on this review of each security  management believes that unrealized losses on these securities were temporary declines in value at december  in the table above  there are approximately securities represented 
of this total  securities have unrealized loss positions greater than of their market values at december   with none exceeding 
this group represents  or of the total unrealized loss position 
of this group  securities representing approximately in unrealized losses have been in an unrealized loss position for less than twelve months 
of the remaining securities in an unrealized loss position for longer than twelve months totaling  management believes they will recover the cost basis of these securities  and has both the intent and ability to hold the securities until they mature or recover in value 
all securities are monitored by portfolio managers who consider many factors such as an issuer s degree of financial flexibility  management competence and industry fundamentals in evaluating whether the decline in fair value is temporary 
in addition  management considers whether it is probable that all contract terms of the security will be satisfied and whether item continued the unrealized loss position is due to changes in the interest rate environment 
should management subsequently conclude the decline in fair value is other than temporary  the book value of the security is written down to fair value with the realized loss recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
the amortized cost and estimated fair value of fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale and held to maturity with an unrealized loss position at december   by contractual maturity  are shown below

agent relationships asset the corporation maintains an identifiable intangible asset referred to as agent relationships 
see the critical accounting policies section of this md a on page for additional information 
in  the before tax amortization and impairment costs related to this asset were compared with in and in at december   the largest individual agent asset carrying value was  which represents the maximum future impairment charge for an individual agent  compared to at december  based upon historical performance of this agent  it is unlikely the agent will become impaired or cancelled in the near term 
for the approximately individual agents remaining that represent the total agent relationships intangible asset  the average asset carrying value as of december   was which compares to approximately agents with an average asset carrying value of at december  the larger than usual impairment charge in was due primarily to the recognition that certain agents experienced sustained premium revenue trends that were significantly different from prior estimates  resulting in changes in estimated future cash flows for those agents 
internally developed software the group has introduced into production  for certain lines of business  an internally developed software application for issuing and maintaining insurance policies named paris sm  a policy administration  rating and issuance system 
during and  the group capitalized application development costs associated with the personal lines segment  which is expected to begin rollout in in addition  in december  the group began rollout for the specialty lines segment 
the specialty lines segment rollout is expected to continue throughout during  the group substantially completed the rollout for the commercial lines operating segment 
a rollout begins when the application has been placed into service for one or more states for an individual major product line and ends when the application is placed into service for the final state 
the rollout period can exceed one year for an individual major product line 
the group capitalizes costs incurred during the application development stage  primarily relating to payroll and payroll related costs for employees  item continued along with costs incurred for external consultants who are directly associated with the internal use software project 
the cost associated with this application is amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of ten years from the date placed into service with before tax amortization expense of  and for  and  respectively 
capitalized internally developed software costs including paris sm and other internally developed software and accumulated amortization are summarized in the table below cost accumulated amortization carrying value for additional information relative to the internally developed software  see the critical accounting policies section of this md a on page all lines discussion statutory results management uses statutory financial data to analyze the group s property and casualty results and insurance industry regulators require the group to report statutory financial measures 
management analyzes statutory results of operations through the use of insurance industry financial measures including statutory loss and lae ratios  statutory underwriting expense ratio  statutory combined ratio  net premiums written and net premiums earned 
the statutory combined ratio is a commonly used gauge of underwriting performance measuring the percentage of premium dollars used to pay insurance losses and related expenses 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss  lae and underwriting expense ratios 
all references to combined ratio or its components in the md a are calculated on a statutory accounting basis and are calculated on a calendar year basis unless specified as calculated on an accident year basis 
a discussion of the differences between statutory accounting and generally accepted accounting principles in the united states is included in item  notes to consolidated financial statements  footnote on page of this annual report on form k 
insurance industry financial measures are included in the next several sections of this md a that discuss results of operations 
statutory surplus  a financial measure that is required by insurance regulators and used to monitor financial strength  is discussed in the statutory surplus section of the liquidity and capital resources section on page of this md a 
premium revenue results premium revenue reflects premiums earned by the group 
the group s premiums are earned principally on a monthly pro rata basis over the term of the policy 
management analyzes premium revenues primarily by premiums written in the current period 
net premiums written differ from gross premiums written by premiums ceded to reinsurers 
the table below summarizes property and casualty premiums on a gross and net basis compared with the same period of the prior year for  and  respectively chg chg december  vs

gross premiums written commercial lines specialty lines personal lines all lines    item continued chg chg december  vs 
vs 
net premiums written commercial lines specialty lines personal lines all lines    statutory net premiums written increased in to  the increase in statutory net premiums written over reflects the group s improved retention ratios and price increases 
net premiums written for include negative impacts for higher reinsurance costs and lower new business production 
net premiums written totaled  in and  in the slight decline of net premiums written in when compared to is primarily attributable to the group s withdrawal from select markets and implementation of stricter underwriting guidelines  including the non renewal of certain construction defect related risks 
in addition  the decline in net premiums written from to reflects the impact of higher reinsurance costs 
the group s business is geographically concentrated in the mid west and mid atlantic regions 
the following table shows consolidated net premiums written for the group s five largest states for each of the last three years all lines net premiums written distributed by top states new jersey pennsylvania ohio kentucky illinois new jersey remains the group s largest state  with of the total net premiums written during  even after the group ceased writing in the new jersey private passenger auto and personal umbrella markets in early the group continues to underwrite other product lines in the new jersey market 
commercial lines gross and net premiums written increased in and  a result of policy renewal rate increases as new business gross written premium has remained relatively flat 
renewal pricing increased during  and  but the rate of increase slowed as the commercial lines segment approached price adequacy and competitive pricing pressures in the marketplace have increased 
the average renewal price increase was for commercial lines direct premiums written  compared with and average renewal price increases in and  respectively 
specialty lines gross and net premiums written decreased in  a result of lower new business production and higher reinsurance costs in the commercial umbrella product line partially offset by growth in the fidelity and surety product line 
net premiums written for the commercial umbrella product line decreased or in to  compared with in and in fidelity and surety net premiums written increased to million  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
stricter underwriting guidelines for certain classes of business and market prices falling below what the group believes are acceptable levels  contributed to the decline in new business production for the commercial umbrella product line 
the net premiums written decline from to was impacted by higher reinsurance costs  including the addition of a ceding commission and increased reinsurance rates per dollar of premium 
the addition of ceding commissions on the and reinsurance contracts causes a corresponding increase to ceded premiums 
average renewal price increases for the commercial umbrella product line were  compared to in and in when used in this report  renewal price increase means the average increase in premium for policies renewed by the group 
the average increase in premiums for each renewed policy is calculated by comparing the total expiring premium for the policy with the total renewal premium for the same policy 
renewal price increases include  among other things  the effects of rate increases and changes in the underlying insured exposures of the policy 
only policies issued by the group in the previous policy term with the same policy identification codes are included 
therefore  renewal price increases do not include changes in premiums for newly issued policies and business assumed through reinsurance agreements  including great american business not yet issued in the group s systems in renewal price increases also do not reflect the cost of any reinsurance purchased on the policies issued 
item continued personal lines gross premiums written remained relatively flat during and net premiums written increased both gross and net premiums written were reduced in due to a refund of escrowed premiums for north carolina personal auto of the personal auto including personal umbrella product line net premiums written decreased to in compared to and in and  respectively 
the decrease in personal lines gross and net premiums written from to is driven by the withdrawal from new jersey private passenger auto  which began in  and the group s continued effort to narrow the geographic focus for personal lines products 
the following table provides key financial measures for all lines for each of the last three years december all lines loss ratio loss adjustment expense ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio the all lines combined ratio improved points driven by a point improvement in the loss and lae ratios 
the loss and lae ratio was impacted by favorable prior year reserve development of in compared to adverse reserve development of in  which reduced the loss and lae ratio by points and increased the loss and lae ratio by points 
the remaining improvement of points in the loss and lae ratio over was due to improved price adequacy  more disciplined underwriting standards and improved claims efficiency 
the underwriting expense ratio improved points as a result of operational efficiencies implemented throughout and  somewhat offset by  or points of expense related to the proformance surplus guarantee 
the all lines combined ratio improved points in compared to with an improved underwriting expense ratio as well as lower loss and lae ratios each contributing to the improvement 
the all lines combined ratio was impacted by of adverse prior year reserve development  a reduction from the combined ratio benefited from a reduction in personnel and sales related expenses  somewhat offset by increased expenses for technology including amortization of internally developed software 
the loss and lae ratio components of the accident year combined ratio measure losses and lae arising from insured events that occurred in the respective accident year 
the current accident year excludes losses and lae for insured events that occurred in prior accident years 
the table below summarizes the impact of changes in provision for all prior accident year losses and lae for each of the last three years statutory net liabilities  beginning of period    increase in provision for prior accident year claims increase in provision for prior accident year claims as of premiums earned in  the impact of the favorable development for prior accident years losses and lae was concentrated in the commercial and specialty lines operating segments 
in  the specialty lines segment experienced significant favorable development for prior years losses and lae  primarily due to a reduction in estimated future costs for claims adjuster related expenses 
the total provision reduction for prior years losses and lae of before tax represents of loss and lae reserves as of year end during  the group reported adverse development of for prior years losses and lae  representing of loss and lae reserves as of year end this adverse development was concentrated in the commercial and personal lines operating segments 
item continued the comparable amount of adverse development for prior years losses and lae recognized during was before tax 
this represents of loss and lae reserves as of year end the adverse development was concentrated in the commercial lines operating segment 
the combined ratio includes a reallocation of lae reserve estimates related to claims adjuster salaries  benefits and similar costs from the commercial and specialty lines segments  to the personal lines segment 
this increased the personal lines segment combined ratio by points and decreased the commercial and specialty lines segments combined ratios by and points  respectively 
catastrophe losses in  and were  and  respectively 
the group was impacted by separate catastrophes in  compared with catastrophes in and in the group uses the serial number assigned by property claims services  a unit of the insurance services office  to define and track losses for specific catastrophes 
property claims services defines catastrophes as industry events that cause or more in direct insured losses to property 
the effects of future catastrophes on the corporation s results cannot be accurately predicted 
as such  severe weather patterns  acts of war or terrorist activities could have a material adverse impact on the corporation s results  reinsurance pricing and availability of reinsurance 
catastrophe losses  net of reinsurance  for each of the last three years were catastrophe losses before tax dollar impact statutory combined ratio impact the seven year historical catastrophe impact on the loss ratio compared to actual for all lines of business was loss ratio point impact q q q q annual historical average actual the underwriting expense ratio  which measures underwriting expenses as a percentage of net premiums written  decreased by points in the underwriting expense ratio was favorably impacted by a reduction in employee related costs  a non recurring reduction in assessments  fees and premium taxes and by other operating efficiencies 
these improvements were partially offset by points of expense related to the proformance surplus guarantee  previously discussed 
the employee count continued to decline in with an approximate reduction from as a result of the cse initiative 
the employee count was   and  as of december   and  respectively 
the underwriting expense ratio was favorably impacted by a reduction in employee related costs and lower sales related expenses as a percentage of premiums  and was partially offset by higher expenses related to investments in technology 
sales related expenses for included the resumption of a ceding commission for certain layers of commercial umbrella reinsurance and agent bonus commission levels which were higher than the year underwriting expense ratio experienced upward pressure due to two factors with a total impact of approximately points 
these two factors were the non renewal of the new jersey private passenger auto business  which had lower commission rates and lower variable processing costs than most other business and the elimination of ceding commissions on umbrella premiums ceded to reinsurers  which had reduced expenses in previous years 
the commission expense ratio  a component of the underwriting expense ratio  was at a relatively high level due to higher than expected umbrella net premiums written  which had a relatively high commission rate on a net of reinsurance basis and to higher than expected accruals for agent bonus commissions 
item continued the  and statutory underwriting expenses also included  and of software amortization expense before tax  respectively  related to the rollout of paris sm 
on a statutory accounting basis  the new application is being amortized over a five year period compared to ten year period under gaap in accordance with statutory accounting principles 
the additional amortization expense is expected to be offset in part by reduced labor costs related to underwriting and policy processing 
in  the group introduced into operation  after more than three years of development  the policy administration rating and issuance system paris sm for commercial lines 
at the end of  paris sm was deployed for the specialty lines commercial umbrella excess capacity product line 
further implementation for other specialty and personal lines products is expected during and the paris sm system provides the policy administration environment used internally by the group s associates 
an extension of paris sm called paris express sm leverages the paris sm system to provide functionality to our agents 
paris express sm is a proprietary internet interface that uses the paris sm system to provide real time functionality through a web browser to our agents 
in addition  the group is simultaneously introducing paris connect sm which allows agents to transact with the group directly from their agency management system 
for commercial lines  paris express sm and paris connect sm currently provide agents with on line quoting capability 
in february of paris express sm was extended to support issuance and endorsement processing for selected pilot agents  nationwide roll out is expected during personal lines currently offers on line and real time quoting and issuance for new business and endorsements through existing non paris sm systems 
agents want a cost effective  timely and simple system for issuing and maintaining insurance policies 
paris express sm and paris connect sm are the cornerstone in the group s strategy of focusing on superior agent service 
the success of this strategic plan depends in part on the ability to provide agents with the technological advantages of these tools 
if they do not work as expected  or fail to satisfy agents needs  the group may lose business to insurers with preferred technologies 
segment discussion the corporation is organized around three business units commercial  specialty and personal lines 
these business units represent the corporation s operating segments as well as its reportable segments 
within each operating segment are distinct insurance product lines that generate revenues by selling a variety of commercial  surety and personal insurance products 
the commercial lines operating segment sells commercial multiple peril  commercial auto  general liability and workers compensation insurance as its primary products 
the specialty lines operating segment sells commercial umbrella  excess insurance and fidelity and surety insurance as its primary products 
the personal lines operating segment sells personal automobile and homeowners insurance as its primary products 
the corporation also has an all other segment  which derives its revenue from investment income 
the following table provides key financial measures for each of the property and casualty reportable segments and product lines item continued statutory earned premium and combined ratios combined ratios accident accident accident by operating segment  including earned year year year selected major product lines premium a a a commercial lines workers compensation commercial auto general liability cmp  fire inland marine specialty lines commercial umbrella fidelity surety personal lines personal auto incl 
personal umbrella personal property total all lines  a the loss and lae ratio component of the accident year combined ratio measures losses and lae arising from insured events that occurred in the respective accident year 
the current accident year excludes losses and lae for insured events that occurred in prior accident years 
accident year as of december  measures insured events for the twelve months of accident year as of december  measures insured events for the twelve months of with remaining related liabilities estimated as of december  accident year as of december  measures insured events for the twelve months of with remaining related liabilities estimated as of december  accident periods may not be comparable due to seasonality  claim reporting and development patterns  claim settlement rates and other factors 
commercial lines segment commercial lines segment loss ratio loss adjustment expense ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio the commercial lines combined ratio for the year decreased points due to a significantly lower loss ratio as a result of improved pricing and underwriting quality in addition to favorable development on prior year reserves 
favorable claim frequency trends  driven in part by underwriting actions  and improved pricing helped to offset the commercial lines claim severity trend 
the combined ratio included points of favorable development on loss and lae reserves from prior years  compared to adverse development of points in on loss and lae reserves from prior years 
the decline in the combined ratio also included a point improvement in the underwriting expense ratio primarily as a result of staff reductions and employee benefit changes 
the combined ratio improved from to by points  in spite of or points of adverse development on loss and lae reserves 
the combined ratio was impacted by or points of adverse prior year development of loss and lae reserves 
of this amount  approximately related to construction defect issues  which added points to the combined ratio for commercial lines results for included higher than expected catastrophe losses which added points to the commercial lines combined ratio in  compared to points and points in and  respectively 
the workers compensation product line combined ratio was in a decline of points compared to in and in although the group has taken actions to improve workers compensation results with higher pricing and a conservative underwriting posture  this product line continues to perform at an item continued unprofitable level 
the current results continue to be negatively impacted by assessments for the national workers compensation pool nwcp residual market 
the impact of the nwcp residual market added points to the workers compensation combined ratio in compared to points in the nwcp residual market lowered the combined ratio by points 
the group s assessments have a larger percentage impact than those reported by the industry due to historical concentration of business in states with inactive pools 
in addition  the concentration of the group s business in a few states with limited pricing flexibility provides less opportunity to address issues specific to the workers compensation product line 
these issues are offset by the group s approach to writing workers compensation as part of an overall commercial lines account  where underwriters look to ensure that the pricing for the entire account is adequate 
the general liability product line combined ratio was in a decline of points compared to in and in this line is exposed to construction defect issues which are being addressed through strict underwriting standards for certain classes of business that are more prone to construction defect claims 
in addition  the group has introduced policy language changes to limit exposure to broadening court interpretations of additional insured and contractual general liability provisions within the policy 
specialty lines segment specialty lines segment loss ratio loss adjustment expense ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio specialty lines combined ratio for increased points 
given the volume and nature of the coverage  the specialty lines combined ratio is subject to more volatility than the other product lines 
the combined ratio included  or points  of favorable development on prior year loss and lae reserves compared to  or points  in and  or points  in the fidelity and surety product lines contributed to the favorable results for this segment 
the fidelity and surety combined ratio increased to in  compared with in and in the fidelity and surety combined ratio included of favorable development on prior accident year loss and lae reserves compared to in and in the fidelity and surety combined ratio also benefited from lower overall losses in both frequency and severity for this product line 
in  there was a return of ceded premium of million before tax for the fidelity and surety business  which lowered the combined ratio by points 
this return of ceded premium was due to the exercise of a contractual option on the bond reinsurance treaty based on highly favorable bond combined ratios over the past fourteen years 
the commercial umbrella combined ratio was compared to and in and  respectively 
the combined ratio included points of favorable development on prior year loss and lae reserves compared to points and points in and  respectively 
the increase in the commercial umbrella combined ratio over is also the result of a reinstatement accrual  which increased the combined ratio by points and a reduction in net premiums written of  putting upward pressure on the combined and component ratios for this product line 
personal lines segment personal lines segment loss ratio loss adjustment expense ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio item continued the personal lines combined ratio for decreased points 
the improvement was partially driven by increased pricing and improved underwriting such as increased deductibles on homeowner s policies 
in addition  adverse prior years reserve development was points in compared to points in and points in offsetting these improvements was the addition of points of expense for the proformance guarantee  as discussed previously 
in  the group completed its withdrawal of personal lines business from florida  georgia and texas 
critical accounting policies management of the corporation has identified the policies listed below as significant accounting policies that are critical to the corporation s business operations and influence the consolidated results of operations and financial performance 
the policies listed below were selected as they require a higher degree of complexity or use subjective judgements or assessments 
changes in these judgements  assessments or estimates could have a material adverse impact on the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
these policies follow accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
a brief summary of each critical accounting policy follows 
management discusses the development and selection of these accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the corporation s md a 
for a complete discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see item  notes to consolidated financial statements  footnote on pages of this annual report on form k 
reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses the group establishes reserves for losses and lae equal to the estimated amount required to settle both reported and incurred but not yet reported ibnr claims 
for each reported claim  a case reserve is established within the parameters of coverage provided in the specific insurance policy 
for ibnr claims  additional loss amounts needed for reported claims and lae  reserves are estimated using generally accepted actuarial methods 
estimates for loss and lae reserves are developed using the facts in each case  the group s experience with similar cases  the effects of current developments and anticipated trends 
the methods and assumptions used in making such estimates are continually reviewed and updated when considered appropriate 
reserves established in prior years are adjusted as loss experience develops and new information becomes available 
adjustments to previously estimated reserves  both positive and negative  are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are made and are referred to as prior period development 
because of the high degree of uncertainty involved in estimating loss and lae reserves  revisions to estimated reserves could have a material impact on the results of operations of the group 
investments all investment securities are classified upon acquisition as either held to maturity or available for sale 
fixed maturity securities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost as management has the ability and positive intent to hold the securities until maturity 
available for sale securities are those securities that would be available to be sold in the future in response to liquidity needs  changes in market interest rates and asset liability management strategies  among others 
available for sale securities are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a component of other comprehensive income  net of deferred tax 
transfers of fixed maturity securities into the held to maturity category from the available for sale category are made at fair value at the date of transfer 
the unrealized holding gain or loss at the date of transfer is retained in other comprehensive income and in the carrying value of the held to maturity securities 
such amounts are amortized over the remaining life of the security 
equity securities are carried at quoted market values and include non redeemable preferred stocks and common stocks 
the difference between cost and quoted market value  net of deferred taxes  is classified as other comprehensive income 
the corporation and the group closely monitor the fixed maturity and equity portfolios for declines in value that are deemed to be other than temporary 
investments are regularly evaluated based on current economic conditions  credit loss experience and other specific developments 
if a decline in a security s fair value is considered to be other than temporary  the security is written down to the estimated fair value with a corresponding realized loss recognized in the current consolidated statement of income 
mortgage backed securities are amortized over a period based on estimated future principal payments  including prepayments 
prepayment assumptions are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect actual prepayments and changes in expectations 
upon receipt of payments from such securities  the appropriate amount of the item continued funds are allocated between a reduction of principal and interest income 
in making this allocation decision  investment personnel consider such factors as the original estimated average life of the investment  the amount of funds received to date and the timing of future cash flows 
variations from prepayment assumptions will affect the life and yield of these securities 
these securities are evaluated for impairment by computing the net present value of expected future cash flows and comparing this to the prior period estimate of expected future cash flows from the security 
when the timing and or amount of cash expected to be received from the security has changed materially and adversely from the previous valuation  the security is considered to be other than temporarily impaired and the amortized cost is written down to the estimated fair value with a realized loss recorded in the current consolidated statement of income 
deferred policy acquisition costs the group establishes a deferred asset for costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring property and casualty insurance business 
the acquisition costs deferred consist principally of commissions  brokerage fees  salaries and benefits and other underwriting expenses to include allocations for inspections  taxes  rent and other expenses that vary directly with the acquisition of insurance contracts 
these costs are amortized over the life of the underlying policies 
quarterly  an analysis of the asset is performed in relation to the expected recognition of revenues including investment income to determine if any deficiency exists 
no deficiencies have been indicated for the periods presented 
agent relationships the agent relationships asset is an identifiable intangible asset representing the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in connection with the gai commercial lines acquisition 
this purchase price was allocated to specifically identifiable intangible assets based on their estimated values as determined by appropriate valuation models 
the agent relationships asset is amortized on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of twenty five years 
the estimated useful life was based on the group s actual experience for agency appointment terms for similar agents  which averaged approximately twenty five years in length 
the estimated useful life is evaluated on an annual basis or as events or circumstances arise that may impact the useful life of the asset 
the asset is evaluated quarterly as events or circumstances  such as cancellation of agents  indicate a possible inability to recover the carrying amount 
cancellation of certain agents for reasons such as lack of revenue production or poor quality of business produced does not necessarily change the estimated useful life of the remaining agents representing the agent relationships intangible asset 
such evaluation is based on various analyses  including cash flow and profitability projections that incorporate  as applicable  the impact on existing company businesses 
the analyses involve significant management judgments to evaluate the capacity of an acquired business to perform within projections 
if future undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized in income in the period in which the future cash flows are identified to be insufficient in comparison to the carrying amount of the asset 
due to the inherent uncertainties and judgements involved in developing assumptions for each agent  further reductions in the valuation of the agent relationships asset are likely to occur in the future 
internally developed software in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use the group capitalizes costs incurred during the application development stage for the development of internal use software 
these costs primarily relate to payroll and payroll related costs for employees along with costs incurred for external consultants who are directly associated with the internal use software project 
costs such as maintenance  training  data conversion  overhead and general and administrative are expensed as incurred 
management believes the expected future value of the asset exceeds the carrying value 
management evaluates the asset on an annual basis for impairment 
the costs associated with the software are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of ten years commencing when the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
pension and postretirement benefit plan actuarial assumptions the company s pension and postretirement benefit obligations  related costs and contributions are calculated using actuarial methods in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards fasb no 
 employers accounting for pensions and fasb  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pension 
these actuarial valuations involve key assumptions including discount rates and expected return on plan assets  which are reviewed by management on a annual basis  or more frequently as needed 
any item continued adjustments to these assumptions are based on considerations of current and future market conditions  which can result in changes to the future related benefit obligations  related costs and contributions incurred by the company 
for additional discussion relative to pension and postretirement benefit plan assumptions  see the section entitled pension and other postretirement benefits of this md a on pages and item  notes to consolidated financial statements  footnote  pages of this annual report on form k

liquidity and capital resources cash flow net cash generated from operations was compared with and in and  respectively 
the increase in net cash for the years and compared to is due primarily to a reduction in paid losses and lae of in and in  a result of the improved loss experience discussed above 
during  the increase in cash was partially offset by an increase in payments to reinsurers for premium cessions  contingent commission bonus payments to agents and the final payments of the replacement carrier fee for new jersey private passenger auto business 
the increase in the reinsurance recoverable asset did not significantly impact cash flow in and since there was a corresponding increase in liabilities for most of the increase in this asset 
the reinsurance recoverable asset at december and  increased and with and due to increases in loss and lae reserves for future loss payments expected to be paid by reinsurers along with other components as shown in item  notes to consolidated financial statements  footnote on page of this annual report on form k 
investing activities used net cash of in  compared to in and in cash used in investing activities increased in due to the net proceeds received from the issuance of the senior notes in june and reinvestment of the cash generated from operations 
cash used in investing activities remained relatively flat in compared to as fewer fixed maturity securities were purchased as prepayments on mortgage backed securities were reduced in  leaving less cash inflow to reinvest 
cash inflows from the sale of property and equipment increased over as the group sold a building located in lexington  kentucky including the related office equipment and land for sales proceeds of total cash generated from financing activities was in  compared to in and cash used of in cash provided by financing activities in resulted from net proceeds of approximately from the issuance of senior notes in june  in addition to the exercise of stock options  partially offset by the repurchase of of the corporation s convertible notes and normal principal payments on the state of ohio loan 
cash provided by financing activities in resulted from the exercise of stock options partially offset by principal payments on the state of ohio loan 
this compares to cash used for financing activities in  which included the repayment of the corporation s credit facility and issuance of the convertible notes with net proceeds of overall  total cash generated in was  compared with net cash used in and of and  respectively 
the corporation did not pay any shareholder dividends for the years presented 
on a regular basis management analyzes the profitability and capital position of the group and the liquidity of the corporation  including the corporation s evaluation of whether to reinstitute a dividend to shareholders of the corporation or a share repurchase program

the corporation may also use the net proceeds to repurchase shares of its common stock in an amount up to the equivalent number of shares issued if holders convert their convertible notes into shares of the corporation s common stock 
the repayment of the convertible notes will reduce the potential for significant future share and earnings dilution 
until the funds are needed for such purposes  the corporation has invested the net proceeds from the senior notes in short term marketable securities 
interest is payable on the convertible notes on march and september and payable on the senior notes on june and december item continued the convertible and senior notes are reported on the consolidated balance sheets net of unamortized issuance related costs and discount of related to the convertible notes and related to the senior notes and all related to the convertible notes at december  and  respectively

the exchange offer is being made pursuant to section a of the securities act of  as amended 
the new notes will have substantially similar terms to the old notes  except that the new notes will include a net share settlement feature and a cash exchange fee payable to the holder of the old notes in an amount equal to of the principal amount of the old notes exchanged 
the net share settlement feature will require the corporation upon conversion to pay cash up to the principal amount of the new notes and pay any conversion consideration in excess of the principal amount in common shares 
the exchange offer will expire at midnight est on march   unless extended or terminated by the corporation 
the corporation plans to redeem all or a portion of the new notes and the old notes  to the extent any remain outstanding  shortly after the completion of this exchange offer 
the corporation intends to use the proceeds of the senior note offering discussed above to accomplish this redemption 
in  prior to the commencement of this exchange offer  the corporation repurchased of the convertible notes in unsolicited negotiated transactions 
the impact of the convertible notes on diluted earnings per share is based upon the if converted method 
in accordance with eitf  all diluted earnings per share amounts have been restated since the issuance of the convertible notes in march see item  notes to consolidated financial statements  footnote on pages and of this annual report on form k for further discussion

as of december   the loan bears a fixed interest rate of  compared to an interest rate of at december  the loan requires annual principal payments of approximately and expires in november the remaining balance at december   was compared to at december  interest expense incurred for the period ending december   and was  and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense incurred during is related to the issuance of the senior notes

following is a summary of the corporation s current ratings and rating outlooks as of december  am best fitch moody s s p financial strength rating a a a bbb senior unsecured debt rating bbb bbb baa bb rating outlook stable stable stable positive generally  credit ratings affect the cost and availability of debt financing 
often  borrowers with investment grade credit ratings can borrow at lower rates than those available to similarly situated companies with ratings that are below investment grade  and the availability of certain debt products may be greater for borrowers with investment grade credit ratings 
currently  the corporation is a split rated borrower  having investment grade ratings from am best  fitch and moody s and below investment grade debt rating from s p 
while influenced by conditions in the credit markets  it is reasonable to anticipate that the corporation s split rating will result in a higher cost of borrowing as compared to borrowers with only investment grade credit ratings 
the recent improvement in the rating outlook by s p is a positive development in the corporation s rating profile 
statutory surplus statutory surplus  a traditional insurance industry measure of financial strength and underwriting capacity  was at december   compared with at december  statutory surplus increased from resulting primarily from statutory net income 
the ratio of net premiums written to statutory surplus is one of the measures used by insurance regulators to gauge the financial strength of an insurance company and indicates the ability of the group to grow by writing additional business 
at december   the group s net premiums written to surplus ratio was to compared to to in the national association of insurance commissioners naic has developed a risk based capital formula for property and casualty and life insurers 
the formula is intended to measure the adequacy of an insurer s capital given the asset and liability structure and product mix of the company 
as of december  and  all insurance companies in the group exceeded the necessary capital requirements 
pension and other postretirement benefits the company sponsors a non contributory defined benefit pension plan and a contributory postretirement healthcare plan 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
key factors include assumptions about the expected rates of return on plan assets  discount rates  rate of compensation increases and health care cost trend rates  as determined by the company  within certain guidelines 
management reviews the assumptions used in the valuations on an annual basis  or more frequently as needed 
the company considers market conditions  including changes in investment returns  interest rates and inflation in making these assumptions 
item continued the company determines the expected long term rate of return on plan assets based on the geometric method  which represents the average compound return of the plan assets 
plan assets are comprised primarily of investments in mutual funds  common stocks  corporate bonds  us government securities  real estate investment trusts and other investments 
the company considers the current level of expected returns on risk free investments  primarily government bonds  the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes  current and expected asset allocation and the expectations for future returns of each asset class when developing the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption 
the expected return for each asset class is weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio 
this resulted in the selection of the assumption for and the expected rate of return on plan assets is a long term assumption and generally does not change annually 
holding all other assumptions constant  a one percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would decrease or increase  respectively  net periodic pension expense by approximately in determining the discount rate assumption  the company utilizes current market information including analysis of the moody s aa corporate bond index rate  analysis provided by plan actuaries and independent survey data on similarly positioned companies 
as regards to the analysis provided by plan actuaries  a discounted cash flow model of the plan s benefit obligations was developed using an interest rate yield curve to make judgments regarding the appropriate discount rate for both its pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations 
the yield curve is comprised of bonds with at least an aa rating with maturities primarily between zero and thirty years 
this resulted in the selection of for and for unrecognized losses of approximately are being recognized over approximately a year period  which represents the average future service period of active participants 
unrecognized gains and losses arise from several factors including experience and assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets 
these unrecognized losses will be systematically recognized as an increase in future net periodic pension expense in accordance with fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
the company expects to contribute approximately to fund the pension plan during the source for the funding will be cash flow from operating activities 
key assumptions used in determining the amount of the obligation and expense recorded for postretirement benefits other than pensions opeb  under fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  including the assumed discount rate and the assumed rate of increases in future health care costs  are reviewed by management on an annual basis  or more frequently as needed 
in estimating the health care cost trend rate  the company considers its actual health care cost experience  future benefit structures  industry trends and advice from its third party actuaries 
the company assumes that the relative increase in health care costs will generally trend downward over the next several years  reflecting assumed increases in efficiency in the health care system and industry wide cost containment initiatives 
at december   the expected rate of increase in future health care costs was for  declining to in and thereafter 
increasing the assumed health care cost trend by one percentage point in each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december   by approximately and increase the postretirement benefit cost for by likewise  decreasing the assumed health care cost trend by one percentage point in each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december   by approximately and decrease the postretirement benefit cost for by the actuarial assumptions used by the company in determining its pension and opeb retirement benefits may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower turnover and retirement rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
while the company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect the company s financial position or results of operations 
item continued in  the company announced changes to its defined benefit retirement plan and defined postretirement health care plans 
the company s traditional defined benefit retirement plan was amended to freeze accrued benefits effective june   and to incorporate a new benefit formula beginning july as a result of this change in the defined benefit retirement plan  the company recognized a reduction in net periodic pension cost of in attributable to the amortization of unrecognized prior service cost and has a remaining unrecognized prior service cost of at december   which will be ratably recognized over the next years as a reduction of net periodic pension cost 
also effective in july  eligibility for subsidized retiree medical and dental coverage was restricted to then current retirees and employees with or more years of continuous service 
other employees are eligible for access to unsubsidized retiree medical and dental coverage 
as a result of this change in the defined postretirement benefit plan  the company recognized a reduction in net periodic postretirement cost of in attributable to the amortization of unrecognized prior service cost and has a remaining unrecognized prior service cost of at december   which will be ratably recognized over the next years as a reduction of net periodic postretirement cost 
for more information on the company s pension and other postretirement benefit plans  please refer to item  notes to consolidated financial statements  footnote on pages of this annual report on form k 
loss and loss adjustment expenses the group s largest liabilities are reserves for losses and lae 
loss and lae reserves are established for all incurred claims without discounting for the time value of money and before credit for reinsurance recoverable 
actual losses and lae are adjusted upward or downward as new information is received 
these reserves amounted to billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
as of december   the reserves by operating segment were as follows billion commercial lines  billion specialty lines and billion personal lines 
the group s actuaries conduct a reserve study using generally accepted actuarial methods each quarter from which point estimates of ultimate losses and lae by product line or coverage within product line are selected 
in selecting the point estimates  thousands of data points are reviewed and the judgment of the actuaries is applied broadly 
each quarter management records its best estimate of the liability for loss and lae reserves by considering the actuaries point estimates 
management s best estimate recognizes that there is uncertainty underlying the actuarial point estimates 
estimating the ultimate cost of claims is a complex process 
this estimation process is based largely on the assumption that actuarial reserving methods  using historical loss experience and applied by experienced reserving actuaries  produces reasonable estimates of future losses on prior insured events 
reserve estimates can change over time because of unexpected changes in the internal and or external environment 
assumptions internal to company operations include recording of premium and loss statistics in the appropriate detail is accurate and consistent  claims handling  including the recording of claims  payment and closure rates  and case reserving is consistent  the quality of business written and the mix of business eg states  limits  coverages and deductibles have been consistent  rate changes and changes in policy provisions have been measured accurately  reinsurance coverage has been consistent and reinsured losses are collectible 
assumptions related to the external environment include tort law and the legal environment have been and remain consistent  coverage interpretation by the courts has been and remains consistent  regulations regarding coverage provisions have been consistent  and loss inflation is relatively stable 
to the extent any of the above factors have changed over time  attempts are made to adjust for the changes 
the following example is presented to illustrate the sensitivity of loss estimates to a change in the stable loss inflation assumption 
the impact of an unexpected increase in loss inflation was determined by deriving expected payment patterns for each major product line and applying these patterns to the december   loss and lae reserves to generate estimated annual payments for each subsequent calendar year 
then  an explicit annual incremental inflationary trend of one percent was applied to the annual payments  and revised loss and lae payments were calculated 
the estimated cumulative impact that this additional unexpected one percent increase in the inflationary trend would have on our results over the lifetime of the underlying claims is shown below 
item continued product line before tax income reduction homeowners personal automobile commercial automobile workers compensation commercial multi peril general liability including umbrella this additional unexpected claims inflation trend could arise from a variety of sources such as a general increase in economic inflation  an increase in tort costs  the introduction of higher cost medical technologies and procedures  changes in the utilization of medical procedures  or increased life expectancy 
unexpected changes to other internal and external assumptions could also generate changes to the expected loss and lae payments 
the group has three categories of loss and lae reserves that it considers highly uncertain  and therefore  could have a material impact on future financial results asbestos and environmental liability  construction defect and commercial umbrella exposures 
these categories are described below with relevant historical data 
in recent years  asbestos and environmental liability claims have expanded greatly in the insurance industry 
historically  the group has written small commercial accounts with a focus on contracting business 
within the manufacturing category  the group has concentrated on light manufacturers 
thus the group s exposure to asbestos is related to installers and distributors as opposed to the large manufacturers 
consequently  the group believes it does not have exposure to the primary defendants involved in major asbestos litigation 
the group s exposure to environmental liability is due to policies written prior to the introduction of the absolute pollution endorsement in the mid s  and to underground storage tanks mostly from new jersey homeowners policies in recent years 
the group has limited exposures to the national priority list  a list of known or threatened releases of hazardous substances  pollutants  or contaminants throughout the united states 
in and  respectively  the group increased loss and lae reserves by and for environmental claims 
in  the group re classified approximately of homeowners reserves related to underground storage tanks as environmental reserves 
for and  respectively  the asbestos and environmental reserves  prior to the impact of reinsurance  were and asbestos reserves were and  and environmental reserves were and for and  respectively 
the group defines construction defect exposure as liability for allegations of defective work and completed operations losses from general liability  commercial multiple peril liability and umbrella liability policies involving multiple units condos townhouses apartments tracts of single family homes  multiple defendants eg developers  sub contractors  usually with multiple defect issues  and often involving multiple insurance carriers 
the group excludes from the definition  claims related to individual single family homes  apartments townhomes or other residential properties if the defect issues are limited in scope and volume 
the number of construction defect claims reported in  and were  and  respectively 
paid losses  net of reinsurance  in were  compared to in and in paid claims legal related lae  net of reinsurance  for construction defect claims were in  compared with in and in these totals exclude construction defect losses from the state of california 
although the group has construction defect losses from california exposure  it excludes california from this data because the group stopped writing in the state in and the remaining claims are minimal 
the group writes commercial umbrella business with large policy limits that are heavily reinsured 
the period of time between the loss occurrence  the reporting of the claim to the insurer  and the settlement of the claim can be substantial 
the large policy limits coupled with this lengthy time period increase the uncertainty of loss estimates before the application of reinsurance 
for and loss and lae reserves prior to reinsurance were and  respectively 
for losses occurring in  reinsurance purchased by the group limits item continued its retention of losses to of the first  of excess of and of excess of the reinsurance purchased in and was comparable to that purchased in for and loss and lae reserves net of reinsurance were and  respectively 
results for the year were favorably impacted by losses and lae incurred for prior accident years totaling before tax on an all lines basis 
this amount and those stated below are net of reinsurance  including change in the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables 
losses and lae incurred for prior accident years were recognized during the year due to new information that caused a revision to prior estimates for loss and lae reserves 
the following table provides the before tax amount of prior accident year loss and lae reserve development by reportable segment favorable unfavorable commercial lines specialty lines personal lines total prior accident years development for the commercial lines operating segment  the favorable loss and lae development for prior accident years recorded during was concentrated in the commercial automobile product line 
in  the adverse development was concentrated in the general liability  commercial multi peril and workers compensation product lines 
in  the adverse development was concentrated in the general liability product line  and was heavily impacted by construction defect losses 
commercial automobile and workers compensation also contributed to the adverse development 
for the specialty lines operating segment  the favorable loss and lae development for prior accident years recorded during was concentrated in the commercial umbrella and bonds product lines 
in  the favorable development was concentrated in the commercial umbrella product line 
for the personal lines operating segment  the adverse loss and lae development for prior accident years recorded during  and was concentrated in the personal automobile including personal umbrella product line 
the following table provides prior year development for loss and lae by accident year accident year accident year accident year accident year accident year prior total prior accident years development the amount of statutory loss and lae reserves by accident year at the beginning of was for accident year  for accident year and  for accident year and prior 
in the opinion of management  the reserves recorded at december   represent the group s best estimate of its ultimate liability for losses and lae 
however  due to the inherent complexity of the estimation process and the potential variability of the assumptions used  final claim settlements may vary significantly from the amounts recorded 
furthermore  the timing  frequency and extent of adjustments to the estimated liabilities cannot be predicted since conditions and events which established historical loss and lae reserve development and which serve as the basis for estimating ultimate claim costs may not occur in exactly the same manner  if at all 
item continued reinsurance programs the group maintains several programs that provide reinsurance coverage 
the programs in effect for and key changes in these programs for are summarized below 
the group s property per risk program covers property losses in excess of for a single insured  for a single event 
this property per risk program covers up to in losses in excess of the retention level for a single event 
the retention on the property per risk excess of loss treaty increased to in the group s casualty per occurrence program covers liability losses 
for  workers compensation  umbrella and other casualty reinsurance cover losses up to  and  respectively  in excess of the retention level for a single insured event 
the casualty reinsurance treaty includes a layer of coverage of in excess of that consists of a reinsurance treaty fund managed by the group  and the group has title to the assets held in this fund 
ceded premiums are paid by the group into the reinsurance treaty fund and reinsured losses are paid to the group under the terms of the reinsurance agreement with various reinsurers 
the reinsurers bear the risk of losses in excess of the assets held in the reinsurance treaty fund 
the group s ability to manage the investments of the fund reduces credit risk related to reinsurers 
the balance of the reinsurance treaty fund as of december   was approximately for  the casualty layer excess of retention was replaced by two treaties 
for casualty other than commercial umbrella  a layer excess of retention was purchased  the group retains of the layer 
for commercial umbrella  a layer excess of retention was purchased  the group retains and of the layer for supported and unsupported policies  respectively 
the property catastrophe reinsurance program protects the group against an accumulation of losses arising from one defined catastrophic occurrence or series of events 
the program provided of coverage in excess of the group s retention level 
the catastrophe excess of loss treaty changed to in excess of for over the last years  only two events triggered coverage under the catastrophe reinsurance program 
both of these losses exceeded the prior retention amount of  resulting in significant recoveries from reinsurers 
reinsurance limits are purchased to cover exposure to catastrophic events having the probability of occurring approximately every years 
gai agreed to maintain reinsurance on the commercial lines business that the group acquired from gai and its affiliates in for loss dates prior to december  gai is obligated to reimburse the group if gai s reinsurers are unable to pay claims with respect to the acquired commercial lines business 
reinsurance contracts do not relieve the group of their obligations to policyholders 
the collectibility of reinsurance depends on the solvency of the reinsurers at the time any claims are presented 
the group monitors each reinsurer s financial health and claims settlement performance because reinsurance protection is an important component of the corporation s financial plan 
each year  the group reviews financial statements and calculates various ratios used to identify reinsurers who no longer meet appropriate standards of financial strength 
reinsurers who fail these tests are reviewed and those that are determined by the group to have insufficient financial strength are removed from the program at renewal 
additionally  a large base of reinsurers is utilized to mitigate concentration of risk 
the group also records an estimated allowance for uncollectible reinsurance amounts as deemed necessary 
during the last three fiscal years  no reinsurer accounted for more than percent of total ceded premiums 
as a result of these measures  amounts of uncollectible reinsurance have not been significant

during  the corporation and group  as a result of improved profitability  changed its investment strategy to increase its investment into tax exempt securities 
the consolidated fixed maturity portfolio  including short term securities  has an intermediate duration and a laddered maturity structure 
the duration of the fixed maturity portfolio was approximately and years as of december  and  respectively 
the corporation and the group remain fully invested and do not time markets 
item continued fixed maturity securities are classified as investment grade or non investment grade based upon the higher of the ratings provided by s p and moody s 
when a security is not rated by either s p or moody s  the classification is based on other rating services  including the securities valuation office of the national association of insurance commissioners 
the market value of available for sale split rated fixed maturity securities ie  those having an investment grade rating from one rating agency and a below investment grade rating from another rating agency was and at december  and  respectively 
investments in below investment grade securities have greater risks than investments in investment grade securities 
the risk of default by borrowers that issue below investment grade securities is significantly greater because these borrowers are often highly leveraged and more sensitive to adverse economic conditions  including a recession or a sharp increase in interest rates 
additionally  investments in below investment grade securities are generally unsecured and subordinate to other debt 
investment grade securities are also subject to significant risks  including additional leveraging  changes in control of the issuer or worse than previously expected operating results 
in most instances  investors are unprotected with respect to these risks  the negative effects of which can be substantial

equity securities are carried at fair market value on the consolidated balance sheets 
as a result  shareholders equity and statutory surplus fluctuate with changes in the value of the equity portfolio 
as of december   the equity portfolio consisted of stocks in a total of separate entities in different industries 
of this total  was invested in five companies and the largest single position was of the equity portfolio 
at december   the equity portfolio consisted of stocks in separate entities in different industries 
of this total  was invested in five companies and the largest single position was of the equity portfolio 
in june  the corporation invested the proceeds of the june senior note offering in short term instruments 
short term investments are carried at fair market value on the consolidated balance sheets and produce a lower yield 
the investment portfolio also includes non publicly traded securities such as private placements  non exchange traded equities and limited partnerships which are carried at fair value 
fair values are based on valuations from pricing services  brokers and other methods as determined by management to provide the most accurate price 
the carrying value of this portfolio at december   was compared to at december  the corporation and group use assumptions and estimates when valuing certain investments and related income 
these assumptions include estimations of cash flows and interest rates 
although the corporation and group believe the values of its investments represent fair value  certain estimates could change and lead to changes in fair values due to the inherent uncertainties and judgements involved with accounting measurements
