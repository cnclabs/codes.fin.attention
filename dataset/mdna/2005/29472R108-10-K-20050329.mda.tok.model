item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financing activities 
property expansions several of our properties have available land for expanding the number of sites available to be utilized by our customers 
development of these sites expansion sites is predicated by local market conditions and permitted by zoning and other applicable laws 
when justified  development of expansion sites allows us to leverage existing facilities and amenities to increase the income generated from the properties 
where appropriate  facilities and amenities may be upgraded or added to certain properties to make those properties more attractive in their markets 
our acquisition philosophy has included the desire to own properties with potential expansion site development  and we have been successful in acquiring a number of such properties 
examples of these properties include the acquisition of the heritage with potential development of approximately expansion sites  the acquisition of bulow plantation with potential development of approximately expansion sites  the acquisition of golf vista estates with potential development of approximately expansion sites  the acquisition of coquina crossing with potential development of approximately expansion sites  and the acquisitions of grand island and the lakes at countrywood with combined potential development of approximately expansion sites 
in we acquired several properties with potential expansion sites  including o connell s with approximately expansion sites  monte vista with expansion sites and viewpoint with expansion sites 
in addition  included in the purchase of the thousand trails properties are  acres available for expansion 
approximately of our properties have expansion potential 
in  we expect to commence development of approximately expansion sites within five of these properties 
as of december   we had approximately expansion sites available for occupancy in of the properties 
we filled expansion sites in and expect to fill an additional expansion sites in leases at our properties  a typical lease entered into between the customer and the company for the rental of a site is for a month to month or year to year term  renewable upon the consent of both parties or  in some instances  as provided by statute 
these leases are cancelable  depending on applicable law  for non payment of rent  violation of property rules and regulations or other specified defaults 
non cancelable long term leases  with remaining terms ranging up to ten years  are in effect at certain sites within of the properties 
some of these leases are subject to rental rate increases based on the consumer price index cpi  in some instances taking into consideration certain floors and ceilings and allowing for pass throughs of certain items such as real estate taxes  utility expenses and capital expenditures 
generally  market rate adjustments are made on an annual basis 
at resort oriented properties  many annual and seasonal customers generally prepay for their stay 
many resort customers will also leave deposits to reserve a site for the following year 
regulations and insurance general 
our properties are subject to various laws  ordinances and regulations  including regulations relating to recreational facilities such as swimming pools  clubhouses and other common areas 
we believe that each property has the necessary permits and approvals to operate 
rent control legislation 
at certain of our properties  state and local rent control laws  principally in california  limit our ability to increase rents and to recover increases in operating expenses and the costs of capital improvements 
enactment of such laws has been considered from time to time in other jurisdictions 
we presently expect to continue to maintain properties  and may purchase additional properties  in markets that are either subject to rent control or in which rent limiting legislation exists or may be enacted 
for example  florida has enacted a law that generally provides that rental increases must be reasonable 
also  certain jurisdictions in california in which we own properties limit rent increases to changes in the cpi or some percentage thereof 
as part of our effort to realize the value of our properties subject to restrictive regulation  we have initiated lawsuits against several municipalities imposing such regulation in an attempt to balance the interests of our stockholders with the interests of our customers see item legal proceedings 
insurance 
we believe that the properties are covered by adequate fire  flood  property  earthquake and business interruption insurance where appropriate provided by reputable companies and with commercially reasonable deductibles and limits 
due to the lack of available commercially reasonable coverage  we are self insured for terrorist incidents  except at certain properties where terrorist insurance coverage is required by debt covenants 
we believe our insurance coverage is adequate based on our assessment of the risks to be insured  the probability of loss and the relative cost of available coverage 
we have obtained insurance insuring good title to the properties in an aggregate amount that we believe to be adequate 
approximately florida properties suffered damage from the four hurricanes that struck florida during august and september as of december   total expenditures approximated million 
approximately million has been charged to operations as non recoverable 
the remaining portion is included in other assets as a receivable from insurance providers 
the company expects to incur additional expenditures to complete the work necessary to restore these properties to their pre hurricanes condition 
as of february   approximately million of these claims have been submitted for reimbursement 
industry we believe that modern properties similar to ours provide an opportunity for increased cash flows and appreciation in value 
these may be achieved through increases in occupancy rates and rents  as well as expense controls  expansion of existing properties and opportunistic acquisitions  for the following reasons barriers to entry we believe that the supply of new properties will be constrained due to barriers to entry 
the most significant barrier has been the difficulty of securing zoning from local authorities 
this has been the result of i the public s historically poor perception of manufactured housing  and ii the fact that properties generate less tax revenue because the homes are treated as personal property a benefit to the homeowner rather than real property 
another factor that creates substantial barriers to entry is the length of time between investment in a property s development and the attainment of stabilized occupancy and the generation of revenues 
the initial development of the infrastructure may take up to two or three years 
once a property is ready for occupancy  it may be difficult to attract customers to an empty property 
substantial occupancy levels may take several years to achieve 
industry consolidation according to various industry reports  there are approximately  properties in the united states  and approximately or approximately  of the properties have more than sites and would be considered investment grade 
we believe that this relatively high degree of fragmentation provides us  as a national organization with experienced management and substantial financial resources  the opportunity to purchase additional properties 
customer base we believe that properties tend to achieve and maintain a stable rate of occupancy due to the following factors i customers typically own their own homes  ii properties tend to foster a sense of community as a result of amenities such as clubhouses and recreational and social activities  iii since moving a site set home from one property to another involves substantial cost and effort  customers often sell their home in place similar to site built residential housing with no interruption of rental payments to us 
lifestyle choice according to the recreational vehicle industry association nearly in united states vehicle owning households owns an rv 
the million people born from to or baby boomers make up the fastest growing segment of this market 
we believe that this population segment  seeking an active lifestyle  will provide opportunities for future cash flow growth for the company 
current rv owners  once finished with the more active rv lifestyle  will seek more permanent retirement or vacation establishments 
the site set housing choice has become an increasingly popular housing alternative for retirement  second home  and empty nest living 
according to a fannie mae survey  the baby boom generation will constitute of the us population within the next years and more than million people will reach age within the next ten years 
among those individuals who are nearing retirement age to  approximately plan on moving upon retirement 
we believe that the housing choices in our properties are especially attractive to such individuals throughout this lifestyle cycle 
our properties offer an appealing amenity package  close proximity to local services  social activities  low maintenance and a secure environment 
in fact  many of our properties allow for this cycle to occur within a single property 
construction quality since  all factory built housing has been required to meet stringent federal standards  resulting in significant increases in quality 
the department of housing and urban development s hud standards for site set housing construction quality are the only federally regulated standards governing housing quality of any type in the united states 
site set homes produced since have received a red and silver government seal certifying that they were built in compliance with the federal code 
the code regulates site set home design and construction  strength and durability  fire resistance and energy efficiency  and the installation and performance of heating  plumbing  air conditioning  thermal and electrical systems 
in newer homes  top grade lumber and dry wall materials are common 
also  manufacturers are required to follow the same fire codes as builders of site built structures 
in addition  although resort cottages do not come under the same regulation  many of the manufacturers of site set homes also produce resort cottages with many of the same quality standards 
comparability to site built homes the site set housing industry has experienced a trend towards multi section homes 
many modern site set homes are longer up to feet  compared to feet in the s and wider than earlier models 
many such homes have vaulted ceilings  fireplaces and as many as four bedrooms  and closely resemble single family ranch style site built homes 
second home demographics according to the national association of realtors nar  sales of second homes have risen almost since there were approximately million second homes owned in and approximately of all home sales each year are second homes 
the nar study found that of people who own a second home own either a cabin or site set home 
approximately of vacation home owners prefer to be near an ocean  river or lake  close to mountains or other natural attractions  and in a specific vacation area 
in looking ahead nar believes that baby boomers are still in their peak earning years  and the leading edge of their generation is approaching retirement 
as they continue to have the financial wherewithal to purchase second homes as a vacation property  investment opportunity  or perhaps as a retirement retreat  those baby boomers will continue to drive the market for second homes 
it is likely that over the next decade we will continue to see historically high levels of second home sales

item legal proceedings deanza santa cruz the customers of deanza santa cruz mobile estates  a property located in santa cruz  california  brought several actions opposing fees and charges in connection with water service at the property 
as a result of one action  the company rebated approximately  to the customers 
the deanza santa cruz homeowners association hoa then proceeded to a jury trial alleging these overcharges entitled them to an award of punitive damages 
in january  a jury awarded the hoa million in punitive damages 
on december  the california court of appeal for the sixth district reversed the million punitive damage award  the related award of attorneys fees  and  as a result  all post judgment interest thereon  on the basis that punitive damages are not available as a remedy for a statutory violation of the california mobilehome residency law mrl 
the decision of the appellate court left the hoa  the plaintiff in this matter  with the right to seek a new trial in which it must prove its entitlement to either the statutory penalty and attorneys fees available under the mrl or punitive damages based on causes of action for fraud  misrepresentation or other tort 
in order to resolve this matter  the company accrued for and agreed to pay  to the hoa 
this payment resolved the punitive damages claim 
the hoa s attorney made a motion asking for an award of attorneys fees and costs in the amount of approximately million as a result of this resolution of the litigation 
on april  the court awarded attorney s fees to the hoa s attorney in the amount of  and court costs of approximately  the company appealed this award 
on july   the california court of appeal affirmed the award of attorney s fees in favor of the hoa s attorney 
other california rent control litigation as part of the company s effort to realize the value of its properties subject to rent control  the company has initiated lawsuits against several municipalities in california 
the company s goal is to achieve a level of regulatory fairness in california s rent control jurisdictions  and in particular those jurisdictions that prohibit increasing rents to market upon turnover 
this regulatory feature  called vacancy control  allows tenants to sell their homes for a premium representing the value of the future discounted rent controlled rents 
in the company s view  such regulation results in a transfer of the value of the company s stockholders land  which would otherwise be reflected in market rents  to tenants upon the sales of their homes in the form of an inflated purchase price that cannot be attributed to the value of the home being sold 
as a result  in the company s view  the company loses the value of its asset and the selling tenant leaves the property with a windfall premium 
the company has discovered through the litigation process that certain municipalities considered condemning the company s properties at values well below the value of the underlying land 
in the company s view  a failure to articulate market rents for sites governed by restrictive rent control would put the company at risk for condemnation or eminent domain proceedings based on artificially reduced rents 
such a physical taking  should it occur  could represent substantial lost value to stockholders 
the company is cognizant of the need for affordable housing in the jurisdictions  but asserts that restrictive rent regulation with vacancy control does not promote this purpose because the benefits of such regulation are fully capitalized into the prices of the homes sold 
the company estimates that the annual rent subsidy to tenants in these jurisdictions is approximately million 
in a more well balanced regulatory environment  the company would receive market rents that would eliminate the subsidy and homes would trade at or near their intrinsic value 
in connection with such efforts  the company announced it has entered into a settlement agreement with the city of santa cruz  california and that  pursuant to the settlement agreement  the city amended its rent control ordinance to exempt the company s property from rent control as long as the company offers a long term lease which gives the company the ability to increase rents to market upon turnover and bases annual rent increases on the cpi 
the settlement agreement benefits the company s stockholders by allowing them to receive the value of their investment in this property through vacancy decontrol while preserving annual cpi based rent increases in this age restricted property 
the company has filed two lawsuits in federal court against the city of san rafael  challenging its rent control ordinance on constitutional grounds 
the company believes that one of those lawsuits was settled by the city agreeing to amend the ordinance to permit adjustments to market rent upon turnover 
the city subsequently rejected the settlement agreement 
the court initially found the settlement agreement was binding on the city  but then reconsidered and determined to submit the claim of breach of the settlement agreement to a jury 
in october  the first case against the city went to trial  based on both breach of the settlement agreement and the constitutional claims 
a jury found no breach of the settlement agreement  the company then filed motions asking the court to rule in its favor on that claim  notwithstanding the jury verdict 
the court has postponed decision on those motions and on the constitutional claims  pending a ruling on some property rights issues by the united states supreme court 
in the event that the court does not rule in favor of the company on either the settlement agreement or the constitutional claims  then the company has pending claims seeking a declaration that it can close the property and convert it to another use 
the company s efforts to achieve a balanced regulatory environment incentivize tenant groups to file lawsuits against the company seeking large damage awards 
the homeowners association at contempo marin cmhoa  a site property in san rafael  california  sued the company in december over a prior settlement agreement on a capital expenditure pass through after the company sued the city of san rafael in october alleging its rent control ordinance is unconstitutional 
in the contempo marin case  the cmhoa prevailed on a motion for summary judgment on an issue that permits the company to collect only out of a monthly pass through amount of that the company believes had been agreed to by the cmhoa in a settlement agreement 
on may   the california court of appeal affirmed the trial court s order dismissing the company s claims against the city of san rafael 
the trial court has set a trial date in the second quarter of on the cmhoa s remaining claims for damages 
the company intends to vigorously defend this matter 
the company believes that such lawsuits will be a consequence of the company s efforts to change rent control since tenant groups actively desire to preserve the premium value of their homes in addition to the discounted rents provided by rent control 
the company has determined that its efforts to rebalance the regulatory environment despite the risk of litigation from tenant groups are necessary not only because of the million annual subsidy to tenants  but also because of the condemnation risk 
similarly  in june  the company won a judgment against the city of santee in california superior court case no 

the effect of the judgment was to invalidate  on state law grounds  two rent control ordinances the city of santee had enforced against the company and other property owners 
however  the court allowed the city to continue to enforce a rent control ordinance that predated the two invalid ordinances the prior ordinance 
as a result of the judgment the company was entitled to collect a one time rent increase based upon the difference in annual adjustments between the invalid ordinance s and the prior ordinances and to adjust its base rents to reflect what the company could have charged had the prior ordinance been continually in effect 
the city of santee appealed the judgment 
the court of appeal and california supreme court refused to stay enforcement of these rent adjustments pending appeal 
after the city was unable to obtain a stay  the city and the tenant association each sued the company in separate actions alleging the rent adjustments pursuant to the judgment violate the prior ordinance case nos 
gie and gie 
they seek to rescind the rent adjustments  refunds of amounts paid  and penalties and damages in these separate actions 
on january   the california court of appeal reversed the judgment in part and affirmed it in part with a remand 
the court of appeal affirmed that one ordinance was unlawfully adopted and therefore void and that the second ordinance contained unconstitutional provisions 
however  the court ruled the city had the authority to cure the issues with the first ordinance retroactively 
on remand the trial court is directed to decide the issue of damages to the company which the company believes is consistent with the company receiving the economic benefit of invalidating one of the ordinances and also consistent with the company s position that it is entitled to market rent and not merely a higher amount of regulated rent 
the company will petition the supreme court of california for review of certain aspects of this decision 
the company intends to vigorously defend the two new lawsuits 
in addition  the company has sued the city of santee in federal court alleging all three of the ordinances are unconstitutional under the fifth amendment to the united states constitution because they fail to substantially advance a legitimate state interest 
thus  it is the company s position that the ordinances are subject to invalidation as a matter of law in the federal court action 
separately  the federal district court granted the city s motion for summary judgment in the company s federal court lawsuit 
this decision was based not on the merits  but on procedural grounds  including that the company s claims were moot given its success in the state court case 
the company intends to appeal this ruling and believes the outcome will be affected by the cases currently before the ninth circuit and united states supreme court 
moreover  in july  the ninth circuit court of appeal decided the case of cashman v 
city of cotati  a property owner s challenge to the city s rent control ordinance  and stated that a rent control ordinance that does not on its face provide for a mechanism to prevent the capture of a premium is unconstitutional  as a matter of law  absent sufficient externalities rendering a premium unavailable 
this reasoning supports the legal position the company has put forth in its opposition to rent control in general and vacancy control in particular 
the city of cotati has petitioned the ninth circuit for rehearing and that petition is pending 
in addition  in october  the united states supreme court granted certiorari in state of hawaii vs 
chevron usa  inc  a ninth circuit court of appeal case that upholds the standard that a regulation must substantially advance a legitimate state purpose in order to be constitutionally viable 
the case was argued before the united states supreme court on february  the ultimate outcome of these cases will guide the company s continued efforts to realize the value of its properties which are subject to rent control and the company s efforts to achieve a level of regulatory fairness in rent control jurisdictions 
other the company is involved in various other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
additionally  in the ordinary course of business  the company s operations are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
management believes that all proceedings herein described or referred to  taken together  are not expected to have a material adverse impact on the company

consolidated historical financial information continued on october   we closed mortgage loans collateralized by properties the recap providing total proceeds of approximately million at a weighted average interest rate of and with a weighted average maturity of approximately years 
approximately million of the proceeds were used to repay amounts outstanding on the company s line of credit and term loan 
approximately million was used to pay a special distribution of per share on january  the remaining funds were used for investment purposes in the recap resulted in increased interest and amortization expense and the special distribution resulted in decreased stockholder s equity 
in connection with the million borrowing and subsequent special distribution  on february   the company contributed all of its assets to mhc trust  a newly formed maryland real estate investment trust  including the company s entire partnership interest in the operating partnership 
this restructuring resulted in a step up in the company s tax basis in its assets  generating future depreciation deductions  which in turn will reduce the company s future distribution requirements 
this provides the company with greater financial flexibility and greater growth potential see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this form k 
we believe that the book value of the properties  which reflects the historical costs of such real estate assets less accumulated depreciation  is less than the current market value of the properties 
funds from operations ffo is a non gaap financial measure 
the company believes that ffo  as defined by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  to be an appropriate measure of performance for an equity reit 
while ffo is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance for equity reits  it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by gaap  and it should not be considered as an alternative to these indicators in evaluating liquidity or operating performance 
ffo is defined as net income  computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
the company believes that ffo is helpful to investors as one of several measures of the performance of an equity reit 
the company further believes that by excluding the effect of depreciation  amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical costs and which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance  ffo can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity reits 
investors should review ffo  along with gaap net income and cash flow from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities  when evaluating an equity reit s operating performance 
the company computes ffo in accordance with standards established by nareit  which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than we do 
investors should review ffo  along with gaap net income and cash flow from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities  when evaluating an equity reit s operating performance 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap  nor does it represent cash available to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  determined in accordance with gaap  as an indication of our financial performance  or to cash flow from operating activities  determined in accordance with gaap  as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions

our revenue streams are predominantly derived from customers renting our sites on a long term basis

as a result  the company has restated its consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and to expense the costs of the initiatives in the year in which they were incurred because the previous method of accounting for the costs was determined to be incorrect 
the company had historically classified these costs  primarily legal  in other assets 
to the extent the company s efforts to effectively change the use and operations of the properties were successful  the company capitalized the costs to land improvements as an increase in the established value of the revised project and depreciated them over years 
to the extent these efforts were not successful  the costs would have been expensed 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of this report for a summary of the effects of these changes on the company s consolidated balance sheets as of december  and consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and the accompanying management s discussion and analysis gives effect to these corrections 
the significance of the increase in expenses due to this change is not necessarily determinable in future periods and depend on future rulings of the united states supreme court 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosures 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 we allocate the purchase price of properties we acquire to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values 
in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price  we utilize a number of sources  including independent appraisals that may be available in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other market data 
we also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our due diligence  marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we periodically evaluate our long lived assets  including our investments in real estate  for impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance  market conditions and legal factors 
future events could occur which would cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted 
real estate is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is computed on the straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we use a year estimated life for buildings acquired and structural and land improvements  a ten to fifteen year estimated life for building upgrades and a three to seven year estimated life for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred and significant renovations and improvements that improve the asset and extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life 
however  the useful lives  salvage value  and customary depreciation method used for land improvements and other significant assets may significantly and materially overstate the depreciation of the underlying assets and therefore understate the net income of the company 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r an interpretation of arb the objective of fin r is to provide guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity vie and determine when the assets  liabilities  non controlling interests  and results of operations of a vie need to be included in a company s consolidated financial statements 
a company that holds variable interests in an entity will need to consolidate such entity if the company absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses or receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns if they occur  or both ie  the primary beneficiary 
the company will apply fin r to all types of entity ownership general and limited partnerships and corporate interests 
the company will re evaluate and apply the provisions of fin r to existing entities if certain events occur which warrant re evaluation of such entities 
in addition  the company will apply the provisions of fin r to all new entities in the future 
the company also consolidates entities in which it has a controlling direct or indirect voting interest 
the equity method of accounting is applied to entities in which the company does not have a controlling direct or indirect voting interest  but can exercise influence over the entity with respect to its operations and major decisions 
the cost method is applied when i the investment is minimal typically less than and ii the company s investment is passive 
in applying the provisions of fin r  the company determined that its million investment in preferred equity interests the mezzanine investment in six entities controlled by diversified investments  inc diversified see liquidity and capital resources investing activities is a vie  however  the company concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary 
as such  the adoption of this pronouncement had no effect on the company s financial statements 
the valuation of financial instruments under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments sfas no 
and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments

financing activities net cash used in financing activities reflects the impact of the following equity transactions in order to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  the company must distribute or more of its taxable income excluding capital gains to its stockholders

the company determined that a taxable transaction in connection with the special distribution to stockholders would be in the company s best interests 
this was accomplished by the contribution of the company s interest in the operating partnership to mhc trust in exchange for all the common and preferred stock of mhc trust 
due to the company s tax basis in its interest in the operating partnership  the company recognized million of taxable income as a result of its contribution  as opposed to a nontaxable reduction of the company s tax basis in its interest in the operating partnership 
this restructuring resulted in a step up in the company s tax basis in its assets  generating future depreciation deductions  which in turn will reduce the company s future distribution requirements 
this provides the company with greater financial flexibility and greater growth potential 
the company intends to continue to qualify as a reit under the code  with its assets consisting of interests in mhc trust 
mhc trust  in turn  also intends to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the code and will continue to be the general partner of the operating partnership 
on may   in connection with the restructuring  mhc trust sold cumulative preferred stock to a limited number of unaffiliated investors 
during the twelve months ended december   in connection with acquisitions the company issued million common op units valued at million of which approximately million has been classified as paid in capital

mortgages and credit facilities we have two unsecured lines of credit of million and million which bear interest at a per annum rate of london interbank offered rate libor plus 
throughout the year ended december   the company borrowed million and paid down million on its line of credit 
on november   in connection with the thousand trails transaction  we secured a million three year term loan at libor plus 
in december  we fixed million of this variable debt for one year with a weighted average per annum interest rate of 
during the twelve months ended december   the company assumed mortgage and other debt of approximately million  which was recorded at fair market value with the related premium being amortized over the life of the loan using the effective interest rate 
the company borrowed an additional million of mortgage debt for other acquisitions 
the mortgages bear interest at weighted average rates ranging from to per annum  and mature at various dates through november  in  the company initiated the recap as a result of its belief in the stability of its cash flow from property operations and the attractive financing terms available to borrowers such as the company in the secured debt markets 
in conducting its evaluation of the use of proceeds from the recap  the company s board of directors believed that to the extent no attractive alternative use was available  a distribution to stockholders should occur 
in late  the company identified acquisition targets which would use approximately million of the million in net proceeds resulting from the recap 
in december  the company s board of directors declared a distribution of approximately million per share 
during  the company identified additional acquisitions and has funded such acquisitions primarily with secured and unsecured borrowings 
financing activities continued the recap and subsequent borrowings in connection with acquisitions have significantly increased the company s outstanding debt 
the interest and principal payments required under these debt agreements materially increase the company s future contractual payment obligations 
as of december   the outstanding debt balance was  million 
in future years  the company expects to pay annual interest and principal amortization under current obligations of approximately million not including the impact of scheduled maturities compared to million in in light of these increased cash flow requirements  the company has reduced its annual dividend to common stockholders from approximately million in to approximately million in in addition  the company expects its cash from operations to increase significantly in compared to due to the cash generated by newly acquired properties 
to the extent cash flow from the properties does not meet the company s expectations  the company s board of directors increases the annual dividend significantly  or the company is required to make significant unexpected capital improvements or other payments  the company s financial flexibility and ability to meet scheduled obligations could be negatively impacted 
with respect to maturing debt  the company has staggered the maturities of our long term mortgage debt over an average of approximately years  with no more than million in principal maturities coming due in any single year 
the company believes that it will be able to refinance its maturing debt obligations on a secured or unsecured basis  however  to the extent the company is unable to refinance its debt as it matures  it believes that it will be able to repay such maturing debt from asset sales and or the proceeds from equity issuances 
with respect to any refinancing of maturing debt  the company s future cash flow requirements could be impacted by significant changes in interest rates or other debt terms  including required amortization payments 
in october  we unwound an interest rate swap swap agreement at a cost of approximately million  which is included in interest and related amortization in in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the swap effectively fixed libor on million of our floating rate debt at approximately per annum for the period october through august the terms of the swap required monthly settlements on the same dates interest payments were due on the debt 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the swap was reflected at market value 
on april   we entered into an agreement to refinance and increase the bay indies mortgage  a million note  from approximately million to million

funds from operations funds from operations ffo is a non gaap financial measure 
we believe ffo  as defined by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  to be an appropriate measure of performance for an equity reit 
while ffo is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance for equity reits  it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by gaap  and it should not be considered as an alternative to these indicators in evaluating liquidity or operating performance 
ffo is defined as net income  computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
we believe that ffo is helpful to investors as one of several measures of the performance of an equity reit 
we further believe that by excluding the effect of depreciation  amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical costs and which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance  ffo can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity reits 
investors should review ffo  along with gaap net income and cash flow from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities  when evaluating an equity reit s operating performance 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by nareit  which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than we do 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap  nor does it represent cash available to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  determined in accordance with gaap  as an indication of our financial performance  or to cash flow from operating activities  determined in accordance with gaap  as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our earnings  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent on prevailing market interest rates 
the primary market risk we face is long term indebtedness  which bears interest at fixed and variable rates 
the fair value of our long term debt obligations is affected by changes in market interest rates 
at december   approximately or approximately billion of our outstanding debt had fixed interest rates  which minimizes the market risk until the debt matures 
for each increase in interest rates of or basis points  the fair value of the total outstanding debt would decrease by approximately million 
for each decrease in interest rates of or basis points  the fair value of the total outstanding debt would decrease by approximately million 
at december   approximately or approximately million of our outstanding debt was short term and at variable rates 
earnings are affected by increases and decreases in market interest rates on this debt 
for each increase decrease in interest rates of or basis points  our earnings and cash flows would increase decrease by approximately  annually
