net sales and costs and related assets and liabilities are generally denominated in the functional currencies of the operations  thereby serving to reduce the company s exposure to exchange gains and losses

critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of the accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records allowances for uncollectible customer accounts receivable based on historical experience 
additionally  an allowance is made based on an assessment of specific customers financial condition and liquidity 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
no individual customer represents more than of total accounts receivable 
any increase in allowance will impact operating income during a given period 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  after provisions for excess and obsolete inventory salable at prices below cost 
provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventories are provided based on current assessments about historical experience and future product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
these factors are impacted by market conditions  technology changes  and changes in strategic direction  and require estimates and management judgment that may include elements that are uncertain 
the company evaluates the adequacy of these provisions quarterly 
although the company strives to achieve a balance between market demands and risk of inventory excess or obsolescence  it is possible that  should conditions change  additional provisions may be needed 
any changes in provisions will impact operating income during a given period 
warranty reserves the company provides reserves for the estimated costs of product warranties when revenue is recognized 
the company relies upon historical experience  expectation of future conditions  and its service data to estimate its warranty reserve 
the company continuously monitors these data to ensure that the reserve is sufficient 

warranty expense has historically been with our expectations 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims such costs may include material  labor  and travel costs  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
increases in reserves will impact operating income during the period 
pension obligations the determination of the company s obligation and expense for pension is dependent on the selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts 
assumptions are made about interest rates  expected investment return on plan assets  total turnover rates  and rates of future compensation increases 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal rates and mortality rates to develop their calculations of these amounts 
the company generally reviews these assumptions at the beginning of each fiscal year 
the company is required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
the actuarial assumptions that the company uses may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact on the amount of pension benefits expense the company has recorded or may record 
the discount rate enables the company to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
the company has little latitude in selecting this rate and it must represent the market rate of high quality fixed income investments 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the company considers the current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs 
sfas no 
requires that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage be recognized as current period charges 
further  sfas no 
requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
unallocated overheads must be recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year the company expects that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material effect on the financial statements 
in december  the fasb enacted sfas no 
r  share based payment which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires the measurement of all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our results of operations 
the accounting provisions of sfas no 
r will be adopted by the company beginning on october  using modified prospective application 
the company anticipates that the impact of adoption will reduce earnings per share by approximately per share 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
sfas no 
replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements sfas no 
requires that a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retrospectively with all prior period financial statements presented on the basis of the new accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to do so 
sfas no 
also provides that a correction of an error in previously issued financial statements should be termed a restatement 
the new standard is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors beginning october  the company does not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations
