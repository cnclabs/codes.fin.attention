item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect our results 
we do not intend to update any of these factors or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements  other than as is required under the federal securities laws 
part i item business overview we are a pharmaceutical company focused primarily on products for the treatment of migraine  acute and chronic pain and other pain related indications 
our product development emphasis is on diseases with unmet medical needs where we can improve efficacy  safety and or patient convenience 
since our inception  we have focused our efforts primarily on the development or regulatory approval of pharmaceutical products for the treatment of migraine 
our portfolio currently contains three product candidates in the migraine area  mt  mt and mt we are also exploring the development of product candidates in other acute and chronic pain and pain related therapeutic areas 
we have not obtained regulatory approval for any of our product candidates 
under our mt technology  which refers to our proprietary combinations of a triptan htb d agonist and a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid  we seek to develop product candidates that provide acute migraine therapy by combining the activity of two drugs that act by different mechanisms to reduce the pain and associated symptoms of migraine 
in june  we signed an agreement with glaxosmithkline gsk for the development and commercialization of proprietary combinations of one or more of gsk s triptans and a long acting nsaid for the us market 
the combinations covered by the agreement are among the combinations of our mt technology 
trexima tm is the proposed brand name for the combination of gsk s sumatriptan and naproxen sodium in a single tablet being developed pursuant to our agreement with gsk 
we commenced a phase clinical program for trexima in the second half of we have completed the first of two planned phase pivotal trials  in which trexima demonstrated superiority over the individual components measured by sustained pain free response p 
and  with the exception of the incidence of nausea free at two hours  all other regulatory endpoints were met p 
we expect to complete the second phase pivotal trial in the second quarter of and to submit the new drug application nda for trexima to the us food and drug administration fda in the second half of for mt and mt  our current focus is primarily on the regulatory process 
mt is a combination of metoclopramide hydrochloride and naproxen sodium 
mt is a proprietary formulation of injectable dihydroergotamine mesylate dhe in a pre filled syringe 
in october  we received a not approvable letter from the fda related to our nda for mt  which was submitted in december we are continuing communications with the fda to assess how best to move forward with mt in may  we received a not approvable letter from the fda with respect to our nda for mt we have continued communications with the fda to seek to persuade the fda that the nda for mt should be approved 
we and the fda have agreed to present mt data to an advisory committee of the fda for consideration  with particular emphasis on the potential risk of tardive dyskinesia 
the fda has advised us that the meeting with the advisory committee  which we previously reported had been tentatively scheduled for may  has been postponed due to fda scheduling conflicts 
we do not know when the meeting will be rescheduled  however  we have been informed by the fda that the rescheduled meeting date will be available  in advance  when published in the federal register 
we are also seeking regulatory approval of mt in the united kingdom uk 
we currently have two exploratory programs in pain related therapeutic areas 
in july  we signed an exclusive option agreement with nycomed danmark aps nycomed  under which we may acquire a license to certain rights related to lornoxicam  an nsaid 
we have begun exploratory development work and clinical studies to investigate the development of novel product candidates containing lornoxicam  alone or in combination with other active ingredients  as potential treatments for pain or other indications 
we have also begun exploratory formulation development and clinical studies for a combination of a proton pump inhibitor ppi and an nsaid in a single tablet intended to provide effective control of pain and inflammation with fewer gastrointestinal complications compared to an nsaid taken alone 
we do not currently have commercialization or manufacturing capabilities 
we have entered into collaborations and currently plan to enter into additional collaborations with established pharmaceutical or pharmaceutical services companies to manufacture 
table of contents and commercialize our product candidates once approved 
to date  we have entered into collaborations with gsk  xcel pharmaceuticals inc xcel and nycomed for the development and commercialization of our current migraine product candidates 
in february  valeant pharmaceuticals international valeant reported that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire xcel and on march  reported that the acquisition had been completed 
we have incurred losses attributable to common stockholders of million since our inception and have not generated any revenue from product sales 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
our business strategy our goal is to become a leading pharmaceutical development company focused on developing drugs for the treatment of migraine  acute and chronic pain and other pain related conditions 
the principal elements of our business strategy are to develop and commercialize our portfolio of product candidates 
we expect to focus a substantial portion of our efforts over the next few years on the further development  approval and commercialization of our existing portfolio of product candidates and potential product candidates 
our primary focus in the near term is the clinical development and regulatory approval of trexima 
a key element of our strategy is to establish collaborations with leading corporations to commercialize our product candidates  and we have entered into and expect to continue to enter into such commercialization collaborations 
where appropriate  we may also elect to develop sales and distribution capabilities internally in order to commercialize alone or with a partner one or more of our product candidates 
in certain instances  we may also promote our products in collaboration with other pharmaceutical companies 
build a product pipeline through innovation  in licensing and acquisition 
we intend to build our product pipeline through innovation  in licensing and or acquisition of select proprietary product candidates 
we will focus primarily on developing other products for the treatment of migraine  acute and chronic pain and other pain related conditions with significant commercial potential in which members of our management team have development or other relevant expertise 
these will include novel products that exhibit distinct advantages over currently marketed products  as well as innovative combinations of products in convenient  therapeutically appropriate formulations 
leverage development efforts through strategic outsourcing 
while maintaining overall control of the planning  development and regulatory processes  we seek to enter into strategic outsourcing relationships to develop and manufacture our product candidates in as cost effective a manner as possible 
we have contracted and plan to contract with third parties for product candidate testing  development and manufacturing 
our product candidates and exploratory programs migraine product candidates migraine market overview migraine is characterized by recurring attacks of headache  often associated with visual  auditory or gastrointestinal disturbances 
while the precise mechanism of migraine is unknown  researchers believe migraine attacks are caused by acute inflammation surrounding selected blood vessels in the head 
the average migraine sufferer experiences the first attack during the early teen years  and the attacks generally continue throughout adulthood 
not all migraine attacks are of the same severity 
consequently  various types of oral  intranasal and injectable therapies are used to treat different types of migraine attacks 
many patients use a personal  individually developed  step care approach to treat their attacks 
attacks are often treated initially with simple over the counter analgesics  particularly if the patient is unable to determine if the attack is a migraine or some other type of headache 
if over the counter remedies are unsuccessful  patients often turn to more potent prescription drugs  including narcotics  analgesic narcotic drug combinations and triptans 
triptans are the family of drugs most commonly prescribed for the treatment of migraine attacks 
triptans have demonstrated the ability to treat migraines by constricting blood vessels in the brain 
although triptans can be effective in treating migraine symptoms  they are often associated with significant side effects and other disadvantages that include the occurrence of cardiovascular related events  including chest pain discomfort  throat discomfort and warm cold sensations  the potential for other serious cardiovascular events  including death  difficulty in producing sustained benefits with a single dose in a majority of patients  the occurrence of nausea and dizziness during treatment  and the need for cardiovascular evaluations from physicians before initially prescribing triptans to patients with cardiovascular disease risk factors 

table of contents despite these shortcomings  in  according to ims health s retail and provider perspective  or ims  total triptan sales in the us were approximately billion 
imitrex  marketed by gsk  is the leading triptan product 
there are currently three types of triptan formulations commercially available oral  intranasal and injectable 
according to ims  us sales for imitrex of all three of these formulations totalled approximately billion in an oral triptan is often the physician s first choice as a prescription treatment for migraine pain 
intranasal triptans are often prescribed for patients requiring faster relief than oral drugs can provide or who cannot take oral medications 
for the most severe attacks  patients sometimes use an injectable form of a triptan 
mt trexima our mt technology involves the development of compounds to provide acute migraine therapy by combining the activity of two drugs that act by different mechanisms to reduce the pain and associated symptoms of migraine 
mt technology combines the pharmacologic activity of a triptan ht 
b d 
agonist with that of an nsaid 
we believe that acute migraine can be treated more effectively with targeted and complementary therapies that achieve maximum therapeutic benefit 
in  the fda approved our request to submit an nda for mt as a section b application  under which the fda allows a reduced development program 
an application submitted under section b permits the fda to rely  for approval of an nda  on data not developed by the applicant  including the fda s previous findings of safety and effectiveness for approved drugs 
we believe that the mt nda  for example  will require very little animal pharmacology and toxicology work and fewer phase and phase clinical trials than would be required if the application were not submitted under section b 
this reduced development plan permitted the earlier commencement of phase clinical trials  as discussed in more detail below 
in the uk  the mhra has agreed to accept a similar development program 
the initiation date of the uk clinical program has not yet been determined 
in june  we signed an agreement with gsk for the development and commercialization of proprietary combinations of one or more of gsk s triptans ht 
b d 
agonists and a long acting nsaid in the us the combinations covered by our agreement with gsk are among the combinations of our mt technology 
under our collaboration with gsk  we are developing a proprietary combination of gsk s sumatriptan and naproxen sodium in a single tablet  under the proposed brand name trexima 
prior to our agreement with gsk  in  we completed a patient  phase double blind  placebo controlled  single dose clinical trial in which our mt drug candidate showed statistically significant superiority over placebo and each of its components on the identified primary outcome measure of sustained pain relief 
in addition  mt showed statistically significant superiority over placebo and its components  including an oral triptan  in the two hour pain response and effectiveness over placebo at two hours in the relief of the associated symptoms of migraine 
adverse events occurred in of patients who received the mt treatment and in of patients who received the triptan alone  and the types of events which include the side effects and other disadvantages of triptans identified above under migraine market overview were similar for both types of treatments 
within the group receiving placebo  reported adverse events 
there were no serious adverse events reported in this trial 
we believe that  in all likelihood  the adverse events that will occur from the use of mt  including trexima  in the treatment of migraine will be similar to those reported with the use of the triptans alone 
we filed an investigational new drug application ind  with the fda for trexima in december in may  we met with the fda to discuss the phase clinical program for trexima 
at this meeting  the fda agreed with our proposed phase development plan for trexima 
the design of the phase trials  including the endpoints required to evaluate trexima  is to demonstrate superiority to placebo for relief of pain and the associated symptoms of migraine nausea  photophobia and phonophobia at two hours  we believe that this is the current fda standard for establishing efficacy of migraine products 
additionally  the program is designed to demonstrate that each component makes a contribution to the efficacy of trexima the combination rule that fda requires of all combination products 
the efficacy endpoint is sustained pain free which is defined as moving from moderate or severe pain to no pain at two hours and remaining at no pain through twenty four hours without the use of rescue medicine 
we commenced the first phase clinical study a long term open label safety study in may in the second half of  we began two  patient phase pivotal trials  using a formulation of trexima developed by gsk  designed to determine the effectiveness and safety of trexima for the acute treatment of migraine as well as to satisfy the requirements of the fda s combination rule 
in addition  in the second half of  we initiated two additional phase studies requested by the fda 
gsk is also funding and currently conducting two phase b studies 
in february  we completed the first of two phase pivotal trials  in which trexima demonstrated superiority over the individual components measured by sustained pain free response p 
and  with the exception of the incidence of nausea free at two hours  all other regulatory endpoints were met p 
trexima did reach statistical significance for the nausea endpoint compared to placebo after two hours and maintained superiority through twenty four hours 
all of the active treatments trexima  sumatriptan and naproxen had a similar incidence of nausea at two hours compared to placebo 
we expect to complete the second phase pivotal trial in the second quarter of submission of the nda to the fda is planned for the second half of we cannot reasonably estimate or know the amount or timing of the costs necessary to complete the development of trexima or when  if and to what extent we will receive future cash inflows from trexima 
the additional costs that we may incur include expenses relating to clinical trials and other research and development activities and the cost and timing of activities necessary to obtain regulatory approvals 

table of contents mt mt is intended to provide an alternative to oral triptans for the treatment of migraine pain and its associated symptoms with less risk of cardiovascular side effects compared to the triptans 
oral products are currently the most prevalent form of migraine therapy 
we believe that mt  if approved  could offer migraine sufferers a better alternative to simple oral analgesics  such as aspirin and acetaminophen  in the treatment of migraine 
in addition  because mt will be a specific therapy for migraine  we believe that  if approved  mt could replace the use of stronger analgesics  including prescription narcotic analgesics  in migraine therapy 
according to ims  existing oral migraine prescription products  including oral triptan products  accounted for approximately billion in sales in the us in  of which the imitrex oral dosage form accounted for approximately million 
mt is a proprietary formulation that combines metoclopramide hydrochloride  a commercially available agent that relieves nausea  enhances stomach emptying  and possesses some analgesic activity  and naproxen sodium  a commercially available anti inflammatory and analgesic agent 
mt is designed to release metoclopramide hydrochloride initially  followed by naproxen sodium 
the metoclopramide is intended to accelerate the absorption of naproxen and to reduce nausea  which can be associated with migraine  its analgesic activity supplements that provided by naproxen 
in order to obtain fda approval for mt  we are required to demonstrate its efficacy and safety 
to demonstrate the efficacy of a combination product candidate such as mt  which combines two previously approved component products  we must demonstrate in clinical trials that it is both superior to each of its individual components  and more effective in treating all symptoms of migraine when compared to a placebo 
for mt  this means that we must show that statistically more patients have achieved sustained pain relief  defined as migraine pain relief at two hours that is maintained throughout the next hours without the use of rescue medication  than patients treated with the component products 
to demonstrate efficacy as a migraine product  mt must demonstrate superiority to placebo for relief of nausea  photophobia and phonophobia 
generally  the fda requires two successful clinical trials to demonstrate that the product candidate meets each of these standards for approval 
we have completed a total of two phase clinical trials  six phase clinical trials  and three marketing support phase b studies  involving in total more than  treated patients  more than  of whom have received some form of mt in addition to the required clinical trials  we also completed a six month oral dosing carcinogenicity study in p transgenic mice in we also completed a two year rat carcinogenicity study in adverse events from a long term safety study included drowsiness  diarrhea  abdominal pain  dizziness infection and nervousness 
adverse events commonly observed in the phase trials have included drowsiness  diarrhea  dizziness and dyspepsia 
in july  we submitted an nda to the fda for mt for the acute treatment of migraine 
the nda was accepted for filing by the fda in october in january  we submitted the report of our two year carcinogenicity study in rats that  as agreed with the fda  completed our nda submission 
the data in the carcinogenicity study showed that there were no statistically significant differences in findings between the rats that received the maximally tolerated dose mtd of metoclopramide in combination with naproxen and the rats that received metoclopramide alone at its mtd 
in may  we received a not approvable letter from the fda with respect to our nda for mt in its letter  the fda noted that we had demonstrated unambiguously statistically significant superiority of mt compared to an appropriate control on a valid measure of pain as well as on the three associated migraine symptoms of nausea  photophobia and phonophobia in one study 
however  the fda noted in the not approvable letter that mt did not clearly meet these criteria in a second study 
the fda also cited the apparent lack of superiority of mt over naproxen for sustained pain relief  which was the primary endpoint for the two component studies that were designed to satisfy the fda s combination rule 
we noted in our press release issued on june  that this issue appeared to arise primarily from an apparent difference in understanding between the fda and us as to the appropriate statistical analysis of this endpoint 
additionally  the fda letter mentioned that  based on animal studies  there may be a potential risk of carcinogenicity  presumably due to metoclopramide  one of the components of mt the fda letter also raised  for the first time  an approvability issue concerning the risk of tardive dyskinesia td presented by the use of metoclopramide 
in july  we received minutes from the fda of a meeting between the fda and us held on june  among other things  these minutes stated the view of the fda expressed in that meeting that  assuming 
pozen 
is able to meet the requirements of the combination rule and demonstrate efficacy we could describe the td potential and carcinogenicity findings in labeling 
this statement in the fda minutes is consistent with the views that we had held prior to our receipt of the not approvable letter with respect to how the fda would address safety issues 
following the receipt of these minutes  we requested a type a meeting with the fda s division of neuropharmacological drug products to present our position in response to the issues identified by the fda 
a type a meeting is defined by the fda as a meeting immediately necessary for an otherwise stalled drug development program to proceed 
at the type a meeting held in october  the fda stated that even if it eventually determined that mt meets the efficacy requirements for a combination drug agent  mt may not be approvable if the benefits of the drug do not  in the fda s opinion  outweigh the risks of mt  including the risk of tardive dyskinesia 
as a result of these more recent discussions  the fda and we have agreed to present the mt data to an fda advisory committee for consideration  with particular emphasis on the potential risk of tardive dyskinesia 
the fda has advised us that the meeting with the advisory committee  which we previously reported had been tentatively scheduled for may  has been postponed due to fda scheduling conflicts 
we do not know when the meeting will be rescheduled  however  we have been informed by the fda that the rescheduled meeting date will be available  in advance  when published in the federal register 
the role of an fda advisory committee is to provide independent expert advice and contribute to the quality of the regulatory decision making process 

table of contents the fda is not bound by the advisory committee s recommendations 
we cannot predict the conclusions of the advisory committee or whether the fda will follow any recommendations provided by the advisory committee 
it is possible that the fda may require that we conduct another clinical trial to provide additional evidence that mt meets the requirements of the combination rule or the efficacy standards applicable to mt the fda may also require that we conduct studies or investigations to seek to evaluate any potential risk of tardive dyskinesia with use of mt we cannot estimate the cost or duration of any such trials  studies or investigations or decide whether to conduct such studies or investigations until the results of the meeting with the fda s advisory committee are known and the design of any such study or studies has been determined with the fda 
our phase clinical trials of mt took between three months and eighteen months and involved a direct cost per patient of between  and  the duration and cost of any new trials  study or studies that we may conduct may be different from our prior clinical trials 
no assurance can be given that our efforts to obtain fda approval of mt will be successful 
in october  we submitted a market authorization application maa to the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency mhra in the united kingdom uk for mt for the acute treatment of migraine 
if marketing authorization for mt is unconditionally approved in the uk  we plan to seek approval in selected european countries through the european union mutual recognition procedure 
this procedure allows other european countries to grant national approvals based upon the review and endorsement of the mhra in the uk 
in september  we received a letter of comments relating to the maa from an advisory group to the mhra  the committee on safety of medicines the mhra advisory committee 
the most significant comment in the mhra advisory committee s letter of comments was that we provide additional information supporting the benefits of the combination of metoclopramide hydrochloride and naproxen sodium in mt in march  we submitted our complete response to the concerns identified by the mhra advisory committee and met with the mhra advisory committee in january to answer questions concerning our response 
subsequent to the meeting we were notified in a letter that the mhra advisory committee was prepared to advise the mhra that a marketing authorization could be granted for mt in the uk  provided we supply certain additional information and meet certain conditions  as outlined by the mhra advisory committee 
in february we provided information to the mhra advisory committee which we believe addresses all the conditions set forth in the mhra advisory committee s letter 
although the mhra is not bound by the mhra advisory committee s recommendations  we understand that it typically agrees with the mhra advisory committee s opinions 
we are not currently conducting any clinical trials for mt however  we are continuing to incur pharmaceutical development costs for product stability testing and costs relating to our continuing efforts to seek approval of mt from the fda and from the mhra  and may incur costs for the commercialization of this product if our applications are approved by the fda and in the uk and other countries in the european union 
additionally  under our agreement with nycomed  if we withdraw a regulatory application from any of the countries identified in the agreement  we will be required to pay a withdrawal fee in amounts that range from million to million 
mt the objective of our mt dihydroergotamine mesylate  or dhe injection mg ml development program is to provide a safe  effective and more convenient way to administer injectable dhe  a migraine treatment that has been marketed in the us for over years as a mg ml ampoule 
mt is a proprietary formulation of injectable dhe in a pre filled syringe that is intended to provide long lasting pain relief for patients who require a convenient injectable therapy for severe migraine attacks 
currently  patients unable to take oral migraine medications due to severe nausea and or vomiting may choose to use an injectable form of a triptan or another drug such as dhe 
according to ims  injectable migraine therapeutics represented approximately million in us sales 
we have performed placebo controlled trials designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of mt in the acute treatment of migraine 
we have completed a phase clinical trial  two phase clinical trials  and a marketing support phase b study  involving in total more than  treated patients  more than of whom have received some form of mt dhe is used often in migraine therapy 
its side effect profile  which includes mild nausea that sometimes requires use of an antiemetic  is well known 
adverse events excluding injection site reactions reported in our phase trials included dizziness  drowsiness  diarrhea  nausea and vomiting 
in december  we submitted an nda for mt to the fda 
the nda was accepted for filing by the fda in february in october  we received a not approvable letter from the fda related to our mt nda based on the fda s conclusion that we had not submitted substantial evidence of effectiveness for mt as an acute treatment for migraine 
no clinical safety issues were identified in the letter  nor were any non clinical issues cited as impacting the fda s decision to issue the not approvable letter 
the fda noted that  although mt provided a statistically significant improvement over placebo on the pre defined endpoint of sustained pain relief at hours post dose  as well as relief of pain at two hours post dose  mt failed to achieve statistical significance versus placebo for the relief of all of the ancillary symptoms of migraine at two hours nausea  photophobia and phonophobia 
further  the incidence of nausea  one of the associated symptoms of migraine  was statistically significantly higher following mt treatment versus placebo at two hours 

table of contents in march  we submitted a response to the fda s not approvable letter and were notified in april that the fda considered our response incomplete because it did not include sufficient information responsive to a question regarding the testing procedures in the manufacturing process for mt subsequently  we submitted additional responses to the not approvable letter and requested a type a meeting with the fda s division of neuropharmacological drug products to present our position in response to the issues identified by fda 
the type a meeting was held in december at which time the fda requested additional information 
after providing the required information  a subsequent teleconference was held with the fda in january during which the fda restated its concerns that approval of mt was problematic due to the higher incidence of nausea at two hours following dosing in patients treated with mt compared with placebo 
once we receive written communications from the fda regarding these recent meetings  we will evaluate what future steps are available to us regarding mt we are not currently conducting any clinical trials for mt however  we are continuing to incur pharmaceutical development costs for product stability testing and costs relating to our continuing efforts to seek approval of mt additionally  under our agreement with xcel  if we withdraw the nda for mt for commercial or financial reasons  we will have to pay xcel million 
our exploratory programs lornoxicam program in july  we signed an exclusive option agreement with nycomed  under which we may acquire a license to certain rights related to lornoxicam  an nsaid that is currently marketed outside the united states including europe and japan 
the exclusive option terminates in july we are exploring whether to develop novel product candidates containing lornoxicam  alone or in combination with other active ingredients  as potential treatments for pain or other indications 
in december  we submitted an ind to the fda for lornoxicam oral tablets and  in january  received fda approval to conduct the first human study with this formulation in the united states 
this single site trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of single doses of lornoxicam at three different dose strengths  ibuprofen and placebo in patients undergoing dental surgery for impacted third molars 
the data from this study confirmed the acute safety profile for lornoxicam in these patients and provided preliminary evidence of efficacy in this pain model 
in september  we met with the fda to review the results of this study  to discuss information provided in the ind  and to discuss non clinical issues and potential additional clinical studies 
we committed to provide additional analyses and information requested by the fda following that meeting which would permit conduct of additional clinical trials with lornoxicam in the united states 
we will continue to discuss with the fda the clinical and non clinical study requirements anticipated for approval of lornoxicam product candidates 
in the event that we elect to exercise our option to license lornoxicam  we will be required to pay nycomed additional fees  including a million license fee  regulatory approval milestones and royalties on sales of any products developed using the licensed rights 
we cannot reasonably estimate or know the amount or timing of the costs necessary to continue exploratory development and or complete the development of any lornoxicam product candidates we may seek to develop or when  if and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from any lornoxicam products 
the additional costs that may be incurred include expenses relating to clinical trials and other research and development activities and activities necessary to obtain regulatory approvals 
pn ppi nsaid program we have initiated an exploratory development program that is intended to identify potential product candidates that combine a ppi with an nsaid in a single tablet intended to provide effective control of pain and inflammation with fewer gastrointestinal complications compared to an nsaid taken alone 
we have designated these potential product candidates as our pn suite of potential products 
in late  we requested a pre ind meeting with the fda to discuss two of our exploratory proprietary tablet formulations containing an nsaid and a ppi 
our studies in human volunteers have suggested that such fixed combinations could provide a degree of protection against the development of gastric and or duodenal ulcers in patients who require the daily use of an nsaid drug for arthritis or other chronic inflammatory conditions 
we met with the fda in january and reached agreement on our proposal for studies to demonstrate efficacy of the ppi nsaid combination 
a confirmation of the safety requirements necessary to support the nda  particularly in regard to the cardiovascular safety of the nsaid component  was tabled pending the outcome of an fda advisory committee meeting in february addressing the potential cardiovascular risk of cox selective nsaids and related drugs 
subsequent to the fda s announcement of responses to the advisory committee s recent meeting we will seek confirmation of the safety requirements necessary to support the nda 
a discussion of the costs and expenses associated with our research and development programs appears below in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations expenses related to our product candidates 

table of contents collaborative arrangements we have entered into and plan to continue to enter into collaborations with established pharmaceutical or pharmaceutical services companies to commercialize and manufacture our product candidates 
our existing commercialization collaborations are described below 
glaxosmithkline in june  we signed an agreement with gsk for the development and commercialization of proprietary combinations of a triptan ht 
b d 
agonist and a long acting nsaid 
the combinations covered by the agreement are among the combinations of mt under the terms of the agreement  gsk has exclusive rights in the united states to commercialize all combinations which combine gsk s triptans  including imitrex sumatriptan succinate or amerge naratriptan hydrochloride  with a long acting nsaid 
we are responsible for development of the combination product  while gsk is to provide formulation development and manufacturing 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  we received million in initial payments from gsk following termination of the waiting period under the hart scott rodino notification program and the issuance of a specified patent 
in may  we received a million milestone payment as a result of our commencement of phase clinical trial activities 
additionally  gsk is obligated to make payments to us in an amount up to million upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones relating to an nda and commercialization progress for the first product 
in addition  gsk will pay us sales performance milestones of up to million if certain sales thresholds are achieved 
up to an additional million per product is payable upon achievement of milestones relating to other products 
gsk will also pay us royalties on all sales of marketed products until at least the expiration of the last to expire issued applicable patent august  based upon the scheduled expiration of currently issued patents 
gsk may reduce  but not eliminate  the royalty payable to us if generic competitors attain a pre determined share of the market for the product  or if gsk owes a royalty to one or more third parties for rights it licenses from such third parties to commercialize the product 
the agreement terminates on the date of expiration of all royalty obligations unless earlier terminated by either party for a material breach or by gsk at any time upon ninety days written notice to us for any reason or no reason 
among the contract breaches that would entitle pozen to terminate the agreement is gsk s determination not to further develop the combination product under certain circumstances 
gsk has the right  but not the obligation  to bring  at its own expense  an action for infringement of certain patents by third parties 
if gsk does not bring any such action within a certain time frame  we have the right  at our own expense  to bring the appropriate action 
with regard to certain other patent infringements  we have the sole right to bring an action against the infringing third party 
each party generally has the duty to indemnify the other for damages arising from breaches of each party s representations  warranties and obligations under the agreement  as well as for gross negligence or intentional misconduct 
we also have a duty to indemnify gsk for damages arising from our development and manufacture of mt prior to the effective date of the agreement  and each party must indemnify the other for damages arising from the development and manufacture of any combination product after the effective date 
nycomed danmark aps in june  we signed a license agreement with nycomed for the commercialization of mt in four nordic countries 
under the terms of the agreement  nycomed will have exclusive rights in denmark  sweden  norway and finland to commercialize mt upon its approval in these countries 
upon execution of the agreement  nycomed paid us an upfront fee of million 
we are eligible to receive milestone payments in an aggregate amount of between million and million upon the occurrence and timing of certain regulatory approvals  including the approval of the maa in the uk and in the other countries where nycomed has exclusive rights 
in addition  nycomed is obligated to pay us a specified royalty on all sales of mt  based upon the higher of an agreed percentage of sales on a country by country basis  subject to reduction in the event of generic competition  or an agreed dollar amount per unit sold subject to reduction under certain conditions  until the latter of the expiration of the last to expire issued applicable patent in the particular country or years from first commercial sale 
the scheduled expiration date of the patent that is currently applicable in sweden  finland and denmark is november  there is no applicable patent in norway 
the license agreement will expire on a country by country basis upon the later of a the date of expiration of all royalty obligations in a particular country  which is scheduled for november  in sweden  finland and denmark  and b years after the date of first commercial sale of mt in such country under the agreement 
nycomed has the right to terminate the agreement if we default under the agreement or the maa is not approved by a specified date or is withdrawn 
nycomed can terminate the applicability of the agreement to a particular country if we withdraw the required regulatory application in that country 
if we withdraw a regulatory application in any of the countries identified in the agreement  we will be required to pay a withdrawal fee in amounts that ranges from million to million 
assuming the issues raised in the september maa comment letter discussed above are satisfactorily resolved and we receive unconditional approval of the maa from the mhra  we intend to seek approval of mt in denmark  sweden  norway and finland through the european union mutual recognition procedure 
under the agreement  generally  each party must indemnify the other for damages arising from each party s breach of its representations  warranties and obligations under the agreement 
additionally  nycomed must indemnify us for any claim brought by a third party arising from nycomed s development  manufacture or sale of any products  and we must indemnify nycomed for any claim brought by a third party arising from our development  transportation or manufacture of any products 
furthermore  both parties have a duty to maintain commercially reasonable insurance coverage commensurate with its obligations under the agreement 

table of contents at the same time as we entered into the license agreement with nycomed  we entered into a supply agreement with nycomed under which nycomed is obligated to purchase from us  and we are obligated to sell to nycomed  the mt that nycomed sells in the countries specified in the agreement  and nycomed is required to reimburse us for certain costs related to the manufacturing of mt the agreement will expire upon an anniversary date of the first commercial sale of mt following final approval by the fda of the nda for mt either party may terminate the agreement in the event of a material breach or default by the other party of the material terms and conditions of the agreement 
among the material breaches that would entitle nycomed to terminate the agreement would be our failure to deliver products to nycomed at a time when nycomed has established an alternative source of the product 
xcel pharmaceuticals  inc in september  we signed an agreement with xcel for the further development and commercialization of mt under the terms of the agreement  xcel will have exclusive rights in the united states to commercialize mt subject to certain minimum commercialization obligations 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  xcel paid us an upfront fee of million 
under certain circumstances  if we withdraw the nda for mt  we would be required to pay to xcel a termination fee of million 
potential milestone payments of up to million will be due upon certain future regulatory approvals  including the fda s approvals relating to mt  and the achievement of a predetermined sales threshold on mt xcel is also obligated to pay us royalties on all combined sales of mt and xcel s dhe dihydroergotamine mesylate injection  upon commercialization of mt  until at least the expiration of the last to expire issued applicable patent  based upon the scheduled expiration of the last to expire currently issued applicable patent  subject to reduction in certain instances of generic competition  or in the event that xcel pays royalties to one or more third parties to license rights from such third parties to commercialize mt the agreement terminates on the date of expiration of all royalty obligations  based upon the scheduled expiration of the last to expire currently issued applicable patent unless earlier terminated by either party for a material breach or in the event that either party determines not to pursue approval of mt under certain circumstances  the agreement provides for the terminating party to facilitate the assumption of its responsibilities by the non terminating party 
generally  each party must indemnify the other for damages arising from such party s breach of its representations  warranties and obligations under the agreement  as well as for the gross negligence or willful misconduct by either party 
additionally  xcel must indemnify us for damages arising from the development  manufacture or use of any product after the effective date of the agreement  while we must indemnify xcel for any damages arising from such development  manufacture or use prior to the effective date 
we must also indemnify xcel for any use by us or any sub licensee of certain technology owned by xcel 
based upon the delayed commercialization of mt due to the not approvable letter for mt and our efforts to address with the fda the issues raised in the that letter  we and xcel have mutually agreed  in writing  to extend the time for certain activities under our agreement with xcel that are dependent on the fda s actions with respect to mt in february  valeant reported that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire xcel and on march  reported that the acquisition had been completed 
manufacturing we currently have no manufacturing capability and we do not intend to establish internal manufacturing capabilities 
to date  we have entered into arrangements with third party manufacturers for the supply of formulated and packaged mt  mt and mt clinical trial materials and clinical supply materials for our exploratory program clinical trials 
we believe our current supplier agreements should be sufficient to complete both our ongoing and planned clinical trials 
pursuant to our development and commercialization agreement with gsk for mt  gsk will supply us with the required clinical trial materials to conduct our mt clinical trials covered under the agreement 
use of third party manufacturers enables us to focus on our clinical development activities  minimize fixed costs and capital expenditures and gain access to advanced manufacturing process capabilities and expertise 
we also intend to enter into agreements with third party manufacturers for the commercial scale manufacturing of our products 
in january  we entered into a commercial supply agreement with dsm pharmaceuticals  inc dsm  formerly catalytica pharmaceuticals  inc 
under which dsm will supply us with all mt for domestic and non domestic commercial sale 
we  or our commercial partners  are required to purchase all commercial supply of mt from dsm for the initial term of the agreement the first three years after fda approval and any extension thereof  unless dsm is unable to meet our  or our commercial partners  requirements 
we have the right to terminate the agreement under certain circumstances after the initial term 
in october  we entered into a commercial supply agreement with lek pharmaceuticals inc lek  a subsidiary of novartis pharma ag  under which lek agreed to provide us with dhe  which we will formulate as mt we agreed to purchase dhe exclusively from lek  which exclusivity is dependent upon lek s ability to meet our supply requirements and certain other conditions 
lek will supply to us solely and exclusively  under certain circumstances 
we will pay lek  under certain circumstances  a fee in addition to the agreed supply price for dhe  based on a percentage of mt sales revenue 
the initial term of the agreement terminates on the fifteenth th anniversary of the date of the first commercial sale of mt  but is automatically renewed on an annual basis thereafter unless canceled or terminated 
either party may cancel the agreement upon a material breach 
we may terminate the agreement if we elect to stop development or commercialization of mt  or after a period of time specified in the agreement 
in addition  lek may terminate the agreement after a certain period of time  under agreed transition  supply and know how transfer provisions  if lek decides to permanently cease the manufacture of dhe 

table of contents competition competition for our migraine products that receive regulatory approval will come from several different sources 
because not all migraine attacks are of the same severity  a variety of oral  injectable and intranasal therapies are used to treat different types of migraine attacks 
attacks are often treated initially with simple over the counter analgesics  particularly if the patient is unable to determine if the attack is a migraine or some other type of headache 
these analgesics include excedrin migraine  which is approved for the pain associated with migraine 
if over the counter remedies are unsuccessful  patients often turn to more potent prescription drugs  including triptans 
according to ims  in  total triptan sales in the us were approximately billion 
imitrex  a triptan product marketed by gsk  had total us sales of approximately billion in  according to ims 
narcotics such as codeine and drugs containing analgesic narcotic combinations  along with other non narcotic pain medications  are also used for the treatment of migraine 
if approved  our migraine product candidates will most likely compete with one or more of these existing migraine therapeutics  as well as any therapies developed in the future 
based upon their current migraine portfolios  gsk  merck co  medpointe pharmaceuticals  johnson johnson  pfizer  inc and endo pharmaceuticals will be our principal competitors if the company s migraine product candidates are approved 
the us prescription market for nsaids was approximately billion in  of which was accounted for by the cox inhibitors  according to ims 
this market is undergoing significant change  due to the voluntary withdrawal of vioxx by merck co 
in september  and the convening of an fda advisory committee meeting in february to review data on the cox inhibitors and other nsaids 
uncertainty in this market is likely to continue until the fda provides guidance after the advisory committee meeting 
the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological progress 
certain pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies and academic and research organizations currently engage in  or have engaged in  efforts related to the discovery and development of new medicines for the treatment of migraine symptoms 
significant levels of research in chemistry and biotechnology occur in universities and other nonprofit research institutions 
these entities have become increasingly active in seeking patent protection and licensing revenues for their research results 
they also compete with us in recruiting skilled scientific talent 
our ability to compete successfully will be based on our ability to create and maintain scientifically advanced technology  develop proprietary products  attract and retain scientific personnel  obtain patent or other protection for our products  obtain required regulatory approvals and manufacture and successfully market our products either alone or through outside parties 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial  research and development  manufacturing  marketing and human resources and greater experience than we do in product discovery  development  clinical trial management  fda regulatory review  manufacturing and marketing  which may enable them to compete more effectively than we can 
patents and proprietary information we have obtained and intend to actively seek to obtain  when appropriate  protection for our products and proprietary technology by means of us and foreign patents  trademarks and contractual arrangements 
in addition  we rely upon trade secrets and contractual agreements to protect certain of our proprietary technology and products 
we have six issued us patents and five pending us patent applications  and we presently have pending foreign patent applications or issued foreign patents  relating to mt  mt and our mt technology 
we also have us and foreign patent applications pending relating to novel product concepts 
there can be no assurance that our patent applications will issue as patents or  with respect to our issued patents  that they will provide us with significant protection 
the following provides a general description of our patent portfolio and is not intended to represent an assessment of claim limitations or claim scope 
mt we have two issued us patents  one with claims relating to dosage forms that can be used in administering metoclopramide and a long acting nsaid to a patient with migraine headache and one with claims relating to various pharmaceutical compositions and treatment methods that can be used with migraine patients 
within these issued us patents are also claims relating to a method of manufacturing a specific type of dosage form 
we submitted one of our issued us patents for reissue after determining that certain specified claims that are not central to our protection of mt should not have been issued 
a third party has filed a protest regarding the reissuance of that mt patent 
we do not know the weight the examiner will give to the protest 
however  we believe the protest to be without merit 
we have issued patents in australia  europe and canada 
we have one pending us patent application with claims relating to various pharmaceutical compositions and treatment methods that can be used for migraine patients 
in addition  there is an application relating to mt that is pending in japan 
the expected expiration date of all the issued us and foreign patents relating to mt is november  additional us and foreign patents  if issued  are expected to expire in a similar timeframe 
mt with respect to mt  we received us  european and australian patents relating to a high potency formulation of dhe and formulations of dhe in a pre filled syringe 
we also have pending us  canadian  japanese and australian patent applications 
table of contents with claims relating to high potency formulations and therapeutic packages  and we have patent applications pending in other major markets worldwide 
the expected expiration date of all of the us and foreign patents relating to mt is march  additional us and foreign patents  if issued  would be expected to expire in a similar timeframe 
mt we have three issued us patents with claims relating to methods  compositions and therapeutic packages involving the use of certain nsaids and ht receptor agonists in treating patients with migraine 
outside of the us  we have issued patents in australia and europe and patent applications relating to our mt technology pending in canada and japan 
the expected expiration date of the issued us patents relating to mt is august  foreign patents  if issued  are expected to expire in a similar timeframe 
we have also filed a us patent application with claims directed to formulations of mt exploratory programs we have filed us and foreign patent applications with claims directed to novel compositions and formulations for the combination of ppis and nsaids 
should any patents issue from these applications they would be expected to expire on may  we have filed provisional us patent applications with claims directed to novel compositions and formulations for new product concepts which are currently in the exploratory stage 
if we pursue these provisional applications into prosecution as regular patent applications  any patents which issue from these applications would be expected to expire between and government regulation the fda and comparable regulatory agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the clinical development  manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical product candidates 
these agencies and other federal  state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing  manufacture  quality control  safety  effectiveness  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval and promotion of our product candidates 
all of our product candidates will require regulatory approval before commercialization 
in particular  therapeutic product candidates for human use are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other requirements of the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act ffdca  implemented by the fda  as well as similar statutory and regulatory requirements of foreign countries 
obtaining these marketing approvals and subsequently complying with ongoing statutory and regulatory requirements is costly and time consuming 
any failure by us or our collaborators  licensors or licensees to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals or in complying with other requirements could adversely affect the commercialization of product candidates then being developed by us and our ability to receive product or royalty revenues 
the steps required before a new drug product candidate may be distributed commercially in the us generally include conducting appropriate preclinical laboratory evaluations of the product candidate s chemistry  formulation and stability and preclinical studies in animals to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate  submitting the results of these evaluations and tests to the fda  along with manufacturing information and analytical data  in an investigational new drug application  or ind  initiating clinical trials under the ind after the resolution of any safety or regulatory concerns of the fda  obtaining approval of institutional review boards  or irbs  to introduce the drug into humans in clinical studies  conducting adequate and well controlled human clinical trials that establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for the intended use  typically in the following three sequential  or slightly overlapping stages phase the product is initially introduced into human subjects or patients and tested for safety  dose tolerance  absorption  metabolism  distribution and excretion  phase the product candidate is studied in patients to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks  to determine dosage tolerance and the optimal dosage  and to collect some efficacy data  phase the product candidate is studied in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical study sites  to confirm efficacy and safety at the optimized dose  by measuring primary and secondary endpoints established at the outset of the study  submitting the results of preclinical studies  and clinical trials as well as chemistry  manufacturing and control information on the product candidate to the fda in a new drug application form  or nda  and obtaining fda approval of the nda prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the product candidate 
this process can take a number of years and require substantial financial resources 
the results of preclinical studies and initial clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of the results from large scale clinical trials  and clinical trials may be subject to additional costs  delays or modifications due to a number of factors  including the difficulty in obtaining enough patients  clinical investigators  product candidate supply or financial support 

table of contents even after fda approval has been obtained  further studies  including post marketing studies  may be required 
results of post marketing studies may limit or expand the further marketing of the products 
if we propose any modifications to a product  including changes in indication  manufacturing process  manufacturing facility or labeling  a supplement to our nda may be required to be submitted to the fda 
the fda may also require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved product candidates that have been commercialized  and the agency has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product candidate based on the results of these post marketing programs 
upon approval  a product candidate may be marketed only in those dosage forms and for those indications approved in the nda 
the status of the ndas we have submitted to the fda for mt and mt is discussed above in migraine product candidates mt and migraine product candidates mt in addition to obtaining fda approval for each indication to be treated with each product candidate  each domestic product candidate manufacturing establishment must register with the fda  list its product with the fda  comply with the applicable fda current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp  regulations  which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance  as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation  and permit and pass manufacturing plant inspections by the fda 
moreover  the submission of applications for approval may require additional time to complete manufacturing stability studies 
foreign establishments manufacturing product for distribution in the us also must list their product candidates with the fda and comply with cgmp regulations 
they are also subject to periodic inspection by the fda or by local authorities under agreement with the fda 
any product candidates manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to fda approvals are subject to extensive continuing regulation by the fda  including record keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences with the product candidate 
in addition to continued compliance with standard regulatory requirements  the fda may also require post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the marketed product 
adverse experiences with the product candidate must be reported to the fda 
product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product are discovered following approval 
the ffdca also mandates that products be manufactured consistent with cgmp regulations 
in complying with the cgmp regulations  manufacturers must continue to spend time  money and effort in production  record keeping  quality control  and auditing to ensure that the marketed product meets applicable specifications and other requirements 
the fda periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with cgmp regulations 
failure to comply subjects the manufacturer to possible fda action  such as warning letters  suspension of manufacturing  seizure of the product  voluntary recall of a product or injunctive action  as well as possible civil penalties 
we currently rely on  and intend to continue to rely on  third parties to manufacture our compounds and product candidates 
these third parties will be required to comply with cgmp regulations 
products manufactured in the us for distribution abroad will be subject to fda regulations regarding export  as well as to the requirements of the country to which they are shipped 
these latter requirements are likely to cover the conduct of clinical trials  the submission of marketing applications  and all aspects of manufacturing and marketing 
such requirements can vary significantly from country to country 
we and our contractors are also subject to various federal  state and local laws  rules  regulations and policies relating to safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices  the experimental use of animals and the use of and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research work 
although we believe that safety procedures employed for handling and disposing of such materials comply with current federal  state and local laws  rules  regulations and policies  the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials cannot be entirely eliminated 
before a medicinal product can be supplied in the european union eu  it must first be granted a marketing authorization 
there are two routes by which this may be achieved the centralized procedure whereby an approval granted by the european commission permits the supply of the product in question throughout the eu or the mutual recognition procedure mrp where a marketing authorization granted by one national authority the reference member state is recognized by the authorities of the other member states concerned member states when conducting their reviews 
this process leads to individual licenses in each member state for the supply of products in that country only 
the centralized route is compulsory for biotechnology products and is optional for certain so called high technology products 
all products which are not authorized by the centralized route must be authorized by the mrp unless the product is designed for use in a single country in which case a national application can be made 
in the uk  the regulation of medicinal products is governed by the medicines act of and subsequent delegated legislation 
essentially all applications  which must include full details of the product and the research that has been carried out to establish its efficacy  safety and quality  must be presented for review by the competent authority  the mhra 
the mhra will assess the data presented to ensure that the product satisfies the appropriate requirements for efficacy  safety and quality 
they may seek additional evaluation by an advisory committee  the committee on safety of medicines referred to in this k as the mhra advisory committee 
the mhra advisory committee may  if it wishes  advise the mhra to refuse an application 

table of contents mt is a fixed combination medicinal product incorporating two previously approved active ingredients 
such products will only be considered acceptable by the mhra if the proposed combination is based on valid therapeutic principles 
the possibility of interactions between the substances will be assessed and it will be necessary to establish that either interactions do not occur  or if they do occur  they are clearly established and defined 
furthermore  special safety and efficacy requirements apply to fixed combination products in that the dosage of each active ingredient within the combination product must have a documented contribution within the combination and the combination should demonstrate a level of efficacy above that achieved by a single substance with an acceptable safety profile 
the status of the maa we submitted for mt is discussed above under migraine product candidates mt if the mhra grants the authorization for the product to be marketed in the uk  further applications will typically be made to the competent authorities of other eu countries by way of the mrp 
the competent authorities of the designated eu countries will be requested to recognize the authorization of the mhra based upon an assessment report prepared by the mhra 
the process should take no longer than days  but if one country makes an objection which  under the legislation  can only be based on a possible risk to human health  but in practice has been used by some countries to cover issues beyond the scope of the legislation  we have the option to withdraw the application from that country or take the application to arbitration by the committee for propriety medicinal products cpmp of the emea 
if a referral is made  the procedure is suspended and in the intervening time the only eu country in which the product can be marketed will be the uk  even if all other designated countries are ready to recognize the product 
the opinion of the cpmp  which is binding  could support or reflect the objections or alternatively reach a compromise position acceptable to all eu countries concerned 
arbitration can be avoided if the application is withdrawn in the objecting country  but once the application has been referred to arbitration it cannot be withdrawn 
the arbitration procedure may take an additional year before a final decision is reached and may require the delivery of additional data 
once granted  any marketing authorization ma remains subject to pharmacovigilance and all competent authorities have the power to vary  suspend or revoke an ma on grounds of safety 
the extent of us and foreign government regulation which might result from future legislation or administrative action cannot be accurately predicted 
for example  in the us  although the food and drug administration modernization act of modified and created requirements and standards under the ffdca with the intent of facilitating product development and marketing  the fda is still in the process of developing regulations implementing the food and drug administration modernization act of consequently  the actual effect of these and other developments on our own business is uncertain and unpredictable

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a pharmaceutical company focused primarily on products for the treatment of migraine  acute and chronic pain and other pain related indications 
our product development emphasis is on diseases with unmet medical needs where we can improve efficacy  safety and or patient convenience 
since our inception  we have focused our efforts primarily on the development or regulatory approval of pharmaceutical products for the treatment of migraine 
since inception  our business activities have included product candidate research and development  
table of contents designing and conducting clinical trials for our product candidates  regulatory and clinical affairs  intellectual property prosecution and expansion  and business development  including product acquisition and or licensing and collaboration activities 
our portfolio currently contains three product candidates in the migraine area  mt  mt and mt we are also exploring the development of product candidates in other acute and chronic pain and pain related therapeutic areas 
we have not obtained regulatory approval for any of our product candidates 
our mt technology refers to our proprietary combinations of a triptan htb d agonist and an nsaid 
in june  we signed an agreement with gsk for the development and commercialization of proprietary combinations of one or more of gsk s triptans and a long acting nsaid 
the combinations covered by the agreement are among the combinations of our mt technology 
trexima is the proposed brand name for the combination of gsk s sumatriptan and naproxen sodium in a single tablet being developed pursuant to our agreement with gsk 
mt  a combination of metoclopramide hydrochloride and naproxen sodium  is intended to provide effective migraine relief with less risk of cardiovascular side effects compared to the triptans 
mt  a proprietary formulation of injectable dhe in a pre filled syringe  is intended to provide long lasting pain relief for patients needing a convenient injectable therapy for severe migraine attacks 
we currently have two exploratory programs in pain related therapeutic areas 
we have begun exploratory development work and clinical studies to investigate the development of novel product candidates containing lornoxicam  alone or in combination with other active ingredients  as potential treatments for pain or other indications 
this exploratory work is being conducted under an exclusive option agreement with nycomed pursuant to which we may acquire a license to certain rights related to lornoxicam 
if we elect to exercise our option to license lornoxicam  which expires in july  we will be required to pay nycomed a million licensing fee  regulatory approval milestones and royalties on sales of any products developed using the licensed rights 
in our other exploratory program  we have begun exploratory formulation development and clinical studies for a combination of a ppi and an nsaid in a single tablet intended to provide effective control of pain and inflammation with fewer gastrointestinal complications compared to an nsaid taken alone 
we have financed our operations and internal growth primarily through private placements of preferred stock  our initial public offering and  beginning in  payments received under our collaborations 
beginning in the third quarter of  we began recognizing revenue from initial payments received under our collaboration agreements 
we have entered into three collaboration agreements with nycomed for the commercialization of mt in four nordic countries  gsk for the development and commercialization of proprietary combinations of one or more of gsk s triptans and a long acting nsaid in the us and xcel for the further development and commercialization of mt in the us we plan to seek additional partnering opportunities to commercialize our product candidates in other countries 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception and have not generated any revenue from product sales 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
our historical operating losses have resulted principally from our research and development activities  including phase clinical trial activities for our product candidates mt  mt and trexima  and general and administrative expenses 
research and development expenses include salaries and benefits for personnel involved in our research and development activities and direct development costs  which include costs relating to the formulation and manufacturing of our product candidates  costs relating to preclinical studies  including toxicology studies  and clinical trials  and costs relating to compliance with regulatory requirements applicable to the development of our product candidates 
since inception  our research and development expenses have represented of our total operating expenses 
for the year ended december   our research and development expenses represented approximately of our total operating expenses 
statement of financial accounting standards board no 
sfas  accounting and reporting by development stage enterprises  states that an enterprise shall be considered to be in the development stage if either planned principal operations have not commenced or planned principal operations have commenced  but there has been no significant revenue therefrom 
we will remain a development stage company until such time as significant revenues have been generated from the marketing and sale of our product candidates 
we expect that we may continue to incur operating losses over the next several years as we complete the development and seek regulatory approval for our product candidates  develop other product candidates and acquire and develop product portfolios in other therapeutic areas 
our results may vary depending on many factors  including our progress in reversing the fda s not approvable decisions with respect to mt and mt  the progress of trexima and our other product candidates in the clinical and regulatory process  the establishment of new collaborations and progress of our existing collaborations for the development and commercialization of any of our product candidates  the acquisition and or in licensing  and development  of other therapeutic product candidates  and 
table of contents our costs related to the lawsuits that have been filed against us and our current or former directors and officers relating to the approvability of mt and mt the status of these proceedings is discussed under item legal proceedings herein 
our ability to generate revenue is dependent upon our ability  alone or with others  to achieve the milestones set forth in our collaboration agreements and successfully develop our migraine and other product candidates  obtain regulatory approvals and successfully manufacture and commercialize our future products 
status and expenses related to our product candidates there follows a brief discussion of the status of the development of each of trexima  mt  mt  and our other product candidates  as well the costs relating to our development activities 
our direct research and development expenses for the fiscal years ended december  and were million  million  and million  respectively 
our research and development expenses that are not direct development costs consist of personnel and other research and development departmental costs and are not allocated by product candidate 
we do not maintain records that allocate our employees time by the projects on which they work and  therefore  are unable to identify costs related to the time that employees spend on research and development by product candidate 
total compensation and benefit costs for our personnel involved in our research and development activities for the fiscal years ended december  and were million  million  and million  respectively 
other research and development department costs for the fiscal years ended december   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
mt trexima 
in may  we commenced the phase clinical program for trexima 
as part of the phase program  we have planned two phase pivotal trials designed to determine the effectiveness and safety of trexima for the acute treatment of migraine as well as to satisfy the requirements of the fda s combination drug rule  the first of which was completed in february in addition  we are conducting a long term  open label safety study 
along with these program trials  gsk is funding and currently conducting two phase b studies 
we expect to file an nda for trexima in the second half of we cannot reasonably estimate or know the amount or timing of costs necessary to complete the development of trexima or when  if and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from trexima 
the additional costs that we may incur include expenses relating to clinical trials and other research and development activities associated with the packaging and labeling of our product and the cost and timing of regulatory approvals 
we have incurred direct development costs associated with the development of trexima for the fiscal years ended december   and and from inception to date of million  million  million and million  respectively 
our direct development costs do not include the cost of research and development personnel or any allocation of our overhead expenses 
mt in july  we submitted an nda to the fda for mt in may  we received a not approvable letter from the fda with respect to our nda 
since the issuance of the not approvable letter  we have had continuing communications with the staff of the fda to seek to persuade the fda that mt should be approved based upon the data that we submitted in the nda for mt we and the fda have agreed to present mt data  with particular emphasis on the potential risk of tardive dyskinesia  to an fda advisory committee 
the fda has advised us that the meeting with the advisory committee  which we previously reported had been tentatively scheduled for may  has been postponed due to fda scheduling conflicts 
we do not know when the meeting will be rescheduled  however  we have been informed by the fda that the rescheduled meeting date will be available  in advance  when published in the federal register 
it is possible that we may be required to conduct another clinical study and or conduct investigations to provide additional evidence to support the approval of mt we cannot estimate the cost or duration of any such study or investigation or decide whether to conduct such a study or investigation until the results of the meeting with the fda advisory committee are known and the design of any such study or studies has been determined with the fda 
our phase clinical trials for mt took between three months and eighteen months and involved a direct cost per patient of between  and  the duration and cost of any new study that we may conduct may be different from our prior clinical trials 
no assurance can be given that our efforts to obtain approval of mt will ultimately be successful 
in october  we submitted an maa for mt to the mhra in the uk 
in september  we received a letter of comments relating to our maa from the mhra advisory committee to which we subsequently responded 
in january  we were notified that the mhra advisory committee was prepared to advise the mhra that a marketing authorization could be granted for mt in the uk  provided we supply certain additional information and meet certain conditions  as outlined by the mhra advisory committee 
in february  we provided information to the mhra advisory committee which we believe addresses all the conditions set forth by the mhra advisory committee 
we are not currently conducting any clinical trials for mt however  we are continuing to incur pharmaceutical development costs for product stability testing and costs relating to our continuing efforts to obtain approval of mt from the fda and in the uk 
additionally  we may incur costs for the commercialization of this product if our applications are approved by the fda and in the uk 
until the not approvable letter is definitively resolved with the fda and we receive final approval of the maa from the mhra  we cannot reasonably estimate the amount and timing of additional costs that we may need to incur to satisfy comments 
table of contents or conditions on our applications for approval or when  if and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from mt the additional costs that we may incur include expenses related to clinical trials  formulation  manufacturing and labeling of our product and regulatory consulting expenses required to address the fda s and mhra s responses to our applications 
we have incurred direct development costs associated with the development of mt for the fiscal years ended december   and and from inception to date of million  million  million and million  respectively 
our direct development costs do not include the cost of research and development personnel or any allocation of our overhead expenses 
mt in december  we submitted to the fda an nda for approval of mt in october  we received a not approvable letter from the fda with respect to our nda for mt subsequently  we submitted additional responses to the not approvable letter and requested a type a meeting with the fda s division of neuropharmacological drug products to present our position in response to the issues identified by the fda 
the type a meeting was held in december and a subsequent teleconference with the fda occurred in january during which the fda restated its concerns that approval of mt was problematic due to the higher incidence of nausea at two hours following dosing in patients treated with mt compared with placebo 
once we receive and review the fda s meeting minutes  we will evaluate what future steps are available to us regarding mt we are not currently conducting any clinical trials for mt however  we are continuing to incur pharmaceutical development costs for product stability testing and costs relating to our continuing efforts to seek approval of mt and may conduct additional phase b marketing studies if our application is approved by the fda 
until we complete our discussions with the fda concerning the not approvable letter and review the minutes from our recent meeting with the fda  we cannot reasonably estimate the amount and timing of additional costs that we may need to incur with respect to mt or when  if and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from mt the additional costs that we may incur include expenses relating to clinical trials  formulation  manufacturing and labeling of our product and regulatory consulting expenses required to address the fda s response to our application 
we have incurred direct development costs associated with the development of mt for the fiscal years ended december   and and from inception to date of million  million  million and million  respectively 
our direct development costs do not include the cost of research and development personnel or any allocation of our overhead expenses 
our exploratory programs 
in september  we met with the fda to review the results of our first lornoxicam study  to discuss information provided in the ind  and to discuss non clinical issues and potential additional clinical studies 
we also met with the fda in january and reached agreement on our proposal for studies to demonstrate efficacy of a ppi nsaid combination 
we cannot reasonably estimate or know the amount or timing of the costs necessary to continue exploratory development and or complete the development of any lornoxicam or pn product candidates we may seek to develop  or when  if and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from either of these research programs 
the additional costs that may be incurred include expenses relating to clinical trials and other research and development activities associated with the packaging and labeling of our products and the cost and timing of activities necessary to obtain regulatory approvals 
we have incurred direct development costs associated with the development of our exploratory programs  the lornoxicam and pn product candidates  for the fiscal year ended december  and from inception to date of million and million  respectively 
our direct development costs do not include the cost of research and development personnel or any allocation of our overhead expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates management makes certain judgments and uses certain estimates and assumptions when applying accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in the preparation of our financial statements 
the development and selection of the critical accounting policies  and the related disclosure about these policies  have been reviewed by the audit committee of our board of directors 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on going basis and base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements  we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us in that they are important to the portrayal of our financial statements and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition our licensing and other collaborative agreements have terms that include up front payments upon contract signing  additional payments if and when certain milestones in the product s development are reached  and royalty payments based on future product sales 
we recognize revenue under these agreements in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition as amended by sab revenue recognition sab  and emerging issues task force eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
under sab recognition of revenue from non refundable up front payments is deferred by us upon receipt and recognized over the period ending on the anticipated dates of regulatory approvals  as specified in the agreements relating to the product candidates 

table of contents we recognize milestone payments as revenue upon the achievement of specified milestones if i the milestone is substantive in nature and the achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement and ii if the fees are non refundable 
any milestone payments received prior to satisfying these revenue recognition criteria will be recorded as deferred revenue 
royalty revenue will be recognized related to the manufacture  sale or use of our products or technology 
for those arrangements where royalties are reasonably estimable  we will recognize revenue based on estimates of royalties earned during the applicable period and adjust for differences between the estimated and actual royalties in the following period 
for those arrangements where royalties are not reasonably estimable  we will recognize revenue upon receipt of royalty statements from the licensee 
additionally  our licensing agreements may include payment for services provided by us on an hourly rate and direct expenses 
we record such revenue in accordance with the agreements which would generally be based upon time spent and materials used on the project 
management believes that its current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate the periods for revenue recognition described above are appropriate 
however  we continually review these estimates  which could result in a change in the deferral period and might impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
further  if regulatory approvals relating to mt  mt or trexima are accelerated  delayed or not ultimately obtained  then the amortization of revenues for these products would prospectively be accelerated or reduced accordingly 
as of december   we had deferred million of revenue  of which from million to million is refundable under certain termination or cancellation provisions within our licensing agreements 
during the twelve month periods ended december  and  we recognized million and million of revenue relating to our collaboration agreements  respectively 
accrued expenses  including contracted costs significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with accrued expenses  including those related to contract costs  such as costs associated with our clinical trials 
specifically  our management must make estimates of costs incurred to date but not yet invoiced in relation to contracted  external costs 
management analyzes the progress of product development  clinical trial and toxicology and related activities  invoices received and budgeted costs when evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liability for these related costs 
material differences in the amount and timing of the accrued liability for any period may result if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
management believes that its current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate accrued expenses for the period are appropriate 
however  determining the date on which certain contract services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services involves subjective judgments and often must be based upon information provided by third parties 
in the event that we do not identify certain contract costs which have begun to be incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported accrued expenses for such period would be too low or too high  as the case may be 
in the years ended december   and  we recognized million  million and million respectively  for accrued costs related to product development and operating activities  including clinical trials  based upon the progress of these activities covered by the related contracts  invoices received and budgeted costs 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the net tax effects of tax credits  operating loss carry forwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish an annual valuation allowance 
we have not recorded any tax provision or benefit for the years ended december    or since we are unable to conclude whether we will realize any future benefit from deductible temporary differences and net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million for federal and state income tax purposes  which are available to offset future federal and state taxable income  if any  and expire between and  we have provided a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets 
we also have research and development tax credit carry forwards of approximately million for federal income tax reporting purposes which are available to reduce federal income taxes  if any  and expire between and the tax reform act of the tax reform act provides for a limitation on the annual use of net operating loss and research and development tax credit carry forwards following certain ownership changes  as defined by the tax reform act that could significantly limit our ability to utilize these carry forwards 
we have experienced various ownership changes  as defined by the tax reform act  as a result of past financings 
accordingly  our ability to utilize the aforementioned carry forwards may be limited 
if results of operations in the future indicate that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be recovered  the reduction of the valuation allowance will be recorded as a tax benefit during one or more periods 

table of contents historical results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net income loss per share net loss attributable to common stockholders for the year ended december  was million or per share  as compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  revenue we recognized million of licensing revenue for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase resulted from the amortization of upfront payments we received in pursuant to development and commercialization agreements relating to mt  mt and mt  from a million milestone payment we received from gsk as a result of commencement of trexima phase clinical trial activities in the second quarter of and from a million payment from gsk for conducting trexima phase clinical trial activities in the fourth quarter of our license agreements have terms that include upfront payments upon contract signing and additional payments if and when certain milestones in the product development or related milestones are achieved 
all upfront payments were deferred and are being amortized over the periods ending on the anticipated dates of regulatory approvals  as specified in the agreements relating to the product candidates 
approximately million remained in deferred revenue at december  substantive milestone payments are recognized as revenue upon completion of the contractual events 
research and development research and development expenses increased by to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase was due primarily to an increase in direct development costs for trexima and our current exploratory programs  and other departmental expenses  offset by a decrease in direct development costs associated with mt and mt direct development costs associated with trexima increased by million to million  primarily due to phase clinical trial activities during  as compared to the same period of direct development costs associated with our current exploratory programs increased by million to million  primarily due to phase clinical trial activities for our lornoxicam program and pharmaceutical development activities for the lornoxicam and our other exploratory programs during  as compared to mt direct development costs decreased by million to million  primarily due to costs incurred in preparing and filing an nda with the fda in  as compared to the same period of direct development costs associated with mt decreased by million to million  primarily due to mt product supply expenses incurred during as compared to the same period of research and development departmental expenses increased by million to million  primarily due to an increase in personnel related costs associated with our product development activities and legal and consulting costs incurred for mt and mt regulatory activities 
we have included in our research and development expenses the personnel costs associated with our research and development activities and costs associated with pharmaceutical development  clinical trials  toxicology activities  and regulatory matters 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased by to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the million decrease was due primarily to a decrease in the costs associated with our business development activities and personnel related expenses offset by an increase in costs related to our public company activities 
business development expenses decreased by million to million  primarily due to a greater level of pre commercialization activities for mt and mt in  as compared to the same period of administrative expenses decreased by million to million in  as compared to the period  primarily due to the payment of million for incentive compensation to our chief executive officer in costs associated with our public company activities increased by million to million  primarily due to legal fees associated with the class action litigation pending against us and other professional consulting fees incurred in preparing for sarbanes oxley regulatory compliance 
general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of the costs of administrative personnel  facility infrastructure  business development expenses and public company activities 
interest income interest income increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period of this increase was due to an increase in interest rates and our average cash balance available for investing during  as compared to the same period of year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income loss per share net loss attributable to common stockholders for the year ended december  was million or per share  as compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  revenue we recognized million of licensing revenue for the year ended december  as compared to no revenue for the year ended december  revenue resulted from initial payments we received pursuant to development and commercialization agreements for mt  mt and mt our license agreements have terms that include upfront payments upon contract signing and additional payments if and when certain milestones in the product development or related milestones are achieved 
all upfront payments were deferred and are being amortized over the periods ending on the anticipated dates of regulatory approvals  as specified in the agreements relating to the product candidates 
approximately million remained in deferred revenue at december  substantive milestone payments are recognized as revenue upon completion of the contractual events 

table of contents research and development research and development expenses decreased by to million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the million decrease was due primarily to a decrease in direct development costs for mt and mt direct development costs associated with mt decreased by million to million  primarily due to completion of phase clinical trial activities and submission of the nda for mt to the fda in  as compared to direct development costs associated with mt decreased by million to million  primarily due to a reduction in pharmaceutical development activities  including costs incurred in obtaining drug substance  and reduced costs associated with toxicology activities  as compared to the same period of additional research and development expenses  including costs associated with exploratory lornoxicam product development  other exploratory development and departmental expenses  increased by million to million 
the amortization of deferred stock compensation decreased by million 
total amortization of deferred stock compensation included in research and development expenses was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we have included in our research and development expenses the personnel costs associated with our research activities and costs associated with pharmaceutical development  clinical trial and toxicology activities and regulatory matters 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased by to million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the million increase was due primarily to increased costs associated with administrative  business development and public company activities 
administrative costs increased by million  primarily due to a million incentive compensation payment to our chief executive officer pursuant to a performance based award issued under pozen s long term incentive plan 
costs associated with business development activities increased by million due to pre marketing activities for mt and mt  and consulting fees associated with the licensing of our product candidates 
costs associated with our public company activities increased by million due to an increase in legal and auditing fees and an increase in director liability insurance and director compensation 
other departmental expenses decreased by million  primarily due to a million decrease in the amortization of deferred stock compensation 
total amortization of deferred stock compensation included in general and administrative expenses was million and million for and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of the costs of administrative personnel  facility infrastructure  business development and public company activities 
interest income interest income decreased by to million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  interest income decreased primarily due to a decline in interest rates during the year 
income taxes as of december   we had available net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million for federal and state income tax purposes  which are available to offset future federal and state taxable income  if any  and expire between and we also have research and development tax credit carry forwards of approximately million for federal income tax reporting purposes which are available to reduce federal income taxes  if any  through since our inception  we have incurred substantial losses and expect to incur substantial and recurring losses in future periods 
the tax reform act limits the annual use of net operating loss and research and development tax credit carry forwards following certain ownership changes  as defined by the tax reform act 
we have experienced various ownership changes  as defined by the tax reform act  as a result of past financings 
accordingly  our ability to utilize the aforementioned carry forwards may be limited 
additionally  because us tax laws limit the time during which these carry forwards may be applied against future taxes  we may not be able to take full advantage of these carry forwards for federal income tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations and internal growth primarily through private placements of preferred stock and our initial public offering  resulting in cash of million  and  since  from upfront and milestone payments from our collaborators  resulting in cash of million 
as of december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  a decrease of million as compared to december  our cash and cash equivalent are invested primarily in short term  highly rated investments  including us government securities  commercial paper and certificates of deposit guaranteed by banks 
operating cash received during the twelve month period ended december  totaled million  resulting from payments received under our collaboration agreement with gsk for our mt technology 
a milestone payment of million was received in may for commencement of phase clinical trial activities relating to trexima and a million payment was received in december for payment for two phase clinical trials 
we expect to receive additional milestone payments from gsk over the next several years in an aggregate amount of up to million upon the satisfaction of specified regulatory and commercialization events for trexima 
cash received from financing activities during the period totaled million  reflecting net proceeds from the exercise of stock options 

table of contents based upon the direct method of presenting cash flow  cash paid for operating activities totaled million for the year ended december  the indirect method for presenting cash flow is used in the statement of cash flows 
our operating activities included primarily direct development costs for trexima  particularly phase clinical trial activity  and our current exploratory programs  particularly phase clinical trial activities and pharmaceutical development activities for lornoxicam  along with business development activities and personnel related expenses 
cash paid for operating activities in the fiscal years ended december    and was million  million and million  respectively 
cash required for our operating activities during is projected to approximate our requirements due to the expected cash required to complete of phase clinical trial activities for trexima and to continue development related to our exploratory programs 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
if our operating expenses in and are at the level of our currently expected operating expenses in  and if we do not receive any additional milestone payments under any of our collaboration agreements during or  we will not have sufficient cash reserves to maintain our level of business activities throughout further  our expenses might increase in and if any regulatory agency requires us to conduct additional clinical trials  studies or investigations in connection with their consideration  or reconsideration  of our regulatory filings for mt  mt and trexima 
we do not currently have any milestone or other required material payment obligations during that period 
however  our efforts to reverse the fda s not approvable letters on mt and mt and other regulatory delays or unforeseen developments in the development of our existing and future product candidates may increase our cash requirements beyond our currently assumed needs 
if any of the forgoing occurs  we may seek to raise additional funds 
sources of such funds may not be available on terms favorable to us 
we regularly access available funding options and will consider available funding opportunities as they arise 
we may issue shares of common stock in the future  including to fund additional unplanned development activities 
in february  we filed with the securities and exchange commission a shelf registration statement on form s under which we may register up to  shares of our common stock for sale in one or more public offerings 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our forecast of the period of time through which we expect that our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the number and progress of our clinical trials and other trials and studies  our success in obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates and success in  and manner of  commercializing our products  the success of our existing collaborations and our ability to establish additional collaborations  the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  technologies or products  costs incurred to enforce and defend our patent claims and other intellectual rights  our ability to negotiate favorable terms with various contractors assisting in our trials and studies  and costs incurred in the defense of class action and shareholder derivative lawsuits that have been filed against us or our current or former directors and officers relating to mt and mt obligations and commitments the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of december   and the expected timing of maturities of those contractual obligations 
this table should be read in conjunction with the notes accompanying our financial statements included elsewhere in this form k

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 and revised the interpretation in december fin r 
fin r requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin r is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin r must be applied for the first interim or annual period ending after march  we did not have any ownership in any variable interest entities as of december  we will apply the consolidation requirement of fin r in future periods if we own any interest in any variable interest entity 
as permitted by fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fasb  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of the revised fasb s fasb r fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of fasb r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted fasb r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note above 
fasb r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the decrease in operating cash flows which would have been recognized for such excess tax deductions was million and million in and  respectively 
factors that may affect our results our business is subject to certain risks and uncertainties  each of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
risks related to our business we depend heavily on the success of our product candidates  which may never be approved for commercial use 
if we are unable to develop  gain approval of or commercialize those product candidates  we may never receive revenues from the sale of our product candidates 
we anticipate that for the foreseeable future our ability to achieve profitability will be dependent on the successful development  approval and commercialization of our current product candidates  particularly mt and trexima 
in addition to the inability to obtain regulatory approval  many other factors could negatively affect the success of our efforts to develop and commercialize our product candidates  including those discussed in the risk factors that follow as well as negative  inconclusive or otherwise unfavorable results from any studies or clinical trials  such as those that we obtained with respect to mt  which led to our decision to discontinue development of that product candidate in we have incurred losses since inception and we may continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
we do not have a current source of product revenue 
we have incurred losses in each year since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our ability to receive product revenue from the sale of products is dependent on a number of factors  principally the development  regulatory approval and successful commercialization of our product candidates 
we expect that the amount of our operating losses will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter principally as a result of increases and decreases in our development efforts and the timing of payments that we may receive from others 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses and do not know when  if and to what extent we will generate product revenue 
our only current potential sources of revenue are the payments that we may receive pursuant to our collaboration agreements with nycomed for mt  gsk for trexima and xcel for mt we may never receive milestone payments from nycomed or xcel under these agreements 
in addition  we will have to pay nycomed a withdrawal fee in amounts that range from million to million if we withdraw a required regulatory application for mt in a country specified in the agreement with nycomed  and we will have to repay xcel million if we withdraw the nda for mt for commercial or financial reasons  further  in february  valeant reported that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire xcel and on march  reported that the acquisition had been completed 
we can give no assurance that xcel or valeant will elect to continue the collaboration with us on mt 
table of contents changes in regulatory approval policy or regulations or in the regulatory environment during the development period of any of our product candidates may result in delays in the approval  or rejection  of the application for approval of one or more our product candidates 
if we fail to obtain approval  or are delayed in obtaining approval  of our product candidates  our ability to generate revenue will be severely impaired 
the process of drug development and regulatory approval for product candidates takes many years  during which time the fda s interpretations of the standards against which drugs are judged for approval may evolve or change 
the fda can also change its approval policies based upon changes in laws and regulations 
in addition  it can decide  based on its then current approval policies  any changes in those policies and its broad discretion in the approval process  to weigh the benefits and the risks of every drug candidate 
as a result of any of the foregoing  the fda may decide that the data we submit in support of an application for approval of a drug candidate are insufficient for approval 
further  changes in policy or interpretation may not be the subject of published guidelines and may therefore be difficult to evaluate 
for example  the fda has not recently published guidelines for the approval of new migraine therapies  and we have had to rely on periodic guidance from the fda obtained in conversations and other meetings  the content of which may be subject to significant modification over the period of a drug s development program 
there is also the risk that we and the fda may interpret such guidance differently 
further  additional information about the potential risks of marketed drugs may affect the regulatory approval environment  or the fda s approval policies  for new product candidates 
for example  in february an advisory committee convened by the fda met to address the potential cardiovascular risks of cox selective nsaids and related drugs in response to disclosures made about possible adverse effects from the use of some of these drugs 
we do not know if the recommendations of the advisory committee from that meeting or the fda s actions based upon those recommendations will adversely affect the approvability of our product candidates which include nsaids 
if we  or our collaborators  do not obtain and maintain required regulatory approvals for one or more of our product candidates  we will be unable to commercialize those product candidates and may also be required to pay termination payments under certain of our collaboration agreements 
our product candidates under development are subject to extensive domestic and foreign regulation 
the fda regulates  among other things  the development  testing  manufacture  safety  efficacy  record keeping  labeling  storage  approval  advertisement  promotion  sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products in the united states 
in order to market our products abroad  we must comply with extensive regulation by foreign governments 
if we are unable to obtain and maintain fda and foreign government approvals for our product candidates  we  alone or through our collaborators  will not be permitted to sell them 
failure to obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing that product candidate 
none of our product candidates have been approved for sale in the united states or any foreign market and they may never be approved 
in the united states  a separate nda or supplement must be filed with respect to each indication for which marketing approval of a product is sought 
each nda  in turn  requires the successful completion of preclinical  toxicology  genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies  as well as clinical trials demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the product for that particular indication 
we may not receive regulatory approval of any of the ndas that we file with the fda or of any approval applications we may seek outside the united states 
for example  as described in the risk factors that follow  we are currently seeking to resolve issues raised by the fda related to our mt and mt ndas and by the mhra related to our maa for mt in the uk 
further  our agreements may require us to make certain payments to our collaborators based on our inability to obtain  or delays in obtaining  regulatory approval for our product candidates 
for example  under certain circumstances  we may elect to withdraw the nda for mt in that case  if we withdraw the nda for mt for commercial or financial reasons  the terms of our agreement with xcel would require us to pay to xcel a termination fee of million 
similarly  under our agreement with nycomed  we will be required to pay a withdrawal fee  in amounts that range from million to million  if we withdraw a regulatory application in any of the countries identified in the agreement 
in addition  we would forfeit the ability to receive potential aggregate milestone payments of up to million under the xcel agreement and of between million and million under the nycomed agreement  as well as royalties under either agreement 
if we or our contract manufacturers do not maintain required regulatory approvals  we may not be able to commercialize our products 
approval of a product candidate may be conditioned upon certain limitations and restrictions as to the drug s use  or upon the conduct of further studies  and is subject to continuous review 
the fda may also require us to conduct additional post approval studies 
these post approval studies may include carcinogenicity studies in animals or further human clinical trials 
the later discovery of previously unknown problems with the product  manufacturer or manufacturing facility may result in criminal prosecution  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  or total or partial suspension of production  as well as other regulatory action against our product candidates or us 
if approvals are withdrawn for a product  or if a product is seized or recalled  we would be unable to sell that product and therefore would not receive any revenues from that product 
we and our contract manufacturers are required to comply with the applicable fda current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations  which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance  as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation 

table of contents further  manufacturing facilities must be approved by the fda before they can be used to manufacture our product candidates  and are subject to additional fda inspection 
we  or our third party manufacturers  may not be able to comply with cgmp regulations or other fda regulatory requirements  which could result in a delay or an inability to manufacture the products 
labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and state regulatory agencies and  in some circumstances  the federal trade commission 
fda enforcement policy prohibits the marketing of unapproved products as well as the marketing of approved products for unapproved  or off label  uses 
these regulations and the fda s interpretation of them may impair our ability to effectively market products for which we gain approval 
failure to comply with these requirements can result in federal and state regulatory enforcement action 
further  we may not obtain the labeling claims we believe are necessary or desirable for the promotion of our product candidates 
if we are unable to convince the fda to reverse its conclusion in its not approvable letter for mt  we will not receive any revenue from sales of mt in the united states 
on may   we received a not approvable letter from the fda with respect to our nda for mt in the letter  the fda noted that  although we had demonstrated unambiguous statistically significant superiority compared to an appropriate control on a valid measure of pain as well as on the three associated symptoms of nausea  photophobia and phonophobia in one study  mt did not clearly meet these criteria in a second study 
the fda letter cited the apparent lack of superiority of mt over naproxen for sustained pain relief  which was the primary endpoint for the two component studies 
the fda also stated in its letter that  based on animal studies  there may be a potential risk of carcinogenicity  presumably due to metoclopramide  one of the components of mt finally  the fda raised an approvability issue concerning the risk of tardive dyskinesia td presented by the use of metoclopramide 
since the issuance of the fda s not approvable letter  we have had continuing communications with the fda to seek to persuade the fda that mt should be approved based upon the data that we submitted in the nda for mt the fda and we have agreed to present mt data to an fda advisory committee 
the date of this meeting has not yet been scheduled 
we cannot predict the outcome of the meeting with the fda s advisory committee or whether the fda will follow the advisory committee s recommendations 
further  it is possible that we may be required to conduct another clinical study to provide additional evidence that mt meets the requirements of the combination rule and the efficacy standards applicable to mt the fda may also require that we conduct investigations to evaluate any potential risk of td with the use of mt we cannot estimate the cost or duration of any such studies or investigations or decide whether to conduct such studies or undertake such investigations until the results of the meeting with the fda s advisory committee are known and the design of any such studies and the parameters of such investigations have been determined with the fda 
our phase clinical trials of mt took between three months and eighteen months and involved a direct cost per patient of between  and  however  the duration and cost of any new study that we may conduct may be different from our prior clinical trials 
no assurance can be given that our efforts to obtain fda approval of mt will ultimately be successful 
without approval of our nda for mt by the fda  we would not be able to market mt in the united states 
even if the fda were to approve the nda for mt  the delay in obtaining such approval may adversely affect our ability to market and sell mt in the united states 
further  as an additional condition of any approval  the fda could request or require additional studies or analyses of existing data which would require us to incur additional costs and expenses  which could be significant and would further delay the commercialization of mt our failure to address satisfactorily the comments we received on our maa for mt in the uk would adversely impact our ability to market mt in the uk or to use the mutual recognition procedure in the european union 
even if we obtain required approvals  the need to appropriately price and obtain reimbursement for mt may adversely affect sales or cause delays 
in september  we received a letter of comments relating to the maa we submitted for mt from an mhra advisory 
the most significant comment in the mhra advisory committee s letter of comments was that we provide additional data to support the benefits of the combination of metoclopramide hydrochloride and naproxen sodium in mt we provided additional data and supplemental information to the mhra advisory committee in to address the mhra advisory committee s questions and  in january  the mhra advisory committee advised us in a letter that it was prepared to advise the mhra that a marketing authorization could be granted for mt in the uk  provided we supply certain additional information and meet certain conditions  as outlined by the mhra advisory committee 
the mhra is not bound by the mhra advisory committee s comments  and  although we believe we can address the requests of the mhra advisory committee as set forth in its letter to us  we can give no assurance that the mhra advisory committee will accept the supplemental information we supply or that the mhra will follow the mhra advisory committee s recommendations 
without approval of our maa in the uk by the mhra  we would not be able to market mt in the uk 
further  we would not be able to use the mutual recognition process to obtain approval of mt in other european union countries unless we first obtain approval in another country in the european union  which would result in increased expenses and time delays 
even if we are able to obtain approvals in the european union to market mt  potential licensees  including nycomed and any other party with whom we may enter into an agreement to commercialize mt  will not be able to sell mt 
table of contents successfully in some of those european union countries unless they price mt competitively and obtain necessary regulatory approvals for reimbursement to the patient 
in some countries  licensees would need to enter into discussions regarding pricing and reimbursement of mt with the appropriate governmental authorities pursuant to each of such country s individual requirements 
those discussions could further delay successful commercialization of mt because of the time consuming review processes in some of those countries 
if we are unable to convince the fda to reverse its conclusion in its not approvable letter for mt  we will not receive any revenue from sales of mt in the united states 
in october  we received a not approvable letter from the fda related to our nda for mt the letter was issued based on the fda s conclusion that we had not submitted substantial evidence of effectiveness for mt as an acute treatment for migraine 
the fda noted that  although mt provided a statistically significant improvement over placebo on the pre defined endpoint of sustained pain relief at hours post dose as well as relief of pain at two hours post dose  mt failed to achieve statistical significance versus placebo for the relief of all of the ancillary symptoms of migraine nausea  photophobia and phonophobia at two hours 
further  the fda noted that the incidence of nausea  one of the associated symptoms of migraine  was statistically significantly higher following mt treatment versus placebo at two hours 
since our receipt of the not approvable letter  we have had continuing communications with the fda regarding the mt nda and in a recent communication the fda restated its concerns that approval of mt was problematic due to the higher incidence of nausea at two hours following dosing in patients treated with mt compared with placebo 
no assurance can be given that our efforts to obtain fda approval of mt will ultimately be successful 
even if the fda were to approve mt  as a condition of approval  the fda could request or require additional studies or analyses of existing data which would require us to incur additional costs and expenses  which could be significant and would delay the commercialization of mt our need to collaborate with third parties to develop and commercialize our products may result in delays in product development and lost revenues  restricting our ability to commercialize our products 
under our current strategy  and for the foreseeable future  we expect to depend upon collaborations with third parties to develop our product candidates and we expect to depend substantially upon third parties to commercialize our products 
as a result  our ability to develop  obtain regulatory approval of  manufacture and commercialize our existing and any future product candidates depends upon our ability to maintain existing  and enter into and maintain new  contractual and collaborative arrangements with others 
we also engage  and intend in the future to continue to engage  contract manufacturers and clinical trial investigators 
in addition  the identification of new compounds or product candidates for development has led us  and may continue to require us  to enter into license or other collaborative agreements with others  including pharmaceutical companies and research institutions 
collaborative agreements for the acquisition of new compounds or product candidates may require us to pay license fees  make milestone payments and or pay royalties 
furthermore  these agreements may result in our revenues being lower than if we developed our product candidates ourselves and in our loss of control over the development of our product candidates 
contractors or collaborators may have the right to terminate their arrangements with us on limited or no notice and for reasons outside of our control 
we currently have a collaboration with gsk for the development and commercialization of certain triptan combinations using our mt technology in the united states and collaborations with nycomed in the nordic countries and xcel in the united states for the development and commercialization of mt and mt  respectively 
in all of these collaboration and license agreements  our licensees have the right to terminate the agreement upon a default by us 
in addition  gsk is entitled to terminate its agreement upon days notice for any reason  nycomed is entitled to terminate its agreement if the maa for mt is withdrawn and can terminate the applicability of the agreement to a particular country if we withdraw the required regulatory application in that country  and xcel is entitled to terminate its agreement if we choose to withdraw the nda for mt our receipt of not approvable letters for mt and mt may suggest to our collaborators that they should terminate their agreements with us 
if these licensees exercise their termination rights  or if these license agreements terminate because of delays in obtaining regulatory approvals  or for other reasons  and we are not able to establish replacement or additional research and development collaborations or licensing arrangements  we may not be able to develop and commercialize these and our other product candidates 
moreover  any future collaborations or license arrangements may not be on terms favorable to us 
a further risk we face with our collaborations is that business combinations and changes in the collaborators or their business strategy may adversely affect their willingness or ability to complete their obligations to us 
for example  in february  valeant reported that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire xcel and on march  reported that the acquisition had been completed 
we can give no assurance that xcel or valeant will elect to continue the collaboration with us on mt if our agreement with xcel is terminated for this or any other reason and we are unable to enter into a new collaboration agreement to replace the agreement with xcel  we may be unable to commercialize mt  assuming its eventual approval by the fda  and would never receive any further revenue from mt our current or any future collaborations or license arrangements ultimately may not be successful 
our agreements with collaborators typically allow them discretion in electing whether to pursue various regulatory  commercialization and other activities or with respect to the timing of the development  such as our agreement with gsk under which gsk determines  among other things  
table of contents the exact formulation and composition of the product candidates using our mt technology for use in the trexima clinical trials 
if any collaborator were to breach its agreement with us or otherwise fail to conduct collaborative activities in a timely or successful manner  the pre clinical or clinical development or commercialization of the affected product candidate or research program would be delayed or terminated 
any delay or termination of clinical development or commercialization would delay or eliminate our potential product revenues 
other risks associated with our collaborative and contractual arrangements with others include the following we may not have day to day control over the activities of our contractors or collaborators  third parties may not fulfill their regulatory or other obligations  we may not realize the contemplated or expected benefits from collaborative or other arrangements  and disagreements may arise regarding a breach of the arrangement  ownership of proprietary rights  clinical results or regulatory approvals 
these factors could lead to delays in the development of our product candidates and or the commercialization of our products  or could result in our not being able to commercialize our products 
further  disagreements with our contractors or collaborators could require or result in litigation or arbitration  which would be time consuming and expensive 
our ultimate success may depend upon the success and performance on the part of these third parties 
if we fail to maintain these relationships or establish new relationships as required  development of our product candidates and or the commercialization of our products will be delayed or may never be realized 
a collaborator may withdraw support or cease to perform work on our product candidates if the collaborator determines to develop its own competing product candidate instead 
we have entered into collaboration and license agreements  and expect to continue to enter into such agreements  with companies that have products and are developing new product candidates that compete or may compete with our product candidates 
if one of our collaborators should decide that the product or a product candidate that the collaborator is developing would be more profitable for the collaborator than our product candidate covered by the collaboration or license agreement  the collaborator may withdraw support for our product candidate or may cease to perform under our agreement 
in the event of a termination of the collaborator s agreement upon such cessation of performance  we would need to negotiate an agreement with another collaborator in order to continue the development and commercialization efforts for the product candidate 
if we were unsuccessful in negotiating another agreement  we might have to cease development activities of the particular product candidate 
our development and commercialization agreement with gsk is subject to this risk 
gsk has publicly disclosed that it is exploring the development of several early stage compounds for the treatment of migraine 
if gsk decides to focus its development and commercialization efforts on its own products rather than continuing to work with us on trexima or any other product candidates that may be developed under the agreement  it has the ability to terminate our agreement upon days written notice 
in such a case  we would need to enter into a new development and commercialization agreement and would need to start the development process all over again 
if we were able to negotiate a new development and commercialization agreement to develop our mt technology  which is not certain  we would face delays and redundant expenses in that development 
we need to maintain current agreements and enter into additional agreements with third parties that possess sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  or establish internally the capability to perform these functions  in order to successfully market and sell our future drug products 
we have no sales or distribution personnel or capabilities 
if we are unable to maintain current collaborations or enter into additional collaborations with established pharmaceutical or pharmaceutical services companies to provide those capabilities  or  alternatively  we are unable to develop internally sales and distribution capabilities  we will not be able to successfully commercialize our products 
to the extent that we enter into marketing and sales agreements with third parties  our revenues  if any  will be affected by the sales and marketing efforts of those third parties 
further  we cannot guarantee that  should we elect to develop our own sales and distribution capabilities  we would have sufficient resources to do so  or would be able to hire the qualified sales and marketing personnel we would need 
we need to conduct preclinical  toxicology  genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies and clinical trials for our product candidates 
any unanticipated results  unforeseen costs or delays in the conduct of these studies or trials  or the need to conduct additional studies or trials or to seek to persuade the fda to evaluate the results of a study or trial in a different manner  could reduce  delay or eliminate our receipt of revenues for one or more of our product candidates and adversely affect our ability to achieve profitability 
generally  we must demonstrate the efficacy and safety of our product candidates before approval to market can be obtained from the fda or the regulatory authorities in other countries 
our existing and future product candidates are and will be in various stages of clinical development 
depending upon the stage of the development process of a product candidate  we will need to complete preclinical  toxicology  genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies  as well as clinical trials  on these product candidates before we submit marketing applications in the united states and abroad 
these studies and trials can be very costly and time consuming 
in addition  we rely on third parties to perform significant aspects of our studies and clinical trials  introducing additional sources of risk into our development programs 

table of contents it should be noted that the results of our clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of results we will obtain in subsequent clinical trials 
this may occur for many reasons  including  among others  the variability of patient characteristics  including patient symptoms at the time of study treatment  the larger scale testing of patients in later trials  or differences in formulation or doses of the product candidate used in later trials 
for example  if we conduct an additional study to address the fda s concerns in its not approvable letter on mt  there is no assurance that the results of such a study will satisfy all of the fda s conditions for approval because  among other reasons  migraine affects patients differently  including the presence  or lack or level of severity  of secondary symptoms in a particular patient and the variability of the responsiveness of migraine attacks to given treatments  all of which may affect treatment responses 
in addition  our results from our first phase clinical trial of trexima differed from the results of the phase proof of concept trial of mt that we conducted prior to entering into our collaboration with gsk 
whereas in the phase trial statistical significance was reached at two hours over placebo in the relief of all associated symptoms of migraine nausea  photophobia and phonophobia  in the phase study trexima failed to achieve statistical significance at two hours compared to placebo in the relief of nausea 
the successful completion of clinical trials depends upon many factors  including the rate of enrollment of patients 
if we are unable to recruit sufficient clinical patients during the appropriate period  we may need to delay our clinical trials and incur significant additional costs 
we also rely on the compliance of our clinical trial investigators with fda regulatory requirements and noncompliance can result in disqualification of a clinical trial investigator and data that is unusable 
in addition  the fda or institutional review boards may require us to conduct additional trials or delay  restrict or discontinue our clinical trials on various grounds  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
for example  even though we are entitled to submit an nda for trexima as a b application  the fda may require us to conduct more studies or trials than we now believe are necessary 
further  even though we may have completed all planned clinical trials for a product candidate and submitted an nda for such product candidate  as we have for mt and mt  the fda may require us to conduct additional clinical trials  studies or investigations to support our ndas 
for example  the fda may require us to conduct additional studies or trials of mt or mt in connection with our efforts to convince the fda to reverse its not approvable decisions on these product candidates 
we may also determine from time to time  including in connection with our efforts to resolve the fda s issues raised in the not approvable letters related to mt and mt  that it would be necessary to seek to persuade the fda to evaluate the results of a study or trial in a manner that differs from the way the fda initially evaluated the results  or customarily evaluates results 
in addition  we may have unexpected results that require us to reconsider the need for certain studies or trials 
for example  results from a genotoxicity study involving mt may require us to conduct chronic toxicology and carcinogenicity studies 
once submitted  an nda requires fda approval before we can distribute or commercialize the product described in the application 
even if we determine that data from our clinical trials  toxicology  genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies are positive  we cannot assure you that the fda  after completing its analysis  will not determine that the trials or studies should have been conducted or analyzed differently  and thus reach a different conclusion from that reached by us  or request that further trials  studies or analyses be conducted 
for example  although we believe that we provided the necessary data to support approval of the ndas for mt and mt  the fda issued not approvable letters for the mt and mt ndas on may  and october   respectively 
further  although we believed the results of our recently completed mt two year rat carcinogenicity study provided no evidence that the concomitant administration of maximum tolerated doses of metoclopramide and naproxen  the two active components in mt  produced any statistically significant differences in the occurrences and types of tumors seen with metoclopramide alone  the fda expressed concern about the potential risk of carcinogenicity  presumably due to metoclopramide  in its mt not approvable letter 
the fda may also require further investigations to assess any potential risk of tardive dyskinesia associated with the use of mt the fda may also require data in certain subpopulations  such as pediatric use  or  if such studies were not previously completed  may require long term carcinogenicity studies  prior to nda approval  unless we can obtain a waiver of such a requirement 
we face similar regulatory hurdles in other countries to those that we face in the united states 
for example  no assurance can be given that the mhra will follow the mhra advisory committee s recommendation  of which we received notice in january  that marketing authorization be granted in the uk for mt  subject to our providing additional information and addressing certain matters set forth in our notice from the mhra advisory committee  or that we will be able to satisfactorily answer and or address such matters 
our costs associated with our human clinical trials vary based on a number of factors  including the order and timing of clinical indications pursued  the extent of development and financial support from collaborative parties  if any  the need to conduct additional clinical trials or studies  the number of patients required for enrollment  
table of contents the difficulty of obtaining sufficient patient populations and clinicians  the difficulty of obtaining clinical supplies of our product candidates  and governmental and regulatory delays 
we currently depend and will in the future depend on third parties to manufacture our product candidates 
if these manufacturers fail to meet our requirements or any regulatory requirements  the product development and commercialization of our product candidates will be delayed 
we do not have  and have no plans to develop  the internal capability to manufacture either clinical trial or commercial quantities of products that we may develop or have under development 
we rely upon third party manufacturers to supply us with our product candidates 
we also need supply contracts to sell our products commercially 
there is no guarantee that manufacturers that enter into commercial supply contracts with us will be financially viable entities going forward  or will not otherwise breach or terminate their agreements with us 
if we do not have the necessary commercial supply contracts  or if our current manufacturer is  or any of our future manufacturers are  unable to satisfy our requirements or meet any regulatory requirements  and we are required to find alternative sources of supply  there may be additional costs and delays in product development and commercialization of our product candidates or we may be required to comply with additional regulatory requirements 
if our competitors develop and commercialize products faster than we do or if their products are superior to ours  our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated 
our product candidates will have to compete with existing and any newly developed migraine therapies or therapies for any newly developed product candidates for the treatment of other diseases 
there are also likely to be numerous competitors developing new products to treat migraine and the other diseases and conditions for which we may seek to develop products in the future  which could render our product candidates or technologies obsolete or non competitive 
our primary competitors will likely include large pharmaceutical companies including  based upon their current migraine portfolios  gsk  merck co  medpointe pharmaceuticals  johnson johnson and pfizer  inc  biotechnology companies  universities and public and private research institutions 
based upon their migraine portfolios and the overall competitiveness of our industry  we believe that we face  and will continue to face  intense competition from other companies for securing collaborations with pharmaceutical companies  establishing relationships with academic and research institutions  and acquiring licenses to proprietary technology 
our competitors  either alone or with collaborative parties  may also succeed with technologies or products that are more effective than any of our current or future technologies or products 
many of our actual or potential competitors  either alone or together with collaborative parties  have substantially greater financial resources  and almost all of our competitors have larger numbers of scientific and administrative personnel than we do 
many of these competitors  either alone or together with their collaborative parties  also have significantly greater experience than we do in developing product candidates  undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials  obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals of product candidates  and manufacturing and marketing products 
accordingly  our actual or potential competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection  receiving fda or other regulatory approval or commercializing products before we do 
any delays we encounter in obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates  such as we are currently experiencing as a result of the not approvable letters we have received from the fda on mt and mt  increase this risk 
our competitors may also develop products or technologies that are superior to those that we are developing  and render our product candidates or technologies obsolete or non competitive 
if we cannot successfully compete with new or existing products  our marketing and sales will suffer and we may not ever receive any revenues from sales of products or may not receive sufficient revenues to achieve profitability 
if there is an adverse outcome in the securities class action or shareholder derivative lawsuits that have been filed against us or our current or former directors and officers  our business may be materially harmed 
further  defending against these lawsuits may be expensive and will divert the attention of our management 
four purported class action lawsuits claiming violations of securities laws were filed between june and july  in the us district court for the middle district of north carolina by holders of our securities against us and certain of our current and former officers 
these actions have been consolidated for pre trial purposes 
a fifth case filed on august  has also been consolidated with those actions for pre trial purposes 
by order dated november   the court appointed a lead plaintiff  who filed a consolidated amended complaint amended complaint on december  the defendants named in the amended complaint are pozen and john r 
plachetka  our chairman and chief executive officer 
the complaint alleges violations of federal securities laws  including violations of section b of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and rule b  and violations of section a of the exchange act against dr 
plachetka 
the amended complaint alleges that we made false and misleading statements 
table of contents concerning our product candidates mt and mt during the class period 
the amended complaint requests certification of a plaintiff class consisting of purchasers of our stock between october  and may  on january   we moved to dismiss the amended complaint 
in september  two derivative actions were filed against certain of our current and former directors and officers in the superior court for the county of orange in the state of north carolina 
these actions allege violations of state law  including breaches of fiduciary duties and insider sales  relating to the same allegedly misleading statements concerning the same product candidates mt and mt that are referenced in the various purported class action lawsuits 
the cases have been transferred to the north carolina business court 
as with any litigation proceeding  we cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of these pending lawsuits 
furthermore  we will have to incur expenses in connection with these lawsuits  which may be substantial 
in the event of an adverse outcome  our business could be materially harmed 
moreover  responding to and defending the pending litigation will result in a significant diversion of management s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees 
if we are unable to protect our patents or proprietary rights  or if we are unable to operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of others  we may be unable to develop our product candidates or compete effectively 
the pharmaceutical industry places considerable importance on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies  products and processes 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability  and the ability of our licensors  to obtain and to keep protection for our products and technologies under the patent laws of the united states and other countries  so that we can stop others from using our inventions 
our success also will depend on our ability to prevent others from using our trade secrets 
in addition  we must operate in a way that does not infringe  or violate  the patent  trade secret and other intellectual property rights of other parties 
we cannot know how much protection  if any  our patents will provide or whether our patent applications will issue as patents 
the breadth of claims that will be allowed in patent applications cannot be predicted and neither the validity nor enforceability of claims in issued patents can be assured 
if  for any reason  we are unable to obtain and enforce valid claims covering our products and technology  we may be unable to prevent competitors from using the same or similar technology or to prevent competitors from marketing identical products 
in addition  due to the extensive time needed to develop and test our products  any patents that we obtain may expire in a short time after commercialization 
this would reduce or eliminate any advantages that such patents may give us 
we may need to submit our issued patents for amendment or reissue if we determine that any claims within our patents should not have been issued 
while such a submission may be based on our view that only specified claims should not have been granted to us  there can be no assurance that a patent examiner will not determine that additional claims should not have been granted to us 
such a risk exists with one of our patents covering mt  which we submitted for reissue after determining that certain specified claims that are not central to our protection of mt should not have been issued 
a third party has recently filed a protest regarding the reissuance of that mt patent 
we do not know the weight the examiner will give to the protest or whether this may adversely affect our submission for reissuance of the patent 
we may need to license rights to third party patents and intellectual property to continue the development and marketing of our product candidates 
if we are unable to acquire such rights on acceptable terms  our development activities may be blocked and we may be unable to bring our product candidates to market 
we may enter into litigation to defend ourselves against claims of infringement  assert claims that a third party is infringing one or more of our patents  protect our trade secrets or know how  or determine the scope and validity of others patent or proprietary rights 
as a result of such litigation  our patent claims may be found to be invalid  unenforceable or not of sufficient scope to cover the activities of an alleged infringement 
if we are found to infringe the patent rights of others  then we may be forced to pay damages in an amount that might irreparably harm our business and or be prevented from continuing our product development and marketing activities 
even if we are successful in defending any such claims of infringement or in asserting claims against third parties  such litigation is expensive  may have a material effect on our operations  and may distract management from our business operations 
regardless of its eventual outcome  any lawsuit that we enter into may consume time and resources that would impair our ability to develop and market our product candidates 
we have entered into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  advisors and collaborators 
however  these parties may not honor these agreements and  as a result  we may not be able to protect our rights to unpatented trade secrets and know how 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and know how 
also  many of our scientific and management personnel were previously employed by competing companies 
as a result  such companies may allege trade secret violations and similar claims against us 
if we fail to acquire  develop and commercialize additional products or product candidates  or fail to successfully promote or market approved products  we may never achieve profitability 
as part of our business strategy  we plan to identify  self invent and or acquire product candidates or approved products in areas in which we possess particular knowledge 
because we do not directly engage in basic research or drug discovery  we may rely 
table of contents upon third parties to sell or license product opportunities to us 
other companies  including some with substantially greater financial  marketing and sales resources  are competing with us to acquire such products and product candidates 
we may not be able to acquire rights to additional products or product candidates on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  if we acquire new products or product candidates with different marketing strategies  distribution channels and bases of competition than those of our current product candidates  we may not be able to compete favorably in those product categories 
none of our future products may be accepted by the market 
even if our product candidates perform successfully in clinical trials and are approved by the fda and other regulatory authorities  our future products may not achieve market acceptance and may not generate the revenues that we anticipate 
the degree of market acceptance will depend upon a number of factors  including the receipt and timing of regulatory approvals  the availability of third party reimbursement  the indications for which the product is approved  the rate of adoption by healthcare providers  the rate of product acceptance by target patient populations  the price of the product relative to alternative therapies  the availability of alternative therapies  the extent and effectiveness of marketing efforts by us and third party distributors and agents  the existence of adverse publicity regarding our products or similar products  and the extent and severity of side effects as compared to alternative therapies 
if we do not receive adequate third party reimbursements for our future products  our revenues and profitability will be reduced 
our ability to commercialize our product candidates successfully will depend  in part  on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of such products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities  such as medicare and medicaid in the united states  private health insurers and other organizations 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of a newly approved healthcare product 
adequate third party coverage may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product research and development 
if adequate coverage and reimbursement levels are not provided by government and third party payors for use of our products  our products may fail to achieve market acceptance 
our future revenues  profitability and access to capital will be affected by the continuing efforts of governmental and private third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare through various means 
we expect that a number of federal  state and foreign proposals will seek to control the cost of drugs through governmental regulation 
we are unsure of the form that any healthcare reform legislation may take or what actions federal  state  foreign and private payors may take in response to any proposed reforms 
therefore  we cannot predict the effect of any implemented reform on our business 
if product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us  we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates 
the testing and marketing of pharmaceutical products entails an inherent risk of product liability 
product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers  healthcare providers  pharmaceutical companies or others selling our future products 
if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against such claims  we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit the commercialization of our product candidates 
we have product liability insurance that covers our human clinical trials in an amount equal to up to million annual aggregate limit with a million deductible per claim 
the amount of insurance that we currently hold may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that may occur 
however  insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive  and no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability 
we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for any of our products 
however  we may not be able to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing 
if a plaintiff brings a successful product liability claim against us in excess of our insurance coverage  if any  we may incur substantial liabilities and our business may be harmed or fail 
we may need additional funding and may not have access to capital 
if we are unable to raise capital when needed  we may need to delay  reduce or eliminate our product development or commercialization efforts 
we may need to raise additional funds to execute our business strategy 
we have incurred losses from operations since inception and we may continue to incur additional operating losses 
our actual capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the progress of our research and development programs  
table of contents the progress of preclinical studies  clinical and other testing or the need conduct additional trials  studies or other testing  the time and cost involved in obtaining any regulatory approvals  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the effect of competing technological and market developments  the timing of our receipt  if any  of milestone payments and royalties under collaborative agreements  the effect of changes and developments in  or termination of  our collaborative  license and other relationships  the terms and timing of any additional collaborative  license and other arrangements that we may establish  and our ability to arrange for the commercialization of our product candidates 
in addition  collaborative arrangements may require us to grant product development programs or licenses to third parties for products that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves which may increase our capital requirements 
for fiscal years through  our average annual operating expenses including average non cash deferred compensation of million were million 
we are currently expecting operating expenses for the fiscal year to be between million and million  excluding any non cash compensation expense that would result from the award of stock options upon the adoption of sfas r 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
if our operating expenses in and are at the level of our currently expected operating expenses in and if we do not receive any additional milestone payments under any of our collaboration agreements  we will not have sufficient cash reserves to maintain our level of business activities throughout further  our expenses might increase in and beyond currently expected levels if any regulatory agency requires us to conduct additional clinical trials  studies or investigations in connection with their consideration  or reconsideration  of our regulatory filings for mt  mt and trexima 
we may be unable to raise additional equity funds until the uncertainties of the regulatory future of mt and mt resulting from our receipt of not approvable letters for both product candidates have been resolved 
we may be unable to raise additional equity funds when we desire to do so due to unfavorable market conditions in our industry or generally  or other unforeseen developments in our business 
further  we may not be able to find sufficient debt or equity funding  if at all  on acceptable terms 
if we cannot  we may need to delay  reduce or eliminate research and development programs and therefore may not be able to execute our business strategy 
the sale by us of additional equity securities or the expectation that we will sell additional equity securities may have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel  which would harm our research and development efforts 
we are highly dependent on the efforts of our key management and scientific personnel  especially john r 
plachetka  pharmd  our chairman  president and chief executive officer 
dr 
plachetka signed an employment agreement with us on april   as amended and restated on july   for a three year term with automatic one year renewal terms 
we also entered into employment agreements with certain of our other key management personnel  which provides for one or two year terms with automatic one year renewal terms 
if we lose the services of dr 
plachetka  or are unable to replace the services of our key personnel who may leave the company  such as dr 
marshall e 
reese  executive vice president  product development  william l 
hodges  senior vice president finance and administration and chief financial officer  kristina m 
adomonis  senior vice president  business development  or dr 
w 
james alexander  senior vice president  product development  or if we fail to recruit other key scientific personnel  we may be unable to achieve our business objectives 
there is intense competition for qualified scientific personnel 
since our business is very science oriented  we need to continue to attract and retain such people 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for developing our business 
furthermore  our future success may also depend in part on the continued service of our other key management personnel and our ability to recruit and retain additional personnel  as required by our business 

table of contents factors that may affect our stockholders our stock price is volatile  which may result in significant losses to stockholders 
there has been significant volatility in the market prices of biotechnology companies securities and in the market price of our common stock 
various factors and events may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock including fluctuations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations  acquisitions or licensing of therapeutic products or product candidates by us or our competitors  published reports by securities analysts  positive or negative progress with our clinical trials or with regulatory approvals of our product candidates  governmental regulation  including reimbursement policies  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  developments in our relationships with collaborative partners  public concern as to the safety and or efficacy of our products or product candidates  and general market conditions 
the trading price of our common stock has been  and could continue to be  subject to wide fluctuations in response to these factors 
from october   when our common stock began trading on the nasdaq national market  through march   the high and low closing prices of our common stock ranged from to 
broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could depress our stock price 
we have not sold shares of common stock in a public offering since our initial public offering in october accordingly  we have a relatively small number of shares that are traded in the market and four of our stockholders beneficially hold approximately of our outstanding shares 
any sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  including sales or distributions of shares by our large stockholders  or the perception that such sales might occur  could harm the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could prevent or delay transactions that our stockholders may favor and may prevent stockholders from changing the direction of our business or our management 
provisions of our charter and bylaws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable  including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares  and may also frustrate or prevent any attempt by stockholders to change the direction or management of pozen 
for example  these provisions authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock without any need for action by stockholders  provide for a classified board of directors with staggered three year terms  require supermajority stockholder approval to effect various amendments to our charter and bylaws  eliminate the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  prohibit stockholder action by written consent  and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
further  in january our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan  similar to plans adopted by many other publicly traded companies 
the stockholder rights plan is intended to deter an attempt to acquire us in a manner or on terms not approved by our board of directors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the proceeds from our initial public offering  private placements and collaboration agreements have been invested in money market funds that invest primarily in short term  highly rated investments  including us government securities  commercial paper and certificates of deposit guaranteed by banks 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate changes 
because of the short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe that a decrease in market rates would have a significant negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio
