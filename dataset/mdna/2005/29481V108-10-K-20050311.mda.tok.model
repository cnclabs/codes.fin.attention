the following includes a number of forward looking statements  including  but not limited to  expectations for and beyond regarding performance under partnership arrangements  amortization of expense for software development costs and expected trends in revenues and expenses 
while such forward looking statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance  you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which apply only as of the date of this form k 
we use words such as anticipate  believe  expect  intend and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties such as competitive factors  technology development  market demand and our ability to obtain new contracts and accurately estimate net revenues due to variability in size  scope and duration of projects  and internal issues of the sponsoring client 
such risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or future predictions 
further information on potential factors that could affect our financial results can be found in this item under the caption risks related to our business 
overview we were founded in to provide cardiac safety services to evaluate the safety of new drugs 
we provide technology and services that enable the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device industries to collect  interpret and distribute cardiac safety and clinical data more efficiently 
we are a market leader in providing centralized electrocardiographic services cardiac safety services or expert ecg services and a leading provider of technology and services that streamline the clinical trials process by enabling our clients to evolve from traditional  paper based methods to electronic processing using our clinical data management products and services 
our solutions improve the accuracy  timeliness and efficiency of trial set up  data collection from sites worldwide and interpretation and new drug  biologic and device application submission 
we offer cardiac safety services  which are utilized by clinical trial sponsors and clinical research organizations cros during the conduct of clinical trials  including comprehensive thorough qtc studies 
services may be provided through the digital ecg franchise program  which offers a unique approach designed to address the growing capacity demands for ert s ecg services through partnerships with sponsors that desire dedicated resources within ert to address specific levels of cardiac safety monitoring transactions 
additionally  we offer the licensing and  at the client s option  hosting of our proprietary clinical data management software products and the provision of maintenance and consulting services in support of our proprietary clinical data management software products 
our license revenues consist of license fees for perpetual license sales and monthly and annual license sales 
our services revenues consist of cardiac safety services  technology consulting and training services and software maintenance services 
our site support revenue consists of cardiac safety equipment rentals and sales along with related supplies and freight 
we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and  while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions  there are agreements that contain multiple elements or non standard terms and conditions 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and  if so  how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements and when to recognize revenue for each element 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known  uncertainties regarding client acceptance are resolved and there are no client negotiated refund or return rights affecting the revenue recognized for delivered elements 
changes in the allocation of the sales price among the deliverable elements might impact the timing of revenue recognition  but would not change the total revenue recognized on the contract 
cost of licenses consists primarily of applications service provider asp fees for those clients that choose hosting  the cost of producing compact disks and related documentation and royalties paid to third parties in 
back to contents connection with their contributions to our product development 
cost of services includes the cost of cardiac safety services and the cost of technology consulting  training and maintenance services 
cost of cardiac safety services consists primarily of direct costs related to our centralized cardiac safety services and includes wages  depreciation and other direct operating costs 
cost of technology consulting  training and maintenance services consists primarily of wages  fees paid to outside consultants and other direct operating costs related to our consulting and client support functions 
cost of site support consists primarily of wages  cardiac safety equipment rent and depreciation  related supplies  cost of equipment sold  shipping expenses and other direct operating costs 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of wages and commissions paid to sales personnel  travel expenses and advertising and promotional expenditures 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and direct costs for our finance  administrative  corporate information technology and executive management functions  in addition to professional service fees and corporate insurance 
research and development expenses consist primarily of wages paid to our product development staff  costs paid to outside consultants and direct costs associated with the development of our technology products 
we conduct our operations through offices in the united states and the uk 
our international net revenues represented approximately  and of total net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenues are recognized where the work is performed and not based upon the location of the client or the study 
results of operations executive overview marked a year of continued growth and evolution 
revenue  net income and operating cash flow for the year all increased substantially over  despite continuing investment in product line extension for semi automated processing  increased sales and marketing expenditures  the impact of an increased tax rate and increased costs associated with expanding capabilities to meet the growth in cardiac safety service revenues and site support revenues 
in march  we were issued a united states patent for various methods and systems for processing electrocardiograms 
the methods and systems have particular utility in the collection and interpretation of electrocardiograms developed during clinical trials 
the patent includes more than claims directed to various features of our expert workflow enabled data handling technology 
during  we purchased over million shares of our stock for approximately million under a stock buy back program authorized by our board of directors  and we were still able to increase cash significantly from the end of regulatory bodies  such as the united states food and drug administration fda and the international conference on harmonization ich  provide guidance on the clinical trial process 
this guidance can have a significant influence on the decisions made by our clients and potential clients regarding the use of our services 
for example  in the june ich release  it was suggested that semi automated processing of electrocardiograms may be found acceptable in certain instances 
semi automated processing uses software algorithm placed measurements that are later adjudicated by a cardiac specialist or physician 
we have historically been a leader in the industry in manual processing and we now also provide semi automated processing with the same service level commitments to our customers as we have with our manual processing 
our manual processing includes manually derived measurements using our on screen  high resolution caliper placement system which are later interpreted by a cardiologist

back to contents the following table presents costs of revenues as a percentage of related net revenues and operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues year ended december  increase decrease cost of licenses cost of services cardiac safety technology consulting and training software maintenance total cost of services cost of site support total costs of revenues operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative research and development license revenues included an increase in revenue from the sale of perpetual licenses of million primarily due to the fact that the average license revenue for each of the perpetual licenses sold in generated license revenues substantially in excess of the average license revenue of the perpetual licenses sold in as a result of the mix of licenses sold and the number of users for each license 
additionally  there was an increase of approximately million in revenues for year ended december  versus the year ended december  for software licensed on a monthly and annual basis with new clients 
the increase in cardiac safety service revenues was primarily due to increased sales volume with both new and existing clients  including an increase in transactions performed  and a small increase in average revenue per transaction 
additionally  project assurance fees increased due to the fact that this fee was initiated during and that there was a greater percentage of active contracts that included this fee in the increase in sales volume in was partially attributed to an increase in comprehensive thorough qtc studies 
thorough qtc studies are typically of large volume and of short duration  with ecgs performed over a two to six month period 
as a result  revenues resulting from thorough qtc studies are more difficult to predict 
in addition  if drug sponsors shift towards semi automated processing using software algorithm placed measurements in place of our manual high resolution caliper placement system  more competitors may join our market  thus reducing pricing and our market share 
the effect of such action may reduce our average revenue per transaction 
technology consulting and training revenues decreased primarily due to a reduction in consulting on clinical data management software products as there were several large consulting engagements in with nothing of a comparable size in the decrease in consulting on clinical data management software products was partially offset by an increase in configuration fees related to reporting capabilities for cardiac safety clients 
the increase in software maintenance service revenues was primarily due to new perpetual license sales during the year ended december  site support revenue increased primarily due to revenue from the rental of cardiac safety equipment  which our clients use to perform cardiac safety procedures 
additionally  equipment sales totaled million in there were no significant equipment sales in we have seen increased interest from clients in purchasing equipment during which could indicate additional sales might occur in future periods 
the increase in the cost of cardiac safety services was primarily due to an increase in labor  depreciation and increased facilities and other costs associated with expanding capabilities to meet the growth in cardiac safety service revenues 
additionally  amortization expense related to internal use software costs was million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  see liquidity and capital resources for additional information related to internal use software 
the decrease in the cost of cardiac safety services as a percentage of cardiac safety service revenues was primarily due to the fact that some of the costs do not necessarily increase or decrease in direct relation with changes in revenue 

back to contents the decrease in the cost of technology consulting and training services  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of technology consulting and training service revenues  was due primarily to a reduction in third party consulting costs partially offset by an increase in labor costs in the year ended december  versus the year ended december  the reduction in consulting costs resulted from the decrease in revenue as well as staffing additions which allowed for most of the work  especially in the latter part of  to be completed by employees 
the increase in the cost of site support  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of site support revenues  was due primarily to an increase in rental and depreciation costs and supplies associated with cardiac safety rental equipment  cost of equipment sold in as there were no significant sales in  increased shipping costs and other costs associated with expanding capabilities to meet the growth in site support activities  including the addition of new dedicated site support facilities 
the increase in selling and marketing expenses was primarily due to increases in commissions that resulted from the increase in commissionable revenue  higher labor costs due to new hires  increased travel and entertainment and third party consulting costs 
these increased costs were partially offset by a reduction in bonuses due to higher targets in that were not fully achieved and savings resulting from not holding the annual users conference in the decrease in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total net revenues was primarily due to the increase in net revenues and the fact that selling and marketing expenses are discretionary in nature and can be increased or decreased as deemed necessary by management and do not necessarily increase or decrease with changes in revenues 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to consultants assisting with internal control work required by the sarbanes oxley act as well as increased audit and internal control attestation fees of our independent registered public accountants  higher labor costs due to new hires  increased legal fees  non income based taxes  depreciation  telecommunications  provision for uncollectible accounts  insurance costs and fees related to stock buybacks 
these increases were partially offset by foreign exchange gains  a planned reduction in public relations expenses and a reduction in incentive bonuses due to higher targets in that were not fully achieved 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues was primarily due to the increase in net revenues and the fact that general and administrative expenses do not necessarily increase or decrease with changes in revenues 
the decrease in research and development expenses  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of total net revenues  was due primarily to a reduction in labor costs resulting from a decrease in allocated administrative costs and the capitalization of expenditures related to internal use software development 
additionally  research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased due to the increase in net revenues and the fact that many of the research and development expenses do not necessarily increase or decrease with changes in revenues 
other income  net  consisted primarily of interest income realized from our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  net of interest expense related to capital lease obligations 
the primary reason for the increase in was higher balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in and a decrease in interest expense related to capital leases in our effective tax rate was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the tax rate increased primarily due to increased income before taxes with relatively static offsets such as tax credits for research and development 
as income increased  the impact of these tax offsets has decreased as a percentage of income before income taxes  and as a result  the effective tax rate has increased 
we expect this trend to continue in based on our preliminary assessment  as well as our review of other factors affecting our effective tax rate  we believe our effective tax rate will increase to approximately in additionally  as a percentage of total company operating income  the operating income generated in the united states has increased which results in higher taxes as the blended federal  state and local tax rate is higher than the uk tax rate

back to contents the following table presents costs of revenues as a percentage of related net revenues and operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues year ended december  increase decrease cost of licenses cost of services cardiac safety technology consulting and training software maintenance total cost of services cost of site support total costs of revenues operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative research and development the increase in license revenues was primarily due to an increase of million in software licensed on a monthly and annual basis with new clients and the sale of eleven perpetual licenses during the year ended december  versus five perpetual licenses during the year ended december   which resulted in an increase in revenues of million 
the increase in cardiac safety service revenues was primarily due to increased sales volume with both new and existing clients  including an increase in transactions performed 
additionally  the average revenue per transaction increased with a shift to digital ecg processing and the implementation of project assurance fees 
the increase in technology consulting and training service revenues was primarily due to increased consulting activities for new clients as well as increases in implementation fees from new licenses 
additionally  we initiated sales of validation and standard operating procedure guides in the increase in software maintenance service revenues was primarily due to new perpetual license sales during the year ended december  the increase in site support revenues was primarily due to increased volume which resulted in an increase in the rental of cardiac safety equipment  which our clients use to perform cardiac safety procedures 
additionally  equipment rental associated with the franchises that began in the third quarter of increased site support revenues 
the decrease in the cost of licenses  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of license revenues  was primarily due to a decrease in asp hosting fees associated with a change in asp hosting providers at the beginning of  including a termination fee paid to the previous asp hosting provider in additionally  the cost of licenses as a percentage of license revenues decreased due to the increase in revenue from perpetual licenses that have very little incremental cost of sales 
the increase in the cost of cardiac safety services was primarily due to an increase in labor  depreciation  facilities and other costs associated with expanding capabilities to meet the growth in cardiac safety service revenues 
we also began amortization of our internal use software costs during the third quarter of additional internal use software costs were capitalized throughout the remainder of and through the first quarter of we began amortizing the additional capitalized costs in the second quarter of we accelerated the amortization of certain internal use software costs due to an upgrade replacement that was scheduled to take place in the majority of these costs were to be amortized through august the increase in monthly amortization costs due to the acceleration was  commencing in the fourth quarter of and was to continue through march amortization expense related to internal use software costs was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the decrease in the cost of cardiac safety services as a percentage of cardiac safety service revenues was primarily due to the fact that some of the costs are fixed in nature 

back to contents the increase in the cost of technology consulting and training services  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of technology consulting and training service revenues  was due primarily to increased third party consulting and labor costs associated with the increase in technology consulting and training service revenues as well as increased bonuses due to improved performance during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the decrease in the cost of software maintenance services  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of software maintenance service revenues  was due primarily to a reduction in labor  office rent  depreciation and other costs during the year ended december  as a result of a proportional decrease in allocated costs relative to other cost centers 
the increase in the cost of site support  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of site support revenues  was primarily due to an increase in labor  rental and depreciation costs associated with cardiac safety rental equipment  and other costs associated with expanding capabilities to meet the growth in site support revenues 
the increase in selling and marketing expenses was due primarily to increases in commissions that resulted from the increase in commissionable revenue  bonuses due to improved performance during and labor costs 
these items were partially offset by planned reductions in advertising expense during the year ended december  the decrease in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total net revenues was primarily due to the increase in net revenues and the fact that many selling and marketing expenses are discretionary in nature and can be increased or decreased as deemed necessary by management and do not necessarily increase or decrease with changes in revenue 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to an increase in insurance  public relations  bonuses and payroll taxes related to stock option exercises during the year ended december  the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues was primarily due to the increase in net revenues and the fact that many of the general and administrative expenses are fixed in nature 
the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase in labor costs  third party consulting and bonuses during the year ended december  the decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of total net revenues was primarily due to the increase in net revenues and the fact that many of the research and development expenses are fixed in nature 
other income  net  consisted primarily of interest income realized from our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  net of interest expense related to capital lease obligations 
we recorded a net realized gain of million from the sale of our shares of digital angel corporation dac formerly known as medical advisory systems  inc during additionally  during  a gain of  was recognized on the sale of the domestic clinical research operation cro to scp communications  inc and  of interest income was recorded on the escrow accounts related to this sale 
in addition to the gain on the sale of the dac shares  the gain on sale of the domestic cro and the interest income earned on the escrow accounts  all of which were realized during  the decrease in other income  net was also due to lower interest rates during the year ended december  our effective tax rate was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in the tax rate was primarily due to the non recurring reversal of the valuation allowance related to certain state net operating loss carryforwards that was recorded in  the increase in the state tax effective rate and increased income before taxes with relatively static offsets such as tax credits for research and development of million 
as income increased  the impact of these tax offsets has decreased as a percentage of income before income taxes 
thus  the effective tax rate increased 
the tax rate was primarily impacted by the reversal of million of valuation allowances related to certain state net operating loss carryforwards 
revised outlook for quarter ending march  on march   we issued a press release updating our outlook for the quarter ending march  we anticipate that our revenues will be below the low end of our previous guidance range and that  due to the relatively fixed nature of the operating expenses  the percentage impact on earnings per share will be greater than on revenue 
there continues to be significant uncertainty in the clinical research and drug development industry  due in part to evolving regulatory guidance 
see risks related to our business 
back to contents extensive governmental regulation of the clinical trial process could require costly modifications to our products  adversely affect prospective clients willingness to use our products and could increase competition and reduce our market share 
we believe that this uncertainty continues to delay new contract signings and extend the time for initiation of new studies 
although we believe that further clarification of this regulatory guidance will be provided in the second quarter of and that the continued uncertainty that we believe has temporarily impacted our industry will be alleviated  our results of operations may continue to be adversely affected if this clarification is delayed or does not adequately address the uncertainty in the industry 
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december   our operations provided cash of million compared to million during the year ended december  the change was primarily the result of improved operating income  a smaller increase in accounts receivable due to the impact of franchise study activity which is largely prepaid and larger income tax benefits related to stock options recognized during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this change was partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other  accounts payable and accrued expenses 
for the year ended december   our investing activities used cash of million compared to million during the year ended december  the change was primarily the result of the net purchases of short term investments  which totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we capitalized million of property and equipment compared to million capitalized in the increase was primarily the result of increased purchases of cardiac safety rental equipment and related computer equipment during the current year 
this equipment was used to support the increased site support activity and contributed significantly to the increase in revenues in included in property and equipment is internal use software associated with the development of a data and communications management services software product expert used in connection with our centralized core cardiac safety electrocardiographic services 
we capitalize certain internal use software costs in accordance with statement of position the amortization is charged to the cost of cardiac safety services beginning at the time the software is ready for its intended use 
the initial development costs of expert were for the basic functionality required for this product 
additional development costs of expert were incurred to develop new functionalities and enhancements 
we started a new internal use software project to allow for semi automated processing of ecgs in the second quarter of and further enhancements were begun in october we also began capitalizing costs associated with an upgrade to expert beginning in the fourth quarter of in mid august of  we revised our estimated timing for the completion of the upgrade to expert 
we now expect to continue the development of the upgrade to expert through the fourth quarter of as opposed to the first quarter as we previously had estimated 
at this time  we expect to begin amortizing these costs during as this upgrade will replace many parts of the existing expert product we previously had accelerated the amortization of previously capitalized labor and consulting costs to fully amortize the associated costs of the existing expert product by the end of the first quarter of  which increased monthly amortization expense by  beginning in the fourth quarter of beginning in mid august of  we revised the amortization period for previously capitalized labor and consulting costs to fully amortize the associated costs of the existing expert product by the end of the fourth quarter of  which decreased monthly amortization expense by  beginning in mid august the start date is estimated and could be extended  which would result in a further decrease in the monthly amortization

at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the line 
we expect that existing cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs for at least the next year 
however  there may be acquisition and other growth opportunities that require additional external financing and we may from time to time seek to obtain additional funds from the public or private issuances of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that such financings will be available or available on terms acceptable to us

sfas no 
r is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
sfas no 
r requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees  but expresses no preference for a type of valuation model 
we currently use the intrinsic value method to measure compensation expense for stock based awards to our employees 
accordingly  we do not 
back to contents recognize any compensation expense related to stock option grants that we issue under our stock option plans 
under the new rules  we will be required to adopt a fair value based method for measuring the expense and this may materially impact our future reported results of operations 
sfas no 
r is effective for most public companies interim or annual periods beginning after june  we are evaluating the impact on our results from adopting sfas no 
r  but we expect it to be comparable to the pro forma effects of applying the original sfas no 
see note for further details 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
the requirements of fin for variable interest entities after january  were adopted on february  the adoption of fin did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  a modification of fin was issued fin r which delayed the effective date until no later than fiscal periods ending after march  and provided additional technical clarifications to implementation issues 
we currently do not have any variable interest entities as defined in fin r

 which is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies in december and december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
our significant accounting policies are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
however  the following policies could be deemed to be critical within the sec definition 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues primarily from three sources license fees  services and site support 
our license revenues consist of license fees for perpetual license sales and monthly and annual license sales 
our services revenues consist of cardiac safety services  technology consulting and training services and software maintenance services 
our site support revenues consist of cardiac safety equipment rental and sales  supplies and freight 
we recognize software revenues in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position accordingly  we recognize up front license fee revenues under the residual method when a formal agreement exists  delivery of the software and related documentation has occurred  collectability is probable and the license fee is fixed or determinable 
we recognize monthly and annual license fee revenues over the term of the arrangement 
hosting service fees are recognized evenly over the term of service 
cardiac safety services revenues consist of revenues that we provide on a fee for services basis and are recognized as services are performed 
the rental of cardiac safety equipment is recognized over the rental period 
sales of equipment and supplies are recognized at the time of sale 
we recognize revenues from software maintenance contracts on a straight line basis over the term of the maintenance contract  which is typically twelve months 
we provide consulting and training services on a time and materials basis and recognize revenues as we perform the services 
at the time of the transaction  management assesses whether the fee associated with our revenue transactions is fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
the assessment of whether the fee is fixed or determinable is based upon the payment terms of the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms or upon implementation or client acceptance  the fee is 
back to contents accounted for as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  revenue is recognized as the fees become due or after implementation or client acceptance has occurred 
collectability is assessed based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the client and the credit worthiness of the client 
if it is determined that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  the fee is deferred and revenue is recognized at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
under a typical contract for cardiac safety services  clients pay us a portion of our fee for these services upon contract execution as an upfront deposit  some of which is typically nonrefundable upon contract termination 
revenues are then recognized under cardiac safety service contracts as the services are performed 
for arrangements with multiple deliverables where the fair value of each element is known  the revenue is allocated to each component based on the relative fair values of each element 
for arrangements with multiple deliverables where the fair value of the delivered element is not known  revenue is allocated to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method provided that the fair value of all undelivered elements is known 
fair values for undelivered elements are based primarily upon stated renewal rates for future products or services 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves management having to estimate our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
management must then assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent that management believes that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
to the extent management establishes or increases a valuation allowance in a period  the consolidated statement of operations will reflect additional income tax expense 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred taxes and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had a valuation allowance of million primarily related to the realization of certain deferred tax assets 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
depreciation and amortization of long lived assets we compute depreciation on our property  plant and equipment on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives generally ranging from two to five years 
leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining lease term 
system development costs are amortized on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of four years or less if an upgrade replacement is expected to take place prior to the end of the four year period 
changes in the estimated useful lives of property  plant and equipment could have a material effect on our results of operations 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  which begin on page f of this form k  and contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
risks related to our business the risk factors identified in the cautionary statements below could cause our actual results to differ materially from those suggested in the forward looking statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
however  these risk factors are not exhaustive  as new risks emerge from time to time  and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors or to assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those 
back to contents contained in any forward looking statements 
accordingly  forward looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results 
extensive governmental regulation of the clinical trial process could require costly modifications to our products  adversely affect prospective clients willingness to use our products and services and could increase competition and reduce our market share 
we may incur increased expenses or suffer a reduction in revenues if our products and services do not comply with applicable government regulations or if regulations allow more competition in the market place 
the fda has published regulations and guidelines addressing a broad range of matters relating to the use of computerized systems to collect  manage and analyze data from clinical trials 
moreover  electronic data entry  management and analysis of medical information pertaining to subjects in clinical trials will be subject to state and federal government regulations that are not yet finalized 
conforming our products and services to these guidelines or to future changes in regulation could substantially increase our expenses 
in the united states and in foreign countries  regulatory authorities have also established other standards for conducting clinical trials leading to the approval of new products with which we must comply 
we are subject to these regulations because our products and services assist sponsors and cros in conducting trials and preparing new drug or device applications 
if a regulatory authority concludes that trials were not conducted in accordance with established requirements  it may take a variety of enforcement actions depending upon the nature of the violation and the applicable country 
in the united states  these measures may range from issuing a warning letter or seeking injunctive relief or civil penalties to recommending criminal prosecution  which could result in a prohibition of our continued participation in future clinical trials 
in november  the fda held a public meeting at which it proposed requiring sponsors of new drugs to submit ecg raw data in digital format and annotated digital ecg waveforms 
annotated waveforms include definition of measurement points that are used to create ecg analysis data 
a more recent meeting held in january  which was supported by a preliminary concept paper issued in november  further discussed the trial design  ecg acquisition  analysis and reporting for digital ecgs 
following a meeting in june  the international conference on harmonization ich released to the public in september the following guidelines at step  sb safety pharmacology studies for assessing the potential for delayed ventricular repolarization qt interval prolongation by human pharmaceuticals and e the clinical evaluation of qt qtc interval prolongation and proarrhythmic potential for non antiarrhythmic drugs 
the objective of these guidelines is to recommend the design and timing of studies in the clinical development process and provide general recommendations on available non clinical methodologies to assess the potential risk of qt interval prolongation of a pharmaceutical product 
at step  the guideline is under regulatory consideration by the three regions us  eu and japan 
the fda and ich are scheduled to meet in april and may  respectively 
we believe that  as a result of these meetings  the regulators will reinforce the importance of cardiac safety testing in clinical trials and will further clarify the regulatory guidance last provided in september there is currently no defined timeline for completion of step adoption of a tripartite harmonized text and step implementation by regulatory regions 
the results of the non clinical studies outlined in these guidelines contribute to the design and evaluation of clinical trials to determine the potential risk of qt prolongation in humans 
as a result  the evaluation methodology and trial designs supported by ert will be driven by the outcomes of these non clinical studies 
our clients and prospective clients will be less likely to use our products and services if the products and services do not comply with regulatory requirements in all countries where clinical trials are expected to take place or if we are precluded from participating in clinical trials in countries where trials will be conducted 
in addition  changing regulatory requirements could provide an advantage to our competitors if our competitors are able to meet the requirements more rapidly or at less cost 
for example  in the september ich release  it was suggested that semi automated processing of electrocardiograms may be found acceptable in certain instances 
semi automated processing uses software algorithm placed measurements that are later adjudicated by a cardiac specialist or physician 
while we are positioned to provide semi automated processing  we have historically been a leader in the industry in manual processing 
our manual processing includes manually derived measurements using our on screen  high resolution caliper placement system which are later interpreted by a cardiologist 
if drug sponsors shift towards semi automated processing  more competitors are likely to compete 
back to contents with us in offering this service and more competitors may join our market  thus potentially reducing pricing and our market share 
the effect of such actions may reduce our revenue and gross profit per transaction 
our results of operations in the quarter ended september  and for fiscal were adversely affected by the uncertainty in the clinical research and drug development industry that is due in part to this evolving regulatory guidance  and we anticipate that our results of operations for the quarter ending march  will also be adversely affected by this continued uncertainty 
our failure to maintain revenue and gross profit per transaction may affect our ability to achieve growth in cardiac safety revenues from year to year 
if we fail to show growth in cardiac safety revenues  we may not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which would likely cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
we have several large clients from whom we derive substantial revenue and therefore the loss of even a few of our clients could significantly reduce our revenues 
we have one client representing more than of our total revenues for if we lose this client or other significant clients and do not replace them with new clients  our revenues will decrease and may not be sufficient to cover our costs 
we currently derive and expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of clients 
consolidation among our clients could cause us to lose clients  decrease the market for our products and result in a reduction of our revenues 
our client base could decline because of consolidation  and we may not be able to expand sales of our products and services to new clients 
in addition  our profitability will suffer if we reduce our prices in response to competitive pressures without achieving corresponding reductions in our expenses 
consolidation in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device industries and among cros has accelerated in recent years  and we expect this trend to continue 
in addition  new companies or organizations that result from such consolidation may decide that our products and services are no longer needed because of their own internal processes or the use of alternative systems 
as these industries consolidate  competition to provide products and services to industry participants will become more intense and the importance of establishing relationships with large industry participants will become greater 
these industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price reductions for our products and services 
also  if consolidation of larger clients occurs  the combined organization may represent a larger percentage of business for us and  as a result  we are likely to rely more significantly on the combined organization s revenues to continue to achieve growth 
if clinical trial sponsors and cros do not shift from their existing paper based methods of collecting and managing clinical trial data to an electronic system  we may not achieve the market penetration necessary to grow the business at expected levels 
if participants conducting clinical trials are unwilling to adopt our technology solutions and new ways of conducting business  our revenues may not be sufficient to maintain the expected growth rate of securities analysts and investors 
our efforts to establish a standardized  electronic process to collect  manage and analyze clinical trial and cardiac safety data are a significant departure from the traditional clinical research process 
we estimate that the majority of clinical trials today use manual  paper based data entry  management and analysis tools 
each clinical trial can involve a multitude of participants  including the sponsor  a cro  regional site managers  investigators and patients 
with so many participants involved in a clinical trial  it may be difficult to convince a sponsor or cro to accept new methods of conducting a clinical trial 
we may not be successful in persuading these participants to change the manner in which they have traditionally operated and to accept our products and services 
while we saw some willingness from drug developers to shift from paper based methods during  the adoption is slow 
if general economic conditions worsen  potential clients may be unwilling to make large capital software purchases or commitments  which could affect our ability to maintain and or increase license revenues 
we have seen some resistance by potential clients in making the necessary large capital expenditure to license our software through our traditional one time license offering 
despite our efforts to market an annual or 
back to contents otherwise recurring term license  our failure to continue selling one time software licenses in the near term may affect our ability to achieve growth in license revenues from year to year 
if we fail to show growth in license revenues  we may not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which would likely cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
in addition  if we are not successful in selling recurring licenses  we will not generate the volume of recurring revenues in the future that we are expecting 
we may fail to maintain revenue and income growth 
if we do not maintain revenue and income growth  our stock price is likely to decline and we may not be able to continue to operate 
failure to maintain expected growth in profitability could reduce our cash reserves  cause the market price of our common stock to decline and ultimately cause us to discontinue operating our business 
our future operating results are uncertain and may fluctuate 
if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  our stock price would likely decline 
if our operating results in any future period fluctuate significantly  we may not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which would likely cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
it is difficult to predict the timing or amount of our revenues because we generate a significant percentage of our revenues from a limited number of clients our sales cycles can be lengthy and variable thorough qtc studies are typically of large volume and of short duration sponsors and cros may unexpectedly cancel  postpone or reduce the size of clinical trials we make decisions on operating expenses based on anticipated revenue trends and available resources 
we also incur expenses educating and providing information to our client base  including through consultations  without any obligation by our client to purchase our products and services 
because many of our expenses are fixed and we are committed to making a significant investment in our organization and in marketing our products and services  delays in recognizing revenues could cause our operating results to fluctuate from period to period 
in october  we announced that we would not meet previously stated guidance for the third quarter of and in march  we announced that we anticipated we would be significantly below our previously stated guidance for the quarter ending march  if we fail to generate the contract signings that we expect  we may fail again to meet financial guidance that we have provided  or may provide in the future  to the public 
we depend entirely on the clinical trial market and a downturn in this market could cause our revenues to decrease 
our business depends entirely on the clinical trials that pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device companies conduct 
our revenues will decline if there is less competition in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology or medical device industries  which would result in fewer products under development and decreased pressure to accelerate a product approval 
our revenues will also decline if the fda or similar agencies in foreign countries loosen their requirements  thereby decreasing the complexity of conducting clinical trials 
any other developments that adversely affect the pharmaceutical  biotechnology or medical device industries generally  including product liability claims  new technologies or products or general business conditions  could also decrease the volume of our business 
in the third quarter of  three studies were delayed or postponed  resulting in lower than expected revenues and earnings 
we could experience this again in the future if there are developments in the clinical trial market that causes a delay in studies 
our failure to expand our business or manage growth successfully could disrupt our business operations  increase our costs and delay implementation of our business strategies 
difficulties in managing our future growth could disrupt our business operations  increase our costs and delay achievement of our business goals  making it more difficult for us to maintain profitability 
our growth strategy depends on our ability to expand and improve our field sales  marketing and services organization  our operations and our corporate and administrative organizations  both in the united states and throughout the 
back to contents world 
in order to grow  we will need to hire additional personnel 
there are a limited number of experienced personnel with an adequate knowledge of our industry  and competition for their services is intense 
in addition  we may not be able to project the rate or timing of increases in the use of products and services accurately or to expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate the increases 
the expansion of our foreign operations also will require us to assimilate differences in foreign business practices  overcome language barriers and hire and retain qualified personnel abroad 
our failure to establish and maintain strategic alliances may delay the development of our products and services  cause us to lose clients and prevent us from growing our business  any of which could cause our stock price to decline 
we have relationships with providers of clinical pharmacology services  hardware and software systems  telecommunications  web hosting and development  systems integration and website content that support our sales and marketing efforts by satisfying other needs of our existing clients that our solutions do not address and by providing us access to their clients as potential sources of new business 
we do not generally have long term contracts with our strategic partners  so they may cease doing business with us on relatively short notice 
we have three franchise agreements that expire in may  august and december  respectively 
there is no assurance that we will extend these agreements beyond their existing terms 
we may not be successful in competing against others providing similar products and services  which could reduce our revenues and market share 
if our products and services do not achieve widespread acceptance by our clients  our revenues and market share will likely decline 
our competitors include other centralized cardiac safety laboratories  cros  software vendors  and clinical trial data service companies 
our targeted clients  sponsors and cros  may decide to choose other technology based products and services generated internally by them or from another source 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources  greater name recognition and more extensive client bases than we do 
in addition  many competitors focus their efforts on providing software or services for discrete aspects of the clinical trials process and may compare favorably to us on those discrete aspects 
further  certain drug development organizations may decide not to outsource all or a significant portion of the cardiac safety activities associated with their clinical research programs  which could reduce our revenues and market share 
we may incur liability as a result of providing cardiac safety analysis and interpretation services 
we provide centralized analysis and interpretation of ecgs in connection with our clients clinical trials 
it is possible that liability may be asserted against us and the physicians who interpret the ecgs for us for failing to accurately diagnose a medical problem indicated by the ecg or for failing to disclose a medical problem to the investigator responsible for the subject being tested 
in april  an action was initiated  naming both our company and one of our physicians who was contracted by us to interpret ecgs during the relevant period  alleging we were negligent in the treatment of one of the plaintiffs  who was a participant in a clinical trial for which we provided services 
see item  legal proceedings 
if we are found liable in this action or any other action that may be initiated in the future  we may be forced to pay fines and damages and to discontinue a portion of our operations 
the contractual protections included in our client contracts and our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to protect us against such liability 
if the protections are not adequate  we may be unable to achieve or maintain profitability and our stock price would likely fall 
the cardiac safety equipment that we own and lease could become obsolete due to technological advances or we may not be able to provide the quantity of equipment needed to service our clients 
we own and lease equipment  which we provide to our clients to perform cardiac safety procedures 
this equipment may become obsolete due to advances in technology and the introduction of newer equipment models prior to the time that we have fully depreciated the asset or fulfilled our lease obligations 
this could result in us recording additional expense to write off the book value or the remaining lease value of the equipment 
we are also dependent on a limited number of suppliers to provide the equipment necessary to service our clients and if adequate equipment is not available we may lose clinical clients resulting in reduced revenues 

back to contents system failures or capacity constraints could result in the loss of or liability to clients  which could reduce our revenues and increase our expenses 
if our clients experience any significant level of problems with our technology  we may become liable to those clients  we may be unable to persuade our clients to change from a manual  paper based process and we may lose clients 
the success of our products and services depends on the ability to protect against software or hardware malfunctions that interrupt operation of our applications or cause loss of data integrity power loss or telecommunications failures overloaded systems human error natural disasters in addition  when we offer our software products as an application service provider  our network infrastructure may be vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins and similar disruptive problems caused by our clients or other internet users 
this could also lead to delays  loss of data  interruptions or cessation of service to our clients for which we may be liable 
there is no current technology that provides absolute protection against these events 
in addition  we may find that the cost to develop or incorporate technology into our products that provides the maximum protection against these problems outweighs the incremental benefits of providing such enhanced protection 
our software products are complex and may contain undetected software errors  which could lead to an increase in our costs or a reduction in our revenues 
the occurrence of hardware and software errors  whether caused by our solutions or another vendor s products  could cause sales of our solutions to decrease and our revenues to decline cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs divert the attention of our technical personnel away from product development efforts cause significant client relations problems complex software products such as those included in our technology solutions frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or as new versions are released 
in addition  we combine our solutions with software and hardware products from other vendors 
as a result  we may experience difficulty in identifying the source of an error 
rapidly changing technology may impair our ability to develop and market our solutions and cause us to become less competitive 
our failure to continuously offer competitive products and services could cause us to lose clients and prevent us from successfully marketing our solutions to prospective clients 
as a result  our revenues would likely decline 
because our business relies on technology  we are susceptible to rapid technological change changing client needs frequent new product introductions evolving industry standards as the internet  computer and software industries continue to experience rapid technological change  we must quickly modify our solutions to adapt to such changes 
the demands of operating in such an environment may delay or prevent our development and introduction of new or enhanced products and services that 
back to contents continually meet changing market demands and that keep pace with evolving industry standards 
we have experienced development delays in the past and may experience similar or more significant delays in the future 
in addition  competitors may develop products superior to our solutions  which could make our products obsolete 
we depend on certain key executives  the loss of whom could disrupt our operations  cause us to incur additional expenses and or impede our ability to expand our operations 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key executives could negatively affect our ability to achieve our business goals 
our future performance will depend significantly on the continued service and performance of all of our executives  particularly dr 
joel morganroth  our chairman of the board of directors and chief scientist  and mr 
joseph a 
esposito  our president and chief executive officer 
we also depend on our key technical  client support  sales and other managerial employees 
we believe that it would be costly and time consuming to find suitable replacements for these employees 
if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology or maintain our technological advantages  we may lose our intellectual property rights and become less competitive 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property from infringement  other companies may use our intellectual property to offer competitive products at lower prices 
if we fail to compete effectively against these companies  we could lose clients and experience a decline in sales of our solutions and revenues 
to protect our intellectual property rights  we rely on a combination of copyright and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure 
in addition  in we were issued a us patent on over claims directed to various features of ert s expert workflow enabled data handling technology 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products and technology 
in addition  our us patent could be successfully challenged as invalid 
monitoring unauthorized use of our solutions is difficult and the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
third parties may claim that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights  which could result in the loss of our rights  subject us to liability and divert management attention 
although we are not currently involved in any intellectual property litigation  we may be a party to litigation in the future either to protect our intellectual property or as a result of an alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property of others 
these claims and any resulting litigation could subject us to significant liability or invalidate our ownership rights in the technology used in our solutions 
as a result  we may have to stop selling our solutions 
litigation  regardless of the merits of the claim or outcome  could consume a great deal of our time and money and would divert management time and attention away from our core business 
any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following stop using the challenged intellectual property or selling our products or services that incorporate it obtain a license to use the challenged intellectual property or to sell products or services that incorporate it  which could be costly or unavailable redesign those products or services that are based on or incorporate the challenged intellectual property  which could be costly and time consuming or could adversely affect the functionality and market acceptance of our products if we must take any of the foregoing actions  we may be unable to sell our solutions  which would substantially reduce our revenues 
third parties have made claims for damages against the company and may continue to do so  which could result in an unfavorable settlement or judgment against us 
we are currently named as a defendant in certain actions for damages 
although we believe the claims against us are meritless and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves  we may be unsuccessful in our defense efforts  which would result in unfavorable settlement costs or monetary judgments against us 
litigation  
back to contents regardless of the merits of the claim or outcome  consumes a great deal of our time and money and often diverts management time and attention away from our core business 
in addition  unsuccessful litigation could reduce our cash reserves  cause the market price of our common stock to decline and ultimately cause us to discontinue operating our business 
our international operations expose us to additional risks 
a key element of our business strategy is to expand our international operations 
we face a number of risks and expenses that are inherent in operating in foreign countries and  accordingly  our international operations may not achieve profitability consistently each year 
the risks to us from our international operations include government regulations trade restrictions burdensome foreign taxes exchange rate controls and currency exchange rate fluctuations political and economic instability varying technology standards difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations we are subject to a variety of government regulations in the countries where we market our products and services 
we currently operate in the united kingdom through a foreign subsidiary and may operate in other countries through additional foreign subsidiaries 
if we form foreign subsidiaries outside of the united kingdom  we may need to withhold taxes on earnings or other payments they distribute to us 
generally  we can claim a foreign tax credit against our federal income tax expense for these taxes 
however  the united states tax laws have a number of limitations on our ability to claim that credit or to use any foreign tax losses  which could result in higher payment by us of taxes in the united states 
we may also need to include our share of our foreign earnings in our income even if the subsidiaries do not distribute money to us 
as a result  less cash would be available to us in the united states 
our global operations may involve transactions in a variety of currencies 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could reduce our reported revenues or increase our reported expenses 
we currently do not utilize hedging investments 
the agreements that we sign with clients outside the united states may be governed by the laws of the countries where we provide our products and services 
we may also need to resolve any disputes under these agreements in the courts or other dispute resolution forums in those countries 
this could be expensive or could distract management s attention away from our core business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary financial market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk we generally place our investments in money market funds  municipal securities  bonds of government sponsored agencies  certificates of deposit with fixed rates with maturities of less than one year  and ap rated commercial bonds and paper 
we actively manage our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments  but in order to ensure liquidity  will only invest in instruments with high credit quality where a secondary market exists 
we have not held and do not hold any derivatives related to our interest rate exposure 
due to the average maturity and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio 
management estimates that had the average yield of our investments decreased by basis points  our interest income for the year ended december  would have decreased by approximately million 
this estimate assumes that the decrease occurred on the first day of and reduced the yield of each investment by basis points 
the impact on our future interest income of future 
back to contents changes in investment yields will depend largely on the gross amount of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
see liquidity and capital resources as part of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
foreign currency risk we operate on a global basis from locations in the united states and the united kingdom 
all international net revenues are billed and expenses incurred in either us dollars or pounds sterling 
as such  we face exposure to adverse movements in the exchange rate of the pound sterling 
as the currency rate changes  translation of the income statement of our uk subsidiary from the local currency to us dollars affects year to year comparability of operating results 
we do not hedge translation risks because any cash flows from uk operations are generally reinvested in the uk 
management estimates that a change in the exchange rate of the pound sterling would have impacted the reported operating income for the year ended december  by less than million
