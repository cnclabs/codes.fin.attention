licensing  in addition to creating revenue and return on engineering investment in market segments we choose not to address  creates products complementary and in some cases competitive to our own that expand the markets for our products and help to improve industry wide interoperability 
silicon image is a leader in the global pc and digital display arena with its innovative panellink branded digital interconnect technology  which enables an all digital connection between pc host systems  such as pc motherboards  graphics add in boards  notebook pcs and digital displays such as lcd monitors  plasma displays and projectors 
silicon image s panellink technology serves as the basis for both the dvi standard as well as for the popular hdmi standard  designed for ce applications 
together  silicon image s panellink dvi and hdmi solutions are the most popular dvi and hdmi implementation in the market with more than million units shipped to date 
in  in order to decrease our dependence on the pc business  we embarked upon a plan to diversify into the ce and storage markets 
products sold into the pc market have been declining as a percentage of our total revenues and generated of our revenue in  of our revenue in  and of our revenues in  if we include licensing revenues  these percentages would be   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
leveraging our core technology and standards setting expertise  silicon image is a leading force in advancing the adoption of hdmi  the digital audio and video interface standard for the consumer electronics market

hdmi enables the distribution of uncompressed  high definition video and multi channel audio in a single  all digital interface that dramatically improves quality and simplifies cabling 
based on the same core technology used by the dvi standard  silicon image s hdmi technology is also marketed under the panellink brand and includes high bandwidth digital content protection hdcp  which is supported by hollywood studios as the technology of choice for the secure distribution of premium content over uncompressed digital connections 
silicon image shipped the first hdmi compliant silicon to the market and currently remains the market leader for hdmi functionality 
products sold into the ce market have been increasing as a percentage of our total revenues and generated  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively if we include licensing revenues  these numbers would be   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
our ce products offer a secure interface for transmission of digital video and audio to consumer devices  such as digital tvs  hdtvs  a v receivers  stbs  and dvd players 
demand for our products will be driven primarily by the adoption rate of the hdmi standard within these product categories 
in the storage market  silicon image has assumed a leadership role in sata  the new high bandwidth  point to point interface that is replacing parallel ata in desktop storage and making inroads in the enterprise arena due to its improved price performance 
silicon image is a leading supplier of discrete sata devices with multiple motherboard and add in card design wins 
silicon image s satalink tm branded solutions are fully sata compliant and offer advanced features and capabilities such as native command queuing  port multiplier capability and atapi support 
silicon image also supplies high performance  low power fibre channel serializer deserializer serdes to leading switch manufacturers 

table of contents in september  silicon image introduced its first products based on its steelvine tm storage architecture that is expected to serve the storage needs of the smb and consumer electronics markets with a system on a chip implementation that includes a high speed five port switch  two micro processors  firmware and the sata interface  among other features 
products sold into the storage market  as a percentage of our total revenues  generated   and of our revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively if we include licensing revenues  these numbers were   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
demand for our storage semiconductor products is dependent upon the rate at which interface technology transitions from parallel to serial  market acceptance of our steelvine tm architecture  and the extent to which sata and fibre channel functionality are integrated into chipsets and controllers offered by other companies  which would make our discrete devices unnecessary 
in the first quarter of  we anticipate our legacy storage semiconductor business  fibre channel  and parallel ata revenues to decrease and our serial ata and steelvine revenues to increase 
license revenue is recognized when an agreement with a licensee exists  the price is fixed or determinable  delivery or performance has occurred  and collection is reasonably assured 
generally  we expect to meet these criteria and recognize revenue at the time we deliver the agreed upon items 
however  we may defer recognition of revenue until cash is received if collection is not reasonably assured at the time of delivery 
a number of our license agreements require customer acceptance of deliverables  in which case we would defer recognition of revenue until the licensee has accepted the deliverables and either payment has been received or is expected within approximately days of acceptance 
certain licensing agreements provide for royalty payments based on agreed upon royalty rates 
such rates can be fixed or variable depending on the terms of the agreement 
the amount of revenue we recognize is determined based on a time period or on the agreed upon royalty rate  extended by the number of units shipped by the customer 
to determine the number of units shipped  we rely upon actual royalty reports from our customers when available and rely upon estimates in lieu of actual royalty reports when we have a sufficient history base of receiving royalties from a specific customer to make an estimate based on available information from the licensee such as quantities held  manufactured and other information 
these estimates for royalties necessarily involve the application of management judgment 
as a result of our use of estimates  period to period numbers are trued up in the following period to reflect actual units shipped 
to date  such true up adjustments have not been significant 
in cases where royalty reports and other information are not available to allow us to estimate royalty revenue  we recognize revenue only when royalty payments are received 
development revenue is recognized when project milestones have been completed and acknowledged by the other party to the development agreement and collection is reasonably assured 
in certain instances  we recognize development revenue using the lesser of non refundable cash received or the results of using a proportional performance measure 
our licensing activity is complementary to our product sales and it helps us to monetize our intellectual property and accelerate market adoption curves associated with our technology 
most of our licenses include a field of use restriction that prevents the licensee from building a chip in direct competition with those market segments we have chosen to pursue 
revenue from development for licensees  licensing and royalties accounted for   and of our revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively 
licensing contracts are complex and depend upon many factors including completion of milestones  allocation of values to delivered items  and customer acceptances 
although we attempt to make these factors predictable  many of these factors require significant judgments 
in october  we raised approximately million in our initial public offering 
we have incurred losses in all but two quarterly periods since our inception and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
prior to we focused most of our efforts on the sale and development of panellink dvi transmitters  receivers and controllers for the pc and display market 
in  we began focusing our resources on entering two new markets  storage and ce  which we believed would grow significantly and in which we could apply our technology and expertise in high speed serial interfaces 
during  we acquired zillion  a developer of high speed transmission technology for data storage applications  and dvdo  a provider of digital video processing systems for the ce market 

table of contents in  we focused on accelerating our entry into the ce and storage markets  leveraging our ip into licensing revenue  and restructuring the company to improve profitability 
during  we acquired cmd  a provider of storage subsystems and semiconductors designed for storage area networks  and scl  a provider of mixed signal and high speed circuit designs 
during  we achieved double digit sequential revenue growth in each fiscal quarter  resulting in annual revenue of million  which was a increase from revenue levels 
we also began to see the benefits of our diversification strategy  which resulted in establishing a presence in the ce and storage markets 
additionally  we were able to successfully leverage our intellectual property to generate million of development  licensing and royalty revenue 
we also focused on improving our profitability and reducing our cash usage 
during  we achieved solid revenue growth  resulting in annual revenue of million  representing a increase compared to this growth was the result of our diversification strategy and the continued expansion of our presence in the ce and storage markets 
additionally  we were able to successfully leverage our intellectual property to generate million of development  licensing and royalty revenue 
year during  we achieved strong growth  resulting in annual revenue of million  representing a increase compared to we continued to take advantage of our diversification strategy and successfully expanded our presence in the ce and storage markets 
additionally  we were able to successfully leverage our intellectual property to generate million of development  licensing and royalty revenue 
in  we introduced our first hdmi products for the ce market 
hdmi is a new standard for digital video and audio transmission for consumer devices 
during  hdmi continued to gain momentum with nearly devices announced or shipping that incorporate hdmi  and we continue to be the hdmi market leader 
in the storage market  we had a number of new and advanced product offerings during we were able to achieve numerous design wins with our satalink products 
in particular  there was widespread market acceptance of the pci to four port sata solutions for the pc and server markets and a number of major manufacturers incorporated our products into their motherboards 
we believe we are well positioned to benefit from the continuing transition to sata technology 
furthermore we expect to leverage our storage expertise in the new and rapidly growing area for ce storage devices through our steelvine architecture 
we anticipate that many next generation consumer devices such as set top boxes  personal video recorders pvrs and media pcs are likely to have one or more external sata ports 
demand declined throughout for our parallel ata products as the market continued to transition from these technologies to serial ata 
we expect demand for these legacy products to continue to decrease significantly throughout and beyond 
in the pc market  during  our business was favorably impacted by the better than expected ramp in intel s grantsdale platform  a new intel integrated graphics chipset igc in desktop computers supporting intel s new pci express bus interface technology 
as pc manufacturers transitioned to pci express technology  they also transitioned to new dvi transmitters compatible with pci express igcs 
in addition  our business in the pc market was favorably impacted by strong demand for our integrated panel controllers that are incorporated into lcd panels used in digital lcd monitors 
when intel moved from pci to pci express on the grantsdale platform  it changed the interface for dvi transmitters and moved from the digital video output dvo interface to the new serial digital video output sdvo interface 
our dvi transmitter was designed to work with intel s sdvo port in the intel grantsdale platform  and sales of this transmitter will continue to be driven by the success of the grantsdale platform where dvi is offered 
dvi based solutions also found their way into ce applications during and revenue for these solutions is included in our ce revenues 
we expect the majority of these dvi ce applications to migrate to hdmi during the pc market saw dvi adoption expand significantly in to reach an estimated 
table of contents on pc hosts with on graphics cards 
we expect dvi adoption rates to continue to expand over the next two years as the market moves away from analog and dual mode combination of analog and digital solutions to all digital  higher quality and lower cost solutions 
correspondingly  we expect the prices of digital displays to continue to decrease and drive increased demand for digital only displays that incorporate dvi transmitters and panel controllers such as those sold by us 
we expect to introduce our next generation of panel controllers during generally  our transmitter products continued to experience competitive pressure  primarily from integration by the graphics chip suppliers such as ati technologies and nvidia 
thine electronics and texas instruments also remain competitors 
because of this increased competition there were lower average selling prices for these products during we expect graphics card manufacturers to continue to integrate a transmitter into their graphics chip  thus eliminating the need for a discrete transmitter device in many host products 
solutions that utilize the integrated graphics supplied by the intel chipset and that wish to connect to the lcd monitor via dvi will be the primary focus of our transmitter business 
in addition  we generated licensing revenue by licensing certain technology to companies for use in making products for the dual mode interface market 
in  we launched panellink cinema partners tm  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of silicon image  inc panellink cinema partners is chartered with the growth and proliferation of the panellink cinema partners initiative  and is currently supported by hitachi  lg  mitsubishi  sanyo  samsung  sony  sunplus  and others 
the panellink cinema partners program is aimed at providing consumers with a simple means to identify hdtv s and other consumer electronic devices as being content ready devices that is  the plc content ready logo identifies them as having been tested for hdcp functionality  and interoperability with other panellink branded consumer devices 
we believe that the consumer electronics industry is in the early stages of a transition to high definition all digital content 
our goal is to provide leadership in defining a secure content delivery infrastructure that will help power this transition 
during  we also focused on improving the company s profitability and improving our cash flows 
our cash and short term investments increased by million in  versus an increase of million in our net loss for the year ended december   was  compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  outlook the current semiconductor industry forecast  according to the sia semiconductor industry association january  report  is projecting overall semiconductor sales to decline for the first quarter and to be flat for the remainder of the year 
silicon image s growth profile for the year is more optimistic because it is driven by the adoption of emerging technologies that will fuel growth even if the associated market is not growing 
looking at the growth drivers for each of our product areas we see the following by product line 
first  our pc growth will be driven by dvi adoption rates which are expected to continue to increase and would help increase demand for silicon image dvi transmitters to work primarily with intel based graphics chipsets 
second  we anticipate growth in sales of digital only lcd monitors  which will provide opportunities for silicon image based panel controllers or dvi receivers 
and finally  we see some notebook computers incorporating dvi as a way to connect to an external monitor and even to drive the internal screen that is usually run by lvds 
our second product line is related to the ce market 
here we expect to leverage our leadership position in hdmi to enable us to capitalize on the consumer electronics industry s forecasted strong adoption of hdmi into additional devices during external forecasts such as that developed by in stat in their august report show unit growth for ce products utilizing either dvi or hdmi to have growth greater than in over silicon image will benefit from this high unit growth but will see its market share erode due to increased competition  declining average selling prices asps  and possible product mix shifts to lower priced solutions 

table of contents our third product area is storage 
our storage products are comprised of three groupings of products 
our legacy products parallel ata  and fibre channel are expected to decline sharply 
this decline should roughly be offset by growth in our sata product revenues 
the remaining storage area is our steelvine product offerings that we expect will have significant growth in the second half of the year 
our overall storage growth will likely be tied to the growth and success of our steelvine product line 
and finally  for the full year we expect our licensing revenues to be of total revenues 
looking at the first quarter of we see our overall revenues declining sequentially primarily because of seasonally weaker shipments in our ce business and the overall general softness of the semiconductor market as forecasted by the sia 
we expect our gross margin percentage to improve during the first quarter of  compared to the fourth quarter of  driven primarily by lower manufacturing costs 
we expect that our gross margin rates will decline over the remainder of the year due to increased competition that results in declining average selling prices faster than we can achieve offsetting cost improvements 
excluding non cash charges for stock compensation expense  we expect the dollar amount of our r d expense to increase approximately during the first quarter of relative to the fourth quarter of r d expense will be incurred for enhancements to existing products and for further development of technology related to personal computer  consumer electronics and storage applications 
additionally salary increases and seasonal benefit expenses will contribute to the projected increase in expense dollars 
excluding non cash charges for stock compensation expense  we expect the dollar amount of our sg a expense to increase approximately in the first quarter of  compared to the fourth quarter levels  primarily as a result of a combination of factors including  increased headcount  seasonal employee benefit expenses  salary increases  project expenses etc 
we cannot predict the actual r d or sg a expenses including the non cash charges for stock compensation expense  which will fluctuate with changes in our stock price and volatility 
in fact  we expect to incur potentially substantial non cash stock compensation expense in  and future periods as a result of previous stock option repricings  stock options assumed in connection with our prior acquisitions  the issuance of stock options to consultants  modifications to stock options and the impact of the adoption of sfas r share based payment 
we may also incur non cash stock compensation expense in connection with future acquisitions 
during and future periods  we may also incur non cash expenses for the impairment or amortization of intangible assets 
we will also incur legal fees in  in conjunction with our patent infringement lawsuit against genesis  and other outstanding or new litigation or investigations by regulatory agencies 
the amount of legal fees incurred will depend on the duration of the litigation  as well as the nature and extent of the litigation activities 
we are not able to accurately estimate the amount of legal fees we will incur with respect to this matter  however  we do expect to incur substantial amounts through at least the fourth quarter of we recorded a provision for income taxes amounting to  for the year ended december  primarily related to us alternative minimum taxes and foreign taxes 
no income tax provision was recorded for the years ended december  and  due to taxable losses 
our tax provisions in future periods will fluctuate over time and may increase if we achieve profitable operations 
the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by our assumptions include the rate at which the pc market adopts dvi  continued success of the grantsdale platform  acceptance of all digital solutions in the pc market  ce market acceptance of our dvi with hdcp and hdmi products  and the rate at which the storage market transitions to four port gb fibre channel switches and serial ata technology  market acceptance of our steelvine architecture and products  the overall consumer demand in the pc and ce markets  the availability of serial ata enabled hard drives and other peripherals  whether and how quickly competitors are able to integrate our technology or solutions into competing and alternative solutions  our ability to leverage our intellectual property into licensing revenue  and the ability of our semiconductor foundry vendors to manufacture our products in commercial volumes at an 
table of contents acceptable cost and in a timely manner 
in addition  our revenue remains subject to seasonality  competition and general economic and market conditions  none of which can be accurately predicted 
commitments  contingencies and concentrations historically  a relatively small number of customers and distributors have generated a significant portion of our revenue 
for instance  our top five customers  including distributors  generated   and of our revenue in   and  respectively 
the increase in from and levels can be attributed to the geographical concentration of our revenue as these customers are primarily in asia 
additionally  the percentage of revenue generated through distributors tends to be significant  since many oem s rely upon third party manufacturers or distributors to provide purchasing and inventory management functions 
in  of revenue was generated through distributors  compared to in and in our licensing revenue is not generated through distributors  and to the extent licensing revenue increases  we would expect a decrease in the percentage of our revenue generated through distributors 
a significant portion of our revenue is generated from products sold overseas 
sales including licensing to customers in asia  including distributors  generated   and of our revenue in   and  respectively 
the reason for our geographical concentration in asia is that most of our products are part of flat panel displays  graphic cards and motherboards  the majority of which are manufactured in asia 
the percentage of our revenue derived from any country is dependent upon where our end customers choose to manufacture their products 
accordingly  variability in our geographic revenue is not necessarily indicative of any geographic trends  but rather is the combined effect of new design wins and changes in customer manufacturing locations 
all revenue to date has been denominated in us dollars 
in september  we entered into an agreement with intel to develop and promote the adoption of a digital display interface specification 
in connection with this agreement  we granted intel a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share 
under the same agreement  we granted intel a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share upon achievement of a specified milestone that was reached during the first quarter of both of these warrants were exercised in may additionally  if a second specified milestone is achieved  which we do not believe is likely  we would be required to grant intel a third warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share 
the estimated fair value of the warrant at december   would be million 
this warrant would expire in september critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and all known facts and circumstances that we believe are relevant 
actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain revenue recognition for products sold directly to end users  or to distributors that do not receive price concessions and do not have rights of return 
accordingly  we recognize revenue upon shipment and title transfer if we believe collection is reasonably assured 
reserves for sales returns and allowances are estimated based primarily on historical experience and are provided at the time of shipment 
the amount of sales returns and allowances has not been  and is not expected to be  material 
the majority of our products are sold to distributors with agreements allowing for price concessions and product returns 
we recognize revenue based on our best estimate of when the distributor sold the product to its end customer based on point of sales reports received from our distributors 
due to the timing of receipt of these reports  we recognize distributor sell through using information that lags quarter end by one month 

table of contents revenue is not recognized upon shipment since  due to various forms of price concessions  the sales price is not substantially fixed or determinable at that time 
price concessions are recorded when incurred  which is generally at the time the distributor sells the product to an end user 
additionally  these distributors have contractual rights to return products  up to a specified amount for a given period of time 
revenue is earned when the distributor sells the product to an end user  at which time our sales price to the distributor becomes fixed 
our revenue is highly dependent on receiving pertinent and accurate data from our distributors in a timely fashion 
distributors provide us periodic data regarding the product  price  quantity  and end customer shipments as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock 
in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognize  we use this data and apply judgment in reconciling differences between their reported inventories and activities 
if distributors incorrectly report their inventories or activities  or if our judgment is in error  it could lead to inaccurate reporting of our revenues and income 
we have controls in place to minimize the likelihood of this occurrence  but there is no absolute assurance that this will not occur 
license revenue is recognized when an agreement with a licensee exists  the price is fixed or determinable  delivery or performance has occurred  and collection is reasonably assured 
generally  we expect to meet these criteria and recognize revenue at the time we deliver the agreed upon items 
however  we may defer recognition of revenue until cash is received if collection is not reasonably assured at the time of delivery 
a number of our license agreements require customer acceptance of deliverables  in which case we would defer recognition of revenue until the licensee has accepted the deliverables and either payment has been received or is expected within days of acceptance 
certain licensing agreements provide for royalty payments based on agreed upon royalty rates 
such rates can be fixed or variable depending on the terms of the agreement 
the amount of revenue we recognize is determined based on a time period or on the agreed upon royalty rate  extended by the number of units shipped by the customer 
to determine the number of units shipped  we rely upon actual royalty reports from our customers when available  and rely upon estimates in lieu of actual royalty reports when we have a sufficient history base of receiving royalties from a specific customer for us to make an estimate based on available information from the licensee such as quantities held  manufactured and other information 
these estimates for royalties necessarily involve the application of management judgment 
as a result of our use of estimates  period to period numbers are trued up in the following period to reflect actual units shipped 
to date  such true up adjustments have not been significant 
in cases where royalty reports and other information are not available to allow us to estimate royalty revenue  we recognize revenue only when royalty payments are received 
development revenue is recognized when project milestones have been completed and acknowledged by the other party to the development agreement  and collection is reasonably assured 
in certain instances  we recognize development revenue using the lesser of non refundable cash received or the results of using a proportional performance measure 
our license revenue recognition depends upon many factors including completion of milestones  allocation of values to delivered items and customer acceptances 
many of these factors require significant judgments  and if our judgment is in error it could lead to inaccurate reporting of our revenues and income 
allowance for doubtful accounts we review collectibility of accounts receivable on an on going basis and provide an allowance for amounts we estimate will not be collectible 
during our review  we consider our historical experience  the age of the receivable balance  the credit worthiness of the customer  and the reason for the delinquency 
write offs to date have not been material 
at december   we had million of gross accounts receivable and an allowance for doubtful accounts of  while we endeavor to accurately estimate the allowance  we may record unanticipated write offs in the future 
inventories we record inventories at the lower of actual cost  determined on a first in first out fifo basis  or market 
actual cost approximates standard cost and standard cost variances 
provisions are recorded for excess and obsolete inventory  and are estimated based on a comparison of the quantity and cost of inventory on hand to management s forecast of customer demand 
customer demand is dependent on many factors and requires us to use significant judgment in our forecasting process 
we must also make assumptions regarding the rate at 
table of contents which new products will be accepted in the marketplace and at which customers will transition from older products to newer products 
generally  inventories in excess of six months demand are written down to zero and the related provision is recorded as a cost of revenue 
while we endeavor to accurately predict demand and stock commensurate inventory levels  we may record unanticipated material inventory write downs in the future  which may negatively impact our operating results 
long lived assets consideration paid in connection with acquisitions is required to be allocated to the assets  including identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities acquired 
acquired assets and liabilities are recorded based on our estimate of fair value  which requires significant judgment with respect to future cash flows and discount rates 
for certain long lived assets  primarily fixed assets and intangible assets  we are required to estimate the useful life of the asset and recognize its cost as an expense over the useful life 
we use the straight line method to depreciate long lived assets 
we regularly compare the carrying value of long lived assets to our projection of future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets and in the event that the carrying value exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows  we record an impairment charge against income equal to the excess of the carrying value over the asset s fair value 
predicting future cash flows attributable to a particular asset is difficult  and requires the use of significant judgment 
if we were required to record an impairment charge in the future  it would negatively impact our operating results 
goodwill and intangible assets we adopted the statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets on january  this standard requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  and instead  be tested for impairment on a periodic basis 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of the business  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage our business  there is significant judgment in determining such future cash flows 
we also consider market capitalization adjusted for unallocated monetary assets such as cash  marketable debt securities and debt on the date we perform the analysis 
based on our annual impairment test performed for  we concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal however  there can be no assurance that we will not incur charges for impairment of goodwill in the future  which could adversely affect our earnings 
deferred tax assets we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements  but have not been reflected in our taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value 
therefore  we provide a valuation allowance to the extent we do not believe it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets 
to date  as a result of our recurring losses we have provided a valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets 
predicting future taxable income is difficult  and requires the use of significant judgment 
accrued liabilities certain of our accrued liabilities are based largely on estimates 
for instance  we record a liability on our consolidated balance sheet each period for the estimated cost of goods and services rendered to us  for which we have not received an invoice 
additionally  a component of our restructuring accrual related to a loss we expect to incur for excess leased facility space is based on numerous assumptions and estimates  such as the market value of the space and the time it will take to sublease the space 
our estimates are based on historical 
table of contents experience  input from sources outside the company  and other relevant facts and circumstances 
actual amounts could differ materially from these estimates 
certain of our licensing agreements indemnify our customers for expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of patent  trademark or copyright by third parties related to intellectual property content of our products 
certain of these indemnification provisions are perpetual from execution of the agreement and  in some instances  the maximum amount of potential future indemnification is not limited 
to date  we have not paid any such claims or been required to defend any lawsuits with respect to a claim 
stock based compensation expense we are required to determine the fair value of stock option grants to non employees  and to record the amount as an expense over the period during which services are provided to us 
management calculates the fair value of these stock option grants using the black scholes model  which requires us to estimate the life of the stock option  the volatility of our stock  an appropriate risk free interest rate  and our dividend yield 
we also fair value certain repriced options 
the calculation of fair value is highly sensitive to the expected life of the stock option and the volatility of our stock  both of which we estimate based primarily on historical experience 
legal matters we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims  either asserted or unasserted 
we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and reasonably estimate the amount of the loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of the probability and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated 
when we determine that it is probable that a loss has been incurred  the effect is recorded promptly in the consolidated financial statements 
although the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty  we do not believe that any of the existing legal matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
however  significant changes in legal proceedings and claims or the factors considered in the evaluation of those matters could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued additional guidance clarifying the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin r 
fin r provides a deferral of fin for certain entities until after march  fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity and further requires that an issuer classify as a liability or an asset in some circumstances financial instruments that fall within its scope because that financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer 
many of such instruments were previously classified as equity 
the statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of our operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter the statement clarified the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
the statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal as previously stated in paragraph of arb no 
 chapter in addition  the statement requires that allocation of fixed 
table of contents production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  on a prospective basis 
we believe that the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r revised  share based payment 
the statement is a revision of fasb and supersedes apb no 
the statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for good or services or incurs liabilities in exchange of goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments 
it focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
the statement requires an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award over the period during which an employee is required to provide service for the award 
the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments must be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments unless observable market prices for the same of similar instruments are available 
in addition  the statement requires a public entity measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of liability instruments based on its current fair value and that the fair value of that award will be remeasured subsequently at each reporting date through the settlement date 
the effective date of this statement for the company is for the first interim or annual period after june  while we have not determined the impact of this statement on our financial statements at this time  we believe it will be material 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  exchanges of nonmonetary assets 
the statement is an amendment of apb opinion no 
to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
we believe that the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our financial statements

a lower average stock price during  and a decline in the number of options subject to variable accounting  as certain older options become fully expensed  contributed to a decrease  which was offset by an increase in our repricing expense as a result of an increase in our stock price in the fourth quarter of we may continue to incur substantial non cash stock compensation expense in future periods as a result of the issuance of  or modifications to  restricted stock awards and stock option grants to employees and consultants  the stock option repricing programs we implemented in and  amortization of our existing unearned compensation balance  and d the impact of the adoption of sfas r 
since the expense associated with our stock option repricings and stock options issued to consultants is dependent on our stock price and volatility  stock compensation expense may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
to date we have recognized over million of expense in connection with our stock option repricings  and this may become an even more significant component of our stock compensation expense in future periods depending on our weighted average stock price and the number of such repriced options that continue to remain outstanding 
approximately million stock options were outstanding as of december  that were repriced in and for these re priced options  the company will continue to mark to market options that are vested and outstanding  until they are exercised  cancelled or are forfeited unexercised 
in future periods  to the extent that the market price of our stock exceeds or is lower than the market price as of

amortization of goodwill and intangible assets 
during  we recorded million of amortization of intangible assets  compared to million and million of expense for the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets  for and  respectively 
the amortization recorded during relates to intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of transwarp networks 
the increase in is due to a full years amortization during  compared to nine months during the decrease from to is attributable to the lower balance of amortizable intangibles during in process research and development 
in process research and development represents technology that has not reached technological feasibility and that has no alternative future use as of the acquisition date 
twn during the quarter ended june   we completed the acquisition of the assets of twn and recorded a one time expense of million for in process research and development 
as of the acquisition date  there was one identified development project that met the necessary criteria polaris 
the value of this project was determined by estimating the future cash flows from the time it was expected to be commercially feasible  discounting the net cash flows to present value  and applying a percentage of completion to the calculated values 
the net cash flows from the identified project were based on estimates of revenue  cost of revenue  research and development expenses  selling  general and administrative expenses and applicable income taxes 
revenue for polaris commenced in  and is expected to extend through we based our revenue projections on estimates of market size and growth  expected trends in technology and the expected timing of new product introductions by our competitors and us 
the discount rate used for this project was  which we believe is appropriate based on the risk associated with technology that is not yet commercially feasible 
the percentage of completion for this project was based on research and development expenses incurred immediately prior to the acquisition as a percentage of the total estimated research and development expenses required to bring this project to technological feasibility 
as of the date of the acquisition  we estimated that polaris was complete  with total projected costs of approximately  shipments of this product commenced during impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
in  we recorded million of expense for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisition of cmd in these assets became impaired as a result of our decision in the second quarter of  to transition to a licensing model for our storage subsystem board products  whereby instead of developing  manufacturing and selling board products  we decided to develop and license board designs in exchange for license fees and royalties 
there can be no assurance that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
based on our annual impairment test performed for  in accordance with sfas no 
 we concluded that there was no impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets in fiscal the impairment analysis was based on our estimates of forecasted discounted cash flows as well as our market capitalization at that time 
restructuring 
during the third quarter of  we began a program to focus our business on products and technology  including those obtained through acquisitions  in which we have  or believe we can achieve  a market leadership position 
as part of this program  we decided to cancel numerous products under development  to remove certain projects from our development plan  to phase out or de emphasize certain existing products and to integrate the operations of two acquired companies cmd and scl 
in connection with this program  we reduced our workforce in the fourth quarter of by approximately people  or 
in the first quarter of  we implemented a second workforce reduction in connection with the program discussed above  eliminating an additional positions  or of our workforce 
positions were eliminated from all functional areas 
this reduction resulted from the continued integration of acquired companies  as well as continued execution of our product and technology strategy  whereby we 
table of contents decided to phase out the legacy storage subsystem board products we acquired from cmd and to develop new board products only if we believed it would facilitate or accelerate the use of our storage semiconductor products 
in connection with this workforce reduction  we recorded a restructuring expense of million in the first quarter of  consisting of cash severance related costs of  non cash severance related costs of  representing the intrinsic value of modified stock options  an expected loss on leased facilities of million and fixed asset write downs of  for assets to be disposed of 
in addition  we reversed  of unearned compensation  a component of stockholders equity  for unvested stock options that were cancelled in connection with employee terminations 
in april  we decided to transition to a licensing model for our storage subsystem board products  whereby instead of developing  manufacturing and selling board products to facilitate or accelerate the use of our storage semiconductor products  we would develop and license board designs in exchange for license fees  royalties and the use of our semiconductor products 
in connection with this decision  we implemented a third workforce reduction  eliminating positions  or of our workforce  and recorded a restructuring expense of million  consisting of cash severance related costs of  non cash severance related costs of million representing the intrinsic value of modified stock options and fixed asset write downs of million for assets to be disposed of 
we also reversed  of unearned compensation  a component of stockholders equity  for unvested stock options that were cancelled in connection with employee terminations 
in connection with our decision to stop selling board products and to transition to a licensing model  we assessed recoverability of our intangible assets subject to amortization in accordance with sfas no 
during the quarter ended september   an impairment expense of  was recognized for acquired technology and  was recognized for patent and other intangible assets  based upon our projection of significantly reduced future cash flows 
additionally  we reduced our estimate of the useful lives of the remaining intangible assets subject to amortization such that these assets were fully amortized by the end of we also tested the carrying value of goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
as a result of our impairment test  a goodwill impairment expense of million was recognized during the second quarter of to determine the amount of the impairment  we estimated the fair value of our storage systems business based primarily on expected future cash flows 
we then reduced this amount by the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill also based primarily on expected future cash flows  and compared the unallocated fair value of the business to the carrying value of goodwill 
to the extent goodwill exceeded the unallocated fair value of the business  an impairment expense was recognized 
in december  we revised our estimate of the loss we expect to incur on subleased facilities and recorded a restructuring expense of million 
real estate market conditions deteriorated in the fourth quarter of  causing us to reassess the length of time it would take to find tenants and the fair value lease rate of our available space 
in march  we reorganized parts of the marketing and product engineering activities of the company into lines of business for pc  ce and storage products to enable us to better manage our long term growth potential 
the central engineering  sales  manufacturing  and general and administrative activities were not organized into the line of business structure 
in connection with this reorganization  we reduced our workforce by people  or approximately 
these reductions were primarily in engineering and operations functions 
because of this workforce reduction  we recorded restructuring expense of million in the first quarter of  consisting of cash severance related costs of  and non cash severance related costs of  representing the intrinsic value of modified stock options 
severance related costs were determined based on the amount of pay people received that was not for services performed and by measuring the intrinsic value of stock options that were modified to the benefit of terminated employees 
for those employees terminated in the three month period ending march   the remaining service period from the communication date did not exceed days 
the expected loss on leased facilities resulted from our plan to consolidate our remaining workforce to the extent practicable and sublease any excess space 
to determine the expected loss  we compared our lease and operating costs for the space to our estimate of the net amount we would be able to recover by subleasing the space 
this estimate was based on a number of assumptions  including the length of time it will take to secure a tenant  the sublease rate per square foot  the cost of necessary improvements or modifications and real estate broker commissions 
the 
table of contents fixed asset write downs in and were determined based on the estimated fair value of assets  primarily computer hardware and software that would no longer be utilized after the employees termination dates

patent assertion and acquisition integration costs were  million  and million for   and  respectively 
patent assertion costs are related to the lawsuit we filed against genesis in april  and acquisition integration costs represent costs incurred to integrate cmd and scl 
the decreases in and were due to lower levels of activity relating to the genesis litigation 
we expect to incur significant patent assertion costs through at least the fourth quarter of the amount of legal fees incurred in will depend on the duration of the litigation  as well as the nature and extent of the litigation activities 
we are not able to accurately estimate the amount of legal fees we will incur 
interest income 
interest income was   and  for   and  respectively 
the increase in interest income for is attributable primarily to the significantly increased cash and investment balances and the effect of investing a larger proportion of the portfolio in short term investments 
the declines in can be attributed primarily to lower interest rates 
interest expense and other net 
net interest expense and other was   and  for   and  respectively 
the change in can be attributed to lower interest expense due to lower debt balances offset by increased bank charges and other expenses 
the change in compared to can be attributed to decreasing average outstanding debt balances during and gain on derivative investment security 
during  we recorded a net gain of  from a derivative investment security 
this relates to common stock warrants acquired in connection with a transaction with leadis technology inc as described in note to the accompanying consolidated audited financial statements for the year ended december  
on september   we exercised the common stock warrants 
our equity investment in leadis has been and will continue to be included in our short term investments on our consolidated balance sheet  until our holding of the  shares are sold 
our typical practice is not to hold shares for investment purposes 
subsequent to year end  through february   we have sold approximately  shares 
provision for income taxes 
for the year ended december   we recorded a provision of  for income tax expense 
this amount includes approximately  relating to foreign withholding taxes payable in connection with our licensing contracts 
the remaining  of our income 
table of contents tax provision amount relates primarily to taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions where we have recently commenced operations and estimated provision for us alternative minimum taxes for the fiscal year ended december  due to our losses in and  no provision for income taxes was recorded in any of those years 
at december   we had a net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes of approximately million that expires in various years through these future tax benefits have not been recognized as an asset on our consolidated balance sheet due to sufficient uncertainties surrounding our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize these tax benefits 
a portion of these nols relate to prior acquisitions 
the tax reform act of  places limitations on how fast these acquisition related nols can be consumed 
as such  the amounts of  and benefits from  net operating loss carryforwards may or could be restricted or limited under certain circumstances 
we currently do not expect to be subject to these restrictions or limitations for gain on escrow settlement  net

accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased to million and million  respectively  at december  from million and million  respectively  at december  the increase in accounts payable was due to the timing of when payables became due  and the increase in accrued liabilities is primarily due to an accrual for employee bonus of million 
deferred margin on sales to distributors increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase is principally due to the effect of increased distributor related shipments at december  as compared to december  investing and financing activities we used million of cash in our investing activities in we used million towards the purchase of property and equipment and used million towards the net purchases of short term investments

this lease requires average monthly rental payments of approximately  and was secured by a certificate of deposit in the amount of  which was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
under the terms of the original lease agreement  this security requirement was not required after july  therefore we no longer maintain a certificate of deposit 
in december  we entered into a non cancelable operating lease renewal for our principal operating facility  including an additional  square feet of space in an adjacent building  that commenced in august and expires in july in june  the lease terms were amended and the company leased approximately  square feet of additional space for a total leased area of approximately  square feet

in june  in connection with our acquisition of cmd  we acquired the lease of an operating facility in irvine  california with average monthly rental payments of approximately  through november we have subleased parts of this facility to three separate third parties 
two of these sublease agreements are coterminous leases and extend through november  while the other sublease is on a month to month basis

based on our estimated cash flows for  we believe our existing cash and short term investments are sufficient to meet our capital and operating requirements for at least the next months 
our future operating and capital requirements depend on many factors  including the levels at which we generate product revenue and related margins  the timing and extent of development  licensing and royalty revenues  investments in inventory and accounts receivable  the cost of securing access to adequate manufacturing capacity  our operating expenses  including legal and patent assertion costs  and general economic conditions 
in addition  cash may be required for future acquisitions should we choose to pursue any 
to the extent existing resources 
table of contents and cash from operations are insufficient to support our activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
these funds may not be available  or if available  we may not be able to obtain them on terms favorable to us 
factors affecting future results you should carefully consider the following risk factors  together with all other information contained or incorporated by reference in this filing  before you decide to purchase shares of our common stock 
these factors could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by forward looking statements made by us 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
we operate in rapidly evolving markets  which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects 
the revenue and income potential of our business and the markets we serve are early in their lifecycle and are difficult to predict 
the digital visual interface dvi specification  which is based on technology developed by us and used in many of our products  was first published in april we completed our first generation of consumer electronics and storage ic products in mid to late in addition  the preliminary serial ata specification was first published in august and the high definition multimedia interface hdmi specification was first released in december accordingly  we face risks and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
if we do not successfully address these risks and difficulties  our results of operations could be negatively affected 
we have a history of losses and may not become profitable 
we have incurred net losses in each fiscal year since our inception  including net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we may continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we may not achieve and sustain profitability 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and are difficult to predict 
our quarterly operating results are likely to vary significantly in the future based on a number of factors over which we have little or no control 
these factors include  but are not limited to the growth  evolution and rate of adoption of industry standards for our key markets  including digital ready pcs and displays  consumer electronics and storage devices  the fact that our licensing revenue is heavily dependent on a few key licensing transactions being completed for any given period  the timing of which is not always predictable and is especially susceptible to delay beyond the period in which completion is expected  and our concentrated dependence on a few licensees in any period for substantial portions of our expected licensing revenue and profits  competitive pressures  such as the ability of competitors to successfully introduce products that are more cost effective or that offer greater functionality than our products  including integration into their products functionality offered by our products  and the prices set by competitors for their products  and the potential for alliances  combinations  mergers and acquisitions among our competitors  average selling prices of our products  which are influenced by competition and technological advancements  among other factors  government regulations regarding the timing and extent to which digital content must be made available to consumers  the availability of other semiconductors or other key components that are required to produce a complete solution for the customer  usually  we supply one of many necessary components  
table of contents the cost of components for our products and prices charged by the third parties who manufacture  assemble and test our products  fluctuations in the price of our common stock  which drive a substantial portion of our non cash stock compensation expense  and the nature and extent of litigation activities  particularly relating to our patent infringement suit against genesis microchip  and any subsequent legal proceedings related to the matters raised in that suit  and class action lawsuits against us that were initiated in early  because we have little or no control over these factors and or their magnitude  our operating results are difficult to predict 
any substantial adverse change in any of these factors could negatively affect our business and results of operations 
our future quarterly operating results are highly dependent upon how well we manage our business 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate based on how well we manage our business 
some of these factors include the following our ability to manage product introductions and transitions  develop necessary sales and marketing channels  and all other things necessary to enter new market segments  our ability to successfully manage our business in multiple markets such as pc  storage and ce  which may involve additional research and development  marketing or other costs and expenses  our ability to close licensing deals and make timely deliverables and milestones on which recognition of revenue often depends  our ability to engineer customer solutions that adhere to industry standards in a timely  and cost effective manner  our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and develop automated test programs within a reasonable time frame for our new products  our ability to manage joint ventures and projects  design services  and our supply chain partners  our ability to monitor the activities of our licensees to ensure compliance with license restrictions and remittance of royalties  our ability to structure our organization to enable achievement of our operating objectives and to meet the needs of our customers and markets  the success of the distribution and partner channels through which we choose to sell our products  and our ability to manage expenses and inventory levels 
if we fail to effectively manage our business  this could adversely affect our results of operations 
the licensing component of our business strategy increases business risk and volatility 
part of our business strategy is to license certain of our company s technology to companies that address markets in which we do not want to directly participate 
we have limited experience marketing and selling our technology on a licensing basis 
in conjunction with the business strategy we adopted in late  we signed our first license contract in december  and have signed others since then 
there can be no assurance that additional companies will be interested in licensing our technology on commercially favorable terms or at all 
we also cannot ensure that companies who license our technology will introduce and sell products incorporating our technology  will accurately report royalties owed to us  will pay agreed upon royalties  will honor agreed upon market restrictions  will not infringe upon or misappropriate our intellectual property and will maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information 
licensing contracts are complex and depend upon many factors including completion of milestones  allocation of values to delivered items  and customer acceptances 
many of these factors require significant judgments 
licensing revenues could fluctuate 
table of contents significantly from period to period because it is heavily dependent on a few key deals being completed in a particular period  the timing of which is difficult to predict 
because of their high margin content  licensing revenues can have a disproportionate impact on gross margins and profitability 
also  generating revenue from licensing arrangements is a lengthy and complex process that may last beyond the period in which efforts begin  and once an agreement is in place  the timing of revenue recognition may be dependent on customer acceptance of deliverables  achievement of milestones  our ability to track and report progress on contracts  customer commercialization of the licensed technology  and other factors 
in addition  in any period  our expectation of licensing revenue is or may be dependent on one or a few licenses being completed 
licensing that occurs in the course of actual or contemplated litigation is subject to risk that the adversarial nature of the transaction will induce non compliance or non payment 
the accounting rules associated with recognizing revenue from licensing transactions are increasingly complex and subject to interpretation 
due to these factors  the amount of license revenue recognized in any period may differ significantly from our expectations 
we face intense competition in our markets  which may lead to reduce revenue from sales of our products and increased losses 
the pc  ce and storage markets in which we operate are intensely competitive 
these markets are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving standards  short product life cycles and declining selling prices 
our display products face competition from a number of sources  including analog solutions  dvi based solutions  dual analog and dvi based solutions and other digital interface solutions 
we expect competition in the display market to increase 
for example  analog devices  ati  broadcom  chrontel  genesis microchip  explore tech  national semiconductor  novatek  nvidia  philips  pixelworks  sis  smart asic  st microelectronics  sunplus  texas instruments  thine  and weltrend  are shipping products or have announced intentions to introduce products and or other digital interface solutions that we expect will compete with our panellink products 
other companies have announced dvi based solutions and we expect that additional companies are likely to enter the market 
current or potential customers  including our own licensees  may also develop solutions that could compete with us  directly or indirectly  such as the integration of a dvi transmitter into a graphics processing chip or integration of a dvi receiver into a panel monitor controller 
in the ce market  our digital interface products are used to connect cable set top boxes  satellite set top boxes and dvd players to digital televisions 
these products incorporate dvi and high bandwidth digital content protection hdcp  or hdmi with or without hdcp support 
companies that have announced or are shipping dvi hdcp solutions include texas instruments ti  toshiba  panasonic  mstar  thine  broadcom and genesis microchip genesis 
in addition  our video processing products face competition from products sold by av science  broadcom  focus enhancements  genesis  mediamatics  micronas semiconductor  oplus  philips  pixelworks  zoran  ati and trident 
we also compete  in some instances  against in house developed solutions designed by large original equipment manufacturers and or customers with captive in house semiconductor capabilities 
we expect competition for hdmi products from the other hdmi founders and adopters  including hitachi  matsushita  philips  sony  thomson  toshiba  mstar  and analog devices 
toshiba and matsushita have working hdmi solutions 
silicon image has worked to develop a unique strategy that involves both the creation of partnerships as well as the licensing of our intellectual property to accelerate the adoption of new standards such as serial ata and hdmi 
this strategy allows silicon image to be recognized as the de facto inter operability leader in the industry 
as an example  silicon image has entered into a strategic licensing deal with mediatek a major supplier of dvd player chipsets 
silicon image recognized that the dvd player market is fiercely competitive and the emerging hdmi technology would likely be integrated into existing system on a chip solutions 
based on this recognition  silicon image proactively licensed our hdmi transmitter technology to mediatek for incorporation in their chipsets that we hope will begin shipping during this arrangement involved fees paid to silicon image upon delivery of the solution and possible payments per unit dependent upon the volume of units shipped by mediatek 
this deal was strategic to silicon image in that silicon image agreed to give mediatek a reduction on payments if mediatek achieved certain aggressive milestones units shipped during silicon image was willing to agree to this provision with the belief that this was not a 
table of contents sustainable market for our discrete solutions  and to the extent more source devices were enabled with hdmi  we felt this would create additional opportunities for silicon image s hdmi receiver products 
this arrangement makes mediatek a competitor in the sense they will win a portion of the market but also makes them a partner in helping fuel sales on the receiver side 
another example is our strategic relationship with sunplus 
silicon image has licensing arrangements as well as agreements involving joint product development and the manufacture and supply of products 
these agreements make sunplus a strategic partner in that silicon image has access to technology and manufacturing facilities not previously available and also garners an ongoing royalty when sunplus makes a chip sale that integrates hdmi or sata 
silicon image has several other licensees and smaller partnerships of a similar nature 
the effect of these partnerships over time should accelerate growth and lower research and development expenses 
while the products developed in these partnerships may return lower gross margins for silicon image  they will fuel higher revenues with less investment in development expenses  thus these products are expected to contribute to the bottom line in a similar fashion to the contribution we receive from higher gross margin  non partnership related products 
in the storage market  our fibre channel products face competition from companies selling similar discrete products  including pmc sierra  serverworks and vitesse  from other fibre channel serializer deserializer serdes providers who license their core technology  such as lsi logic  and from companies that sell host bus adapters hba controllers with integrated serdes  such as qlogic and agilent 
in the future  our current or potential customers may also develop their own proprietary solutions that may include integration of serdes 
our sata products compete with similar products from marvell and promise 
in addition  other companies such as adaptec  apt  ati  intel  lsi logic  serverworks and vitesse have developed or announced intentions to develop sata controllers 
we also compete against intel and other motherboard chipset makers that have integrated sata functionality into their chipsets 
our parallel ata products compete with similar products from promise and highpoint 
our steelvine products compete with similar products from adaptec  iqstor and xyratex 
some of these competitors have already established supplier or joint development relationships with current or potential customers and may be able to leverage their existing relationships to discourage these customers from purchasing products from us or persuade them to replace our products with theirs 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater presence in key markets  better name recognition  access to larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing  distribution  technical and other resources than we do 
in addition  some of our competitors could merge for example  genesis and pixelworks announced  and then terminated  such a merger  which may enhance their market presence 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and customer requirements  or devote more resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
we cannot assure you that we can compete successfully against current or potential competitors  or that competition will not reduce our revenue and increase our losses 
demand for our consumer electronics products is dependent on the adoption and widespread use of the hdmi specification 
our success in the consumer electronics market is largely dependent upon the rapid and widespread adoption of the hdmi specification  which combines high definition video and multi channel audio in one digital interface and uses our patented underlying transition minimized differential signaling tmds technology  and optionally intel s hdcp technology  as the basis for the interface 
version of the specification was published for adoption in december and version of the specification was published for adoption in may we cannot predict the rate at which manufacturers will adopt the hdmi specification 
adoption of the hdmi specification may be affected by the availability of consumer products  such as dvd players and televisions  and of computer components that implement this new interface 
other 
table of contents competing specifications may also emerge that could adversely affect the acceptance of the hdmi specification 
delays in the widespread adoption of the hdmi specification could reduce acceptance of our products  limit or reduce our revenue growth and increase our losses 
we believe that the adoption of our ce products may be affected in part by us and international regulations relating to digital television  cable  satellite and over the air digital transmissions  specifically regulations relating to the transition from analog to digital television 
the federal communications commission fcc has adopted rules governing the transition from analog to digital television  which include rules governing the requirements for television sets sold in the united states designed to speed the transition to digital television 
the fcc has delayed such requirements and timetables for phasing in digital television in the past 
we cannot predict whether the fcc will further delay its rules relating to the digital television requirements and timetables 
in the event that additional regulatory activities  either in the united states or internationally  delay or postpone the transition to digital television beyond the anticipated time frame  that could reduce the demand for our ce products 
in addition  we believe that the rate of hdmi adoption may be accelerated by fcc rules requiring that after july high definition stbs distributed by cable operators include a dvi or hdmi interface and that as of certain phase in dates televisions marketed or labeled as digital cable ready include a dvi or hdmi interface 
however  we cannot predict whether these rules will be amended prior to phase in or that their phase in dates will not be pushed back or otherwise delayed 
in the event that the phase in dates are postponed or otherwise delayed the demand for our products could be reduced  which would adversely affect our business 
in the event that mandatory use of a dvi or hdmi interface in stbs distributed by cable operators were to be delayed beyond the currently anticipated time frame or not required at all  that could reduce the demand for our ce products  which would adversely affect our business 
in addition  we cannot guarantee that the fcc will not in the future reverse these rules or adopt rules requiring or supporting different interface technologies  either of which would adversely affect our business 
we believe that the adoption of hdmi may be affected by the availability of high quality digital content to devices equipped with hdmi or dvi interfaces 
typically high quality digital content is made available to devices equipped with hdmi or dvi interfaces through high definition television or digital television distribution channels 
to the extent that the availability of such content is delayed or not made available by the content owners or broadcasters and distributors of such content then demand for hdmi products could be delayed or reduced 
transmissions of audio and video from source to sink devices over hdmi with hdcp represents a combination of new technologies working in concert 
cable and satellite system operators are just beginning to require transmissions of digital video with hdcp between source and sink devices in consumer homes  and dvd players incorporating this technology have only recently come to market 
complexities with these technologies and the variability in implementations between manufacturers may cause some of these products to work incorrectly  or for the transmissions to not occur correctly  or for certain products not to be interoperable 
also  the user experience associated with audiovisual transmissions over hdmi with hdcp is unproven  and users may reject products incorporating these technologies or they may require more customer support than expected 
delays or difficulties in integration of these technologies into products or failure of products incorporating this technology to achieve market acceptance could have an adverse effect on our business 
growth of the market for our pc products depends on the widespread adoption and use of the dvi specification 
our success is largely dependent upon the rapid and widespread adoption of the dvi specification  which defines a high speed data communication link between computers and digital displays 
we cannot predict the rate at which manufacturers of computers and digital displays will adopt the dvi specification 
the adoption of dvi has been slower than we originally anticipated 
the dvi adoption rate in the pc market was reported to be approximately and in and  respectively 
reportedly  the dvi adoption rate in the pc market is approximately in the range of 
adoption of the dvi specification may be affected by 
table of contents the availability of computer components able to communicate dvi compliant signals  such as transmitters  receivers  connectors and cables necessary to implement the specification 
other specifications may also emerge that could adversely affect the acceptance of the dvi specification 
for example  a number of companies have promoted alternatives to the dvi specification using other interface technologies  such as low voltage differential signaling  or lvds 
further delays in the widespread adoption of the dvi specification could reduce acceptance of our products  limit or reduce our revenue growth and increase our losses 
our success depends on the growth of the digital display market 
our pc business depends on the growth of the digital display market 
the potential size of the digital display market and its rate of development are uncertain and will depend on many factors  including the number of digital ready computers that are being produced and consumer demand for these computers  the rate at which display manufacturers replace analog or non compliant dvi interfaces with fully dvi compliant interfaces  the availability of cost effective semiconductors that implement a fully dvi compliant interface  and improvements to analog technology  which may decrease consumer demand for our digital display products 
in order for the digital display market to grow  digital displays must be widely available and affordable to consumers 
in the past  the supply of digital displays  such as flat panels  has been cyclical and consumers have been very price sensitive 
also  some manufacturers have implemented dvi interfaces that are not fully dvi compliant 
these interfaces often interfere with the operability of our products which function best with a fully dvi compliant interface 
our ability to sustain or increase our revenue may be limited should there not be an adequate supply of  or demand for  affordable digital displays with dvi compliant interfaces 
a significant amount of our revenue is associated with the adoption of new or emerging technologies within the pc industry 
the pc industry has slowed and the adoption of these new technologies may not occur as planned 
a large portion of our revenue is directly or indirectly related to the pc industry and the adoption of new or emerging technologies within the pc industry 
accordingly  we are highly dependent on the adoption of new or emerging technologies within the pc industry  which experienced a slowdown in growth during the second half of that has continued into we cannot predict the duration or severity of the downturn in the pc and display market  or in the general economy  or its effect on our revenue and operating results  including the adoption of these new or emerging technologies 
if the market for pcs and pc related displays continues to grow at a slow rate or contracts whether due to reduced demand from end users  macroeconomic conditions or other factors  our business and results of operations could be negatively affected 
although we have broadened our product offerings to include more products in the consumer electronics and storage markets  there can be no guarantee that we will achieve long term success in these markets 
to date  we have achieved reasonable success  but if we fail to consistently achieve design wins in the consumer electronics and storage markets  we would become more dependent on our pc related products for the pc industry 
in general  the demand for our products in the pc market is highly dependent upon intel s continued integration of sdvo and pci express into its pc chipset platforms 
although intel has included sdvo and pci express in its grantsdale platform  there is no assurance that intel will continue to include dvi support in its future platforms 
our revenue generated from sales of dvi transmitters and sata host controllers is highly dependent upon the ability of such transmitters to work with existing intel pc chipset platforms 
if intel fails to integrate sdvo and pci express or some other convenient method to interface to our products in its future pc chipset platforms  then the demand for our dvi transmitters could be adversely affected 
demand for our dvi receiver products is also highly dependent upon intel s integration of serial interfaces 
table of contents into its pc chipset platform because of intel s dominant market share in the pc business 
if intel were to discontinue support for serial interfaces  then the number of available pcs with a dvi port could significantly decrease  thus reducing demand for our dvi receivers 
our success depends in part on new strategic relationships 
we have recently entered into several strategic partnerships and joint ventures with third parties 
examples include our licensing arrangements with mediatek  under which we licensed our hdmi transmitter technology to mediatek for incorporation into their dvd player chipsets  and our licensing and joint venture arrangements with sunplus  under which sunplus licenses our technology and we and sunplus jointly develop products for manufacture and supply by a joint venture entity 
we have several other smaller licenses and partnerships of a similar nature 
while these arrangements are designed to drive revenue growth and adoption of our technologies and industry standards promulgated by us and also reduce our research and development expenses  there is no guarantee that these arrangements will be successful 
negotiating and performing under these arrangements involves significant time and expense  we may not realize anticipated increases in revenues  standards adoption or cost savings  and these arrangements may make it easier for the third parties to compete with us  any of which may have a negative affect our business and results of operations 
our success depends on the development and growth of markets for products based on new and emerging storage technologies 
our product development efforts in the storage market are focused on the development of products using new interface technologies such as fibre channel and sata 
the markets for these new interface technologies are at an early stage of development  and there can be no assurance that they will replace other storage interfaces that are now widely used  such as parallel ata and scsi 
the potential size and rate of development of these markets are uncertain and will depend on many factors  including the rate at which manufacturers of storage subsystems adopt new interface technologies  which may be more costly to implement than existing interface technologies until volumes are sufficient to bring costs to competitive levels  the availability of cost effective semiconductors and components for storage subsystems  such as sata enabled hard drives and sata enabled optical drives cd and dvd that implement new interface technologies for the storage market  whether and to the degree intel or other motherboard manufacturers integrate the functionality of our products  such as sata  into their chips and chipsets  and improvement to existing storage interface technologies such as parallel ata and scsi  or the introduction of other new storage interface technologies  either of which may decrease consumer demand for our storage products 
in particular  the rate of implementation of the sata interface will depend on how quickly drive optical and hard disk manufacturers  motherboard and pc providers and chipmakers are able to resolve technical communication and functionality issues to enable a plug and play environment in which a computer system is automatically able to recognize and configure storage devices 
resolution of these issues could be time consuming  and will depend in good measure on the ability of chipmakers to incorporate the required high speed serial data transfer capabilities into their semiconductors without sacrificing manufacturing yields 
any delay in acceptance of new interface technologies  or a reduction in the growth or size of the market for systems based on sata or fibre channel technologies  would limit sales of our storage products and reduce our revenue 
any delay in the availability of serial ata compatible drives or acceleration of serial ata or fibre channel serdes integration efforts by motherboard or storage controller manufacturers may also reduce our revenue 

table of contents we have promulgated a satalite specification to which we have invited key industry members to participate 
this program includes certain licenses to our technology that we hope will increase market acceptance of our serial ata products 
there can be no assurance that this program will succeed  or that satalite participants will not use our technology to compete against us 
to date  we have achieved a number of design wins for our serial ata and fibre channel storage products 
even after we have achieved a design win from an original equipment manufacturer oem  we may not realize any revenue  or significant revenue  from that oem since a design win is not a binding commitment to purchase our products and the oem may not achieve market acceptance for their product 
further delay in serial ata enabled drive availability may lead oems to re open their designs and designs we have won may be subject to being lost  which could reduce our revenue and increase our operating expenses in competing to re win designs 
with respect to our product offerings based upon the steelvine architecture  there can be no assurance such product offerings will achieve the desired level of market acceptance in the anticipated timeframes or that such product offerings will be successful 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will be able to introduce these products into the marketplace on a timely basis or that we will be successful in achieving the necessary partners and channels to be successful in the marketplace 
our inability to be timely in product introductions and or have adequate partners and channels may adversely impact our ability to be successful with this line of products and would adversely affect our business 
it is anticipated that the products based upon the steelvine architecture will be sold into markets where we have limited experience 
furthermore  there is no established market for these products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully market and sell the products based upon the steelvine architecture and failure to do so would adversely affect our business 
we do not have long term commitments from our customers and we allocate resources based on our estimates of customer demand 
substantially all of our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders  rather than long term agreements 
in addition  our customers may cancel or reschedule purchase orders 
we purchase inventory components and build our products according to our estimates of customer demand 
this process requires us to make multiple assumptions  including volume and timing of customer demand for each product  manufacturing yields and product quality 
if we overestimate customer demand or product quality or under estimate manufacturing yields  we may build products that we may not be able to sell at an acceptable price or at all 
as a result  we would have excess inventory  which would increase our losses 
additionally  if we underestimate customer demand or if sufficient manufacturing capacity is unavailable  we will forego revenue opportunities or incur significant costs for rapid increases in production  lose market share and damage our customer relationships 
our lengthy sales cycle can result in a delay between incurring expenses and generating revenue  which could harm our operating results 
because our products are based on new technology and standards  a lengthy sales process  typically requiring several months or more  is often required before potential customers begin the technical evaluation of our products 
this technical evaluation can exceed nine months before the potential customer informs us whether we have achieved a design win  which is not a binding commitment to purchase our products 
after achieving a design win  it can then be an additional nine months before a customer commences volume shipments of systems incorporating our products  if at all 
given our lengthy sales cycle  we may experience a delay between the time we incur expenditures and the time we generate revenue  if any 
as a result  our operating results could be seriously harmed if a significant customer reduces or delays orders  or chooses not to release products incorporating our products 
we depend on a few key customers and the loss of any of them could significantly reduce our revenue 
historically  a relatively small number of customers and distributors have generated a significant portion of our revenue 
for the year ended december   shipments to world peace international  an asian 
table of contents distributor  generated of our revenue and shipments to microtek  a distributor  generated of our revenue 
for the year ended december   shipments to world peace international  generated of our revenue  and shipments to weikeng  a distributor  generated of our revenue 
in addition  an end customer may buy through multiple distributors  contract manufacturers  and or directly  which could create an even greater concentration 
we cannot be certain that customers and key distributors that have accounted for significant revenue in past periods  individually or as a group  will continue to sell our products and generate revenue 
as a result of this concentration of our customers  our results of operations could be negatively affected if any of the following occurs one or more of our customers  including distributors  becomes insolvent or goes out of business  one or more of our key customers or distributors significantly reduces  delays or cancels orders  or one or more significant customers selects products manufactured by one of our competitors for inclusion in their future product generations 
due to our participation in multiple markets  our customer base has broadened significantly and we therefore anticipate being less dependent on a relatively small number of customers to generate revenue 
however  as product mix fluctuates from quarter to quarter  we may become more dependent on a small number of customers or a single customer for a significant portion of our revenue in a particular quarter  the loss of which could adversely affect our operating results 
we sell our products through distributors  which limits our direct interaction with our customers  therefore reducing our ability to forecast sales and increasing the complexity of our business 
many original equipment manufacturers rely on third party manufacturers or distributors to provide inventory management and purchasing functions 
distributors generated of our revenue for the year ended december   of our revenue for the year ended december   and of our revenue for the year ended december  selling through distributors reduces our ability to forecast sales and increases the complexity of our business  requiring us to manage a more complex supply chain  monitor and manage the level of inventory of our products at each distributor  estimate the impact of credits  return rights  price protection and unsold inventory at distributors  and monitor the financial condition and credit worthiness of our distributors  many of which are located outside of the united states  and the majority of which are not publicly traded  since we have limited ability to forecast inventory levels at our end customers  it is possible that there may be significant build up of inventories in the retail channel  with the oem or the oem s contract manufacturer 
such a buildup could result in a slowdown in orders  requests for returns from customers  or requests to move out planned shipments 
this could adversely impact our revenues and profits 
any failure to manage these challenges could disrupt or reduce sales of our products and unfavorably impact our financial results 
our success depends on the development and introduction of new products  which we may not be able to do in a timely manner because the process of developing high speed semiconductor products is complex and costly 
the development of new products is highly complex  and we have experienced delays  some of which exceeded one year  in the development and introduction of new products on several occasions in the past 
we have recently introduced new storage products for the consumer electronics and small and medium business markets and we expect to introduce new consumer electronics  storage and pc products in the future 
as our products integrate new  more advanced functions  they become more complex and increasingly difficult to 
table of contents design  manufacture and debug 
successful product development and introduction depends on a number of factors  including  but not limited to accurate prediction of market requirements and evolving standards  including enhancements or modifications to existing standards such as dvi  hdcp  sata i and sata ii  and hdmi  identification of customer needs where we can apply our innovation and skills to create new standards or areas for product differentiation that improve our overall competitiveness either in an existing market or in a new market  development of advanced technologies and capabilities  and new products that satisfy customer requirements  competitors and customers integration of the functionality of our products into their products  which puts pressure on us to continue to develop and introduce new products with new functionality  timely completion and introduction of new product designs  management of product life cycles  use of leading edge foundry processes and achievement of high manufacturing yields and low cost testing  and market acceptance of new products 
accomplishing all of this is extremely challenging  time consuming and expensive and there is no assurance that we will succeed 
product development delays may result from unanticipated engineering complexities  changing market or competitive product requirements or specifications  difficulties in overcoming resource limitations  the inability to license third party technology or other factors 
competitors and customers may integrate the functionality of our products into their products that would reduce demand for our products 
if we are not able to develop and introduce our products successfully and in a timely manner  our costs could increase or our revenue could decrease  both of which would adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  it is possible that we may experience delays in generating revenue from these products or that we may never generate revenue from these products 
we must work with a semiconductor foundry and with potential customers to complete new product development and to validate manufacturing methods and processes to support volume production and potential re work 
each of these steps may involve unanticipated difficulties  which could delay product introduction and reduce market acceptance of the product 
in addition  these difficulties and the increasing complexity of our products may result in the introduction of products that contain defects or that do not perform as expected  which would harm our relationships with customers and our ability to achieve market acceptance of our new products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve design wins for our planned new products  that we will be able to complete development of these products when anticipated  or that these products can be manufactured in commercial volumes at acceptable yields  or that any design wins will produce any revenue 
failure to develop and introduce new products  successfully and in a timely manner  may adversely affect our results of operations 
we have made acquisitions in the past and may make acquisitions in the future  if advisable  and these acquisitions involve numerous risks 
our growth depends upon market growth and our ability to enhance our existing products and introduce new products on a timely basis 
one of the ways we develop new products and enter new markets is through acquisitions 
in  we completed the acquisitions of cmd and scl 
in april  we acquired twn 
we may acquire additional companies or technologies 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including  but not limited to  the following difficulty and increased costs in assimilating employees  including our possible inability to keep and retain key employees of the acquired business  disruption of our ongoing business  
table of contents discovery of undisclosed liabilities of the acquired companies and legal disputes with founders or shareholders of acquired companies  inability to successfully incorporate acquired technology and operations into our business and maintain uniform standards  controls  policies and procedures  inability to commercialize acquired technology  and the need to take impairment charges or write downs with respect to acquired assets 
no assurance can be given that our prior acquisitions or our future acquisitions  if any  will be successful or provide the anticipated benefits  or that they will not adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
failure to manage growth effectively and to successfully integrate acquisitions made by us could materially harm our business and operating results 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry may create constrictions in our foundry  test and assembly capacity 
in the past  the semiconductor industry has been characterized by significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand 
for example  demand in the semiconductor industry rose to record levels in  and then declined until beginning to show signs of recovery during and the industry has also experienced significant fluctuations in anticipation of changes in general economic conditions 
this cyclicality has led to significant fluctuations in product demand and in the foundry  test and assembly capacity of third party suppliers 
production capacity for fabricated semiconductors is subject to allocation  whereby not all of our production requirements would be met 
this may impact our ability to meet demand and could also increase our production costs 
cyclicality has also accelerated decreases in average selling prices per unit 
we may experience fluctuations in our future financial results because of changes in industry wide conditions 
we depend on third party sub contractors to manufacture  assemble and test nearly all of our products  which reduce our control over the production process 
we do not own or operate a semiconductor fabrication facility 
we rely on taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc  an outside foundry  to produce the vast majority all of our semiconductor products 
we also rely on kawasaki  umc and atmel  for outside foundry services  and on amkor and ase to test certain of our semiconductor products 
our reliance on independent foundries  assembly and test facilities involves a number of significant risks  including  but not limited to reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance  manufacturing yields and production costs  lack of guaranteed production capacity or product supply  lack of availability of  or delayed access to  next generation or key process technologies  and our ability to transition to alternate sources if services are unavailable from primary suppliers 
in addition  our semiconductor products are assembled and tested by several independent subcontractors 
we do not have a long term supply agreement with our subcontractors  and instead obtain production services on a purchase order basis 
our outside sub contractors have no obligation to supply products to us for any specific period of time  in any specific quantity or at any specific price  except as set forth in a particular purchase order 
our requirements represent a small portion of the total production capacity of our outside foundries  assembly and test facilities and our sub contractors may reallocate capacity to other customers even during periods of high demand for our products 
these foundries may allocate or move production of our products to different foundries under their control  even in different locations  which may be time consuming  costly  and difficult  have an adverse affect on quality  yields  and costs  and require us and or our customers to re qualify the products  which could open up design wins to competition and result in the loss of design wins and design ins 
if our subcontractors are unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing our products in the required volumes  at acceptable quality  yields and costs  and in a timely manner  our business will be substantially harmed 
as a result  we would have to identify and qualify substitute contractors  which would be 
table of contents time consuming  costly and difficult 
this qualification process may also require significant effort by our customers  and may lead to re qualification of parts  opening up design wins to competition  and loss of design wins and design ins 
any of these circumstances could substantially harm our business 
in addition  if competition for foundry  assembly and test capacity increases  our product costs may increase and we may be required to pay significant amounts or make significant purchase commitments to secure access to production services 
the complex nature of our production process  which can reduce yields and prevent identification of problems until well into the production cycle or  in some cases  after the product has been shipped 
the manufacture of semiconductors is a complex process  and it is often difficult for semiconductor foundries to achieve acceptable product yields 
product yields depend on both our product design and the manufacturing process technology unique to the semiconductor foundry 
since low yields may result from either design or process difficulties  identifying problems can often only occur well into the production cycle  when an actual product exists that can be analyzed and tested 
further  we only test our products after they are assembled  as their high speed nature makes earlier testing difficult and expensive 
as a result  defects often are not discovered until after assembly 
this could result in a substantial number of defective products being assembled and tested or shipped  thus lowering our yields and increasing our costs 
these risks could result in product shortages or increased costs of assembling  testing or even replacing our products 
although we test our products before shipment  they are complex and may contain defects and errors 
in the past we have encountered defects and errors in our products 
because our products are sometimes integrated with products from other vendors  it can be difficult to identify the source of any particular problem 
delivery of products with defects or reliability  quality or compatibility problems  may damage our reputation and our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers 
in addition  product defects and errors could result in additional development costs  diversion of technical resources  delayed product shipments  increased product returns  warranty and product liability claims against us that may not be fully covered by insurance 
any of these circumstances could substantially harm our business 
we face foreign business  political and economic risks because a majority of our products and our customers products are manufactured and sold outside of the united states 
a substantial portion of our business is conducted outside of the united states 
as a result  we are subject to foreign business  political and economic risks 
nearly all of our products are manufactured in taiwan or elsewhere in asia  and for the years ended december   and   and of our revenue respectively was generated from customers and distributors located outside of the united states  primarily in asia 
we anticipate that sales outside of the united states will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenue in future periods 
accordingly  we are subject to international risks  including  but not limited to difficulties in managing from afar  political and economic instability  including international tension in iraq  korea and the china strait and lack of normal diplomatic relationships between the united states and taiwan  less developed infrastructures in newly industrializing countries  susceptibility of foreign areas to terrorist attacks  susceptibility to interruptions of travel  including those due to international tensions including the war in and occupation of iraq  medical issues such as the sars and avian flu epidemics particularly affecting the asian markets we serve  and the financial instability and bankruptcy of major air carriers  bias against foreign  especially american  companies  
table of contents difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  expense and difficulties in protecting our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions  difficulties in complying with multiple  conflicting and changing laws and regulations  including export requirements  tariffs  import duties  visa restrictions  environmental laws and other barriers  exposure to possible litigation or claims in foreign jurisdictions  and competition from foreign based suppliers and the existence of protectionist laws and business practices that favor these suppliers  such as withholding taxes on payments made to us 
these risks could adversely affect our business and our results of operations 
in addition  original equipment manufacturers that design our semiconductors into their products sell them outside of the united states 
this exposes us indirectly to foreign risks 
because sales of our products are denominated exclusively in united states dollars  relative increases in the value of the united states dollar will increase the foreign currency price equivalent of our products  which could lead to a change in the competitive nature of these products in the marketplace 
this in turn could lead to a reduction in sales and profits 
the success of our business depends upon our ability to adequately protect our intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark  mask work and trade secret laws  as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods  to protect our proprietary technologies 
we have been issued patents and have a number of pending patent applications 
however  we cannot assure you that any patents will be issued as a result of any applications or  if issued  that any claims allowed will protect our technology 
in addition  we do not file patent applications on a worldwide basis  meaning we do not have patent protection in some jurisdictions 
it may be possible for a third party  including our licensees  to misappropriate our copyrighted material or trademarks 
it is possible that existing or future patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented and effective patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries 
it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization  develop similar technology independently or design around our patents in the united states and in other jurisdictions 
it is also possible that some of our existing or new licensing relationships will enable other parties to use our intellectual property to compete against us 
legal actions to enforce intellectual property rights tend to be lengthy and expensive  and the outcome often is not predictable 
as a result  despite our efforts and expenses  we may be unable to prevent others from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property  which could harm our business 
in addition  practicality also limits our assertion of intellectual property rights 
patent litigation is expensive and its results are often unpredictable 
assertion of intellectual property rights often results in counterclaims for perceived violations of the defendant s intellectual property rights and or antitrust claims 
certain parties after receipt of an assertion of infringement will cut off all commercial relationships with the party making the assertion  thus making assertions against suppliers  customers  and key business partners risky 
if we forgo making such claims  we may run the risk of creating legal and equitable defenses for an infringer 
our participation in the digital display working group requires us to license some of our intellectual property for free  which may make it easier for others to compete with us in the dvi pc market 
we are a promoter of the ddwg  which published and promotes the dvi specification 
our strategy includes establishing the dvi specification as the industry standard  promoting and enhancing this specification and developing and marketing products based on this specification and future enhancements 
as a result we must license for free specific elements of our intellectual property to others for use in implementing the dvi specification  and we may license additional intellectual property for free as the ddwg promotes enhancements to the dvi specification 
accordingly  companies that implement the dvi specification in their products can use specific elements of our intellectual property for free to compete with us 

table of contents our participation as a founder in the working group developing hdmi requires us to license some of our intellectual property  which may make it easier for others to compete with us in the market 
in april  together with sony  philips  thomson  toshiba  matsushita and hitachi  we announced the formation of a working group to define the next generation digital interface specification for consumer electronics products 
version of the specification was published for adoption on december  the hdmi specification combines high definition video and multi channel audio in one digital interface and uses silicon image s patented underlying tmds technology  optionally  along with intel s hdcp as the basis for the interface 
the founders of the working group have signed a founder s agreement in which each commits to license certain intellectual property to each other  and to adopters of the specification 
our strategy includes establishing the hdmi specification as the industry standard  promoting and enhancing this specification and developing and marketing products based on this specification and future enhancements 
as a result we must license specific elements of our intellectual property to others for use in implementing the hdmi specification  and we may license additional intellectual property as the hdmi founders group promotes enhancements to the hdmi specification 
accordingly  companies that implement the hdmi specification in their products can use specific elements of our intellectual property to compete with us 
although there will be license fees and royalties associated with the adopters agreements  there can be no assurance that such license fees and royalties will adequately compensate us for having to license our intellectual property 
fees and royalties received during the early years of adoption will be used to cover costs we incur to promote the hdmi standard and to develop and perform interoperability tests  in addition  after an initial period  the hdmi founders may reallocate the license fees and royalties amongst themselves to reflect each founder s relative contribution of intellectual property to the hdmi specification 
our success depends on managing our relationship with intel 
intel has a dominant role in many of the markets in which we compete  such as pcs and storage  and is a growing presence in the ce market 
we have a multi faceted relationship with intel that is complex and requires significant management attention  including intel has been an investor of ours  intel and we have been parties to a business cooperation agreement  intel and we are parties to a patent cross license  intel and we worked together to develop hdcp  an intel subsidiary has the exclusive right to license hdcp  of which we are a licensee  intel and we were two of the original founders of the digital display working group ddwg  intel is a promoter of the serial ata working group  of which we are a contributor  intel is a supplier to us and a customer for our products  we believe that intel has the market presence to drive adoption of dvi and serial ata by making them widely available in its chipsets and motherboards  which could affect demand for our products  we believe that intel has the market presence to affect adoption of hdmi by either endorsing the technology or promulgating a competing standard  which could affect demand for our products  intel may potentially integrate the functionality of our products  including fibre channel  serial ata  dvi  or hdmi into its own chips and chipsets  thereby displacing demand for some of our products  
table of contents intel may design new technologies that would require us to re design our products for compatibility  thus increasing our r d expense and reducing our revenue  intel s technology  including its g chipset  may lower barriers to entry for other parties who may enter the market and compete with us  and intel may enter into or continue relationships with our competitors that can put us at a relative disadvantage 
our cooperation and competition with intel can lead to positive benefits  if managed effectively 
if our relationship with intel is not managed effectively  it could seriously harm our business  negatively affect our revenue  and increase our operating expenses 
we have granted intel rights with respect to our intellectual property  which could allow intel to develop products that compete with ours or otherwise reduce the value of our intellectual property 
we have entered into a patent cross license agreement with intel in which each of us granted the other a license to use the grantor s patents  except for identified types of products 
we believe that the scope of our license to intel excludes our current products and anticipated future products 
intel could  however  exercise its rights under this agreement to use our patents to develop and market other products that compete with ours  without payment to us 
additionally  intel s rights to our patents could reduce the value of our patents to any third party who otherwise might be interested in acquiring rights to use our patents in such products 
finally  intel could endorse competing products  including a competing digital interface  or develop its own proprietary digital interface 
any of these actions could substantially harm our business and results of operations 
we are and may continue to become the target of securities class action suits and derivative suits which could result in substantial costs and divert management attention and resources 
securities class action suits are often brought against companies  particularly technology companies  following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
defending against these suits  even if merit less  can result in substantial costs to us and could divert the attention of our management 
we and certain of our officers and directors  together with certain investment banks  have been named as defendants in a securities class action suit filed against us on behalf of purchasers of our securities between october  and december  it is alleged that the prospectus related to our initial public offering was misleading because it failed to disclose that the underwriters of our initial public offering had solicited and received excessive commissions from certain investors in exchange for agreements by investors to buy our shares in the aftermarket for predetermined prices 
due to inherent uncertainties in litigation  we cannot accurately predict the outcome of this litigation  however  a proposed settlement has been negotiated and has received preliminary approval by the court 
in the event that the settlement is not granted final approval  we believe that these claims are without merit and we intend to defend vigorously against them 
we and certain of our officers  together with certain investment banks and their current or former employees  were named as defendants in a securities class action suit filed against us on behalf of a putative class of shareholders who purchased stock from some or all of approximately issuers whose public offerings were underwritten by credit suisse first boston 
the lawsuit alleges that silicon image and certain officers were part of a scheme by credit suisse first boston to artificially inflate the price of silicon image s stock through the dissemination of allegedly false analysts reports 
the plaintiff in this matter has filed an amended complaint in which silicon image  and the named officers  was dropped as defendants 
we believe that the settlement described above  if approved  would encompass the claims in this case 
we believe that these claims were without merit and  if revived  and not subject to the settlement  we intend to defend vigorously against them 
certain of our officers and directors were named as defendants in consolidated shareholder derivative litigation 
the lawsuit alleged that as a result of the examination conducted by our audit committee  we would have been required to restate our financial results for and the lawsuit further alleges that such a restatement would be due to breaches by the individual defendants of their fiduciary duties to us  that certain of the individual defendants are liable to us for insider trading under california law  and that the 
table of contents individual defendants are liable to us for mismanagement  abuse of control  and waste 
we and certain of our officers were also named as defendants in consolidated securities class action litigation 
plaintiffs filed the action on behalf of a putative class of shareholders who purchased our stock between april  and november  the lawsuit alleges that we had materially overstated our licensing revenue  net income and financial results during this time period  and that were being forced to restate our financial results 
with the announcement by the audit committee of silicon image s board of directors that it has completed its examination and that it has concluded that no changes to silicon image s previously announced financial results are required  both the securities class action litigation and the shareholder derivative litigation have been dismissed 
silicon image and certain of its officers were named as defendants in a securities class action litigation captioned curry v 
silicon image  inc  steve tirado  and robert gargus  no 
c mmc  commenced on january  and pending in the united states district court for the northern district of california 
plaintiffs filed the action on behalf of a putative class of shareholders who purchased silicon image stock between october  and january  the lawsuit alleges that the company and certain of its officers and directors made alleged misstatements of material facts and violated certain provisions of sections a and b of the exchange act of and rule b promulgated thereunder 
the company intends to defend itself vigorously in this matter 
we are currently engaged in intellectual property litigation that is time consuming and expensive to prosecute 
we may become engaged in additional intellectual property litigation that could be time consuming  may be expensive to prosecute or defend  and could adversely affect our ability to sell our product 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states and in other jurisdictions involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
this litigation is particularly prevalent in the semiconductor industry  in which a number of companies aggressively use their patent portfolios to bring infringement claims 
in addition  in recent years  there has been an increase in the filing of so called nuisance suits  alleging infringement of intellectual property rights 
these claims may be asserted as counterclaims in response to claims made by a company alleging infringement of intellectual property rights 
these suits pressure defendants into entering settlement arrangements to quickly dispose of such suits  regardless of merit 
in addition  as is common in the semiconductor industry  from time to time we have been notified that we may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others 
responding to such claims  regardless of their merit  can be time consuming  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses 
as each claim is evaluated  we may consider the desirability of entering into settlement or licensing agreements 
no assurance can be given that settlements will occur or that licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur 
in the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products  or a successful claim of infringement against us requiring us to pay damages or royalties to a third party  and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in april  we filed suit against genesis microchip genesis for infringement of one of our us patents 
at that time  we also filed a complaint against genesis for unlawful trade practices related to the importation of articles infringing our patent 
in february  our motion to dismiss the unlawful trade practices complaint was granted and we filed an amended complaint against genesis alleging infringement of two of our us patents 
these patents relate to our dvi receiver products  which generate a significant portion of our revenue 
the amended complaint seeks a declaration that genesis has infringed our patents  that genesis behavior is not licensed  an injunction to halt the importation  sale  manufacture and use of genesis dvi receiver chips that infringe our patents  and monetary damages 
in april  genesis answered and made counterclaims against us for non infringement  license  patent invalidity  fraud  antitrust  unfair competition and patent misuse 
we filed a motion to dismiss certain of genesis s counterclaims 
in addition  we filed a motion to bifurcate trial of the counterclaims to the extent the court does not dismiss them 
in may  the court granted our motion to dismiss certain of the counterclaims  with leave to amend 
genesis 
table of contents re filed counterclaims against us for fraud and patent misuse 
we filed another motion to dismiss these counterclaims 
in august  the court granted our motion and dismissed genesis s re filed counterclaims with prejudice 
in december  the parties entered into a memorandum of understanding mou to settle the case 
when the parties failed to reach agreement on a final  definitive agreement as required by the mou  in january  the parties filed motions with the court to enforce their respective interpretations of the mou 
on july   the court granted our motion to interpret the mou in the manner we requested  and ruled that genesis had engaged in efforts to avoid its obligations under the mou 
on august   the court entered a final judgment order based on its july  ruling 
under the final judgment order  genesis was ordered to make a substantial cash payment  and to make royalty payments  although genesis has made and continues to make cash payments to the court  it may not have made all the payments that are required under the final judgment order 
we filed motions for reimbursement of some of our expenses  including some of our legal fees  and for modification and or clarification of certain items of the judgment  and to hold genesis in contempt of court for breaching the protective order in the case by disclosing secret information to at least one of our competitors 
on december   the court granted our motions in part and denied them in part the court issued an amended judgment  and held genesis in contempt of court for breaching the protective order 
on january   genesis filed a notice of appeal 
on august   the parties completed the filing of their respective appeal briefs 
on october   the court of appeals for the federal circuit issued an order setting the oral arguments for the appeal on december  the hearing took place as scheduled 
at the end of the hearing  the panel of federal circuit judges hearing the case stated that they believed that no final order had been issued by the trial court  and that therefore the federal circuit did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal 
the federal circuit issued its opinion on january  and  the federal circuit dismissed genesis appeal for lack of jurisdiction 
the federal circuit held that the parties agreement to settle the case  as embodied in the memorandum of understanding mou that was found by the lower court to be valid and enforceable  requires that genesis pay us a portion of the settlement as a condition to dismissing the case 
because the lower court allowed genesis to pay the amount into escrow instead of directly to us  the federal circuit held that the underlying claims asserted below remain pending  and therefore the judgment below is not final and is appealable 
there can be no assurance that genesis will not undertake further efforts to avoid its obligations under the mou  and that further proceedings lawsuits  contempt citations  etc 
against genesis  and certain of its executives  its counsel  and others may not be required to obtain compliance or to obtain redress for non compliance 
there can be no assurance that an appellate court will uphold the court s rulings or the mou 
there can be no assurance that further delays or noncompliance will not occur 
the court s rulings of july  and december  indicate that genesis violated certain provisions of the mou  and of the protective order in the case  including disclosure of confidential information to pixelworks 
on august   genesis and pixelworks issued a joint press release terminating their proposed merger 
in that press release  genesis and pixelworks jointly stated  pixelworks has confirmed that prior to signing the merger agreement  it reviewed the memorandum of understanding that purported to settle the lawsuit between genesis microchip and silicon image  inc while this litigation  including the appeal or any possible derivative proceedings  is pending  genesis may use the technology covered by these patents to develop products that might compete with ours 
if we are unsuccessful in this litigation  we could be unable to prevent genesis or others from using the technology covered by these patents 
even if we prevail in this litigation  uncertainties regarding the outcome prior to that time may reduce demand for our products  or genesis s use of our technology in products that compete with our products may reduce demand or pricing for our products 
in addition  even if the mou is upheld on appeal  future disputes may occur  including those regarding whether and what intellectual property licenses were granted and the scope of any such licenses and the royalty rates and payment terms for such licenses  whether the mou was breached  whether consent was fraudulently obtained  and whether a merger partner may succeed to the rights and or the obligations under the mou 
these disputes may result in additional costly and time consuming litigation or the license of additional elements of our intellectual property for free 

table of contents any potential intellectual property litigation against us could also force us to do one or more of the following stop selling products or using technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property  attempt to obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property  which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all  and attempt to redesign products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property 
if we take any of these actions  we may be unable to manufacture and sell our products 
we may be exposed to liability for monetary damages  the extent of which would be very difficult to accurately predict 
in addition  we may be exposed to customer claims  for potential indemnity obligations  and to customer dissatisfaction and a discontinuance of purchases of our products while the litigation is pending 
any of these consequences could substantially harm our business and results of operations 
we face additional risks and costs as a result of the delayed filing of our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september  and our recent audit committee examination 
as a result of the delayed filing of our form q for the quarter ended september   and the audit committee s examination  we have experienced additional risks and costs 
the audit committee s examination has been time consuming  required us to incur additional expenses and affected management s attention and resources 
further  the measures to strengthen internal controls already implemented or being implemented have and may continue to require greater management time and company resources to implement and monitor 
we incurred approximately million of costs associated with the audit committee examination in the fourth quarter of and an additional million in these costs included payments made by us pursuant to indemnity agreements between certain individuals and us 
we have entered into  and may again be required to enter into  patent or other intellectual property cross licenses 
many companies have significant patent portfolios or key specific patents  or other intellectual property in areas in which we compete 
many of these companies appear to have policies of imposing cross licenses on other participants in their markets  which may include areas in which we compete 
as a result  we have been required  either under pressure of litigation or by significant vendors or customers  to enter into cross licenses or non assertion agreements relating to patents or other intellectual property 
this permits the cross licensee  or beneficiary of a non assertion agreement  to use certain or all of our patents and or certain other intellectual property for free to compete with us 
we must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful  and competition for qualified personnel is increasing in our market 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued contributions of our key management  technical and sales personnel  many of who would be difficult to replace 
the loss of one or more of these employees could harm our business 
although we have entered into a limited number of employment contracts with certain executive officers  we generally do not have employment contracts with our key employees 
we do not have key person life insurance for any of our key personnel 
our success also depends on our ability to identify  attract and retain qualified technical  sales  marketing  finance and managerial personnel 
competition for qualified personnel is particularly intense in our industry and in our location 
this makes it difficult to retain our key personnel and to recruit highly qualified personnel 
we have experienced  and may continue to experience  difficulty in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications 
to be successful  we need to hire candidates with appropriate qualifications and retain our key executives and employees 
replacing departing executive officers and key employees can involve organizational disruption and uncertain timing 
the volatility of our stock price has had an impact on our ability to offer competitive equity based incentives to current and prospective employees  thereby affecting our ability to attract and retain highly 
table of contents qualified technical personnel 
if these adverse conditions continue  we may not be able to hire or retain highly qualified employees in the future and this could harm our business 
in addition  new regulations adopted by the nasdaq national market requiring shareholder approval for all stock option plans  as well as new regulations adopted by the new york stock exchange prohibiting nyse member organizations from giving a proxy to vote on equity compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has given voting instructions  could make it more difficult for us to grant options to employees in the future 
there have been several proposals on whether and or how to account for stock options 
to the extent that new regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant options to employees  we may incur increased cash compensation costs or find it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  either of which could harm our business 
we use contractors to provide services to the company  which often involves contractual complexity  tax and employment law compliance  and being subject to audits and other governmental actions 
we have been audited for our contracting policies in the past  and may be in the future 
burdening our ability to freely use contractors to provide services to the company may increase the expense of obtaining such services  and or require us to discontinue using contractors and attempt to find  interview  and hire employees to provide similar services 
such potential employees may not be available in a reasonable time  or at all  or may not be hired without undue cost 
we have experienced management transitions in the past and may continue to do so in the future 
we have experienced a number of transitions with respect to our board of directors and executive officers in recent quarters  including the following in april  steve tirado moved from the position of president to division president of storage group  jaime garcia meza moved from the position of vice president of worldwide sales to vice president of sales and marketing for storage platforms  rob valiton was appointed as vice president of worldwide sales  and chris paisley was appointed to the board of directors in august  the company announced that robert gargus planned to retire from the position of chief financial officer and dale brown  the controller of the company  was appointed as chief accounting officer 
although an executive search is underway  the timing of appointment of a successor to mr 
gargus is uncertain 
in september  parviz khodi  the vice president  pc display products of the company  passed away unexpectedly and his duties were subsequently assumed by john lemoncheck  the vice president  ce products and patrick reutens was appointed as chief legal officer of the company 
in november  david lee resigned from the positions of chief executive officer and president  steve laub was appointed as chief executive officer and president and to the board of directors as well  and andrew rappaport and douglas spreng resigned from the board of directors 
in january  steve laub resigned from the positions of chief executive officer and president and from the board of directors  steve tirado was appointed as chief executive officer and president and to the board as well  and chris paisley was appointed chairman of the board of directors 
in february  jaime garcia meza was appointed as vice president of our storage business 
past and future transitions with respect to our board and executives may result in disruptions in our management and operations and additional costs 
industry cycles may strain our management and resources 
cycles of growth and contraction in our industry may strain our management and resources 
to manage these industry cycles effectively  we must improve operational and financial systems  train and manage our employee base  
table of contents successfully integrate operations and employees of businesses we acquire or have acquired  attract  develop  motivate and retain qualified personnel with relevant experience  and adjust spending levels according to prevailing market conditions 
if we cannot manage industry cycles effectively  our business could be seriously harmed 
our operations and the operations of our significant customers  third party wafer foundries and third party assembly and test subcontractors are located in areas susceptible to natural disasters 
our operations are headquartered in the san francisco bay area  which is susceptible to earthquakes  and the operations of cmd  which we acquired  are based in the los angeles area  which is also susceptible to earthquakes 
tsmc and umc  the outside foundries that produce the majority of our semiconductor products  are located in taiwan 
advanced semiconductor engineering  or ase  one of the subcontractors that assembles and tests our semiconductor products  is also located in taiwan 
for the years ended december    and customers and distributors located in taiwan generated   and of our revenue  respectively  and customers and distributors located in japan generated   and of our revenue  respectively 
both taiwan and japan are susceptible to earthquakes  typhoons and other natural disasters 
our business would be negatively affected if any of the following occurred an earthquake or other disaster in the san francisco bay area or the los angeles area damaged our facilities or disrupted the supply of water or electricity to our headquarters or our irvine facility  an earthquake  typhoon or other disaster in taiwan or japan resulted in shortages of water  electricity or transportation  limiting the production capacity of our outside foundries or the ability of ase to provide assembly and test services  an earthquake  typhoon or other disaster in taiwan or japan damaged the facilities or equipment of our customers and distributors  resulting in reduced purchases of our products  or an earthquake  typhoon or other disaster in taiwan or japan disrupted the operations of suppliers to our taiwanese or japanese customers  outside foundries or ase  which in turn disrupted the operations of these customers  foundries or ase and resulted in reduced purchases of our products or shortages in our product supply 
changes in environmental rules and regulations could increase our costs and reduce our revenue 
several jurisdictions are considering whether to implement rules that would require that certain products  including semiconductors  be made lead free 
we anticipate that some jurisdictions may finalize and enact such requirements 
some jurisdictions are also considering whether to require abatement or disposal obligations for products made prior to the enactment of any such rules 
although several of our products are available to customers in a lead free condition  most of our products are not lead free 
any requirement that would prevent or burden the development  manufacture or sales of lead containing semiconductors would likely reduce our revenue for such products and would require us to incur costs to develop substitute lead free replacement products  which may take time and may not always be economically or technically feasible  and may require disposal of non compliant inventory 
in addition  any requirement to dispose or abate previously sold products would require us to incur the costs of setting up and implementing such a program 

table of contents provisions of our charter documents and delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control  and may reduce the market price of our common stock 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable 
these provisions include authorizing the issuance of preferred stock without stockholder approval  providing for a classified board of directors with staggered  three year terms  requiring advance notice of stockholder nominations for the board of directors  providing the board of directors the opportunity to expand the number of directors without notice to stockholders  prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors  requiring super majority voting to amend some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders  and prohibiting stockholder actions by written consent 
provisions of delaware law also may discourage  delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 
the price of our stock fluctuates substantially and may continue to do so 
the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market valuation of many technology companies  including silicon image 
these factors  as well as general economic and political conditions  may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly and may continue to fluctuate in response to a number of factors  including  but not limited to actual or anticipated changes in our operating results  changes in expectations of our future financial performance  changes in market valuations of comparable companies in our markets  changes in market valuations or expectations of future financial performance of our vendors or customers  changes in our key executives and technical personnel  and announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations  design wins  contracts  standards or acquisitions 
due to these factors  the price of our stock may decline 
in addition  the stock market experiences volatility that is often unrelated to the performance of particular companies 
these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to decline regardless of our performance 
continued terrorist attacks or war could lead to further economic instability and adversely affect our operations  results of operations and stock price 
the united states has taken  and continues to take  military action against terrorism and has engaged in war with iraq and currently has an occupation force there and in afghanistan 
in addition  the current nuclear arms crises in north korea and iran could escalate into armed hostilities or war 
acts of terrorism or armed hostilities may disrupt or result in instability in the general economy and financial markets and in consumer demand for the oem s products that incorporate our products 
disruptions and instability in the general economy could reduce demand for our products or disrupt the operations of our customers  suppliers  
table of contents distributors and contractors  many of whom are located in asia  which would in turn adversely affect our operations and results of operations 
disruptions and instability in financial markets could adversely affect our stock price

we indemnify certain of our licensing customers against infringement 
we indemnify certain of our licensing agreements customers for any expenses or liabilities resulting from third party claims of infringements of patent  trademark  trade secret  or copyright rights by the technology we license 
certain of these indemnification provisions are perpetual from execution of the agreement and  in some instances  the maximum amount of potential future indemnification is not limited 
to date  we have not paid any such claims or been required to defend any lawsuits with respect to any claim 
in the event that we were required to defend any lawsuits with respect to our indemnification obligations  or to pay any claim  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures of market risk equity investments we are exposed to equity price risk on our portfolio of marketable equity securities 
as of december   the market value of our equity investment was approximately million compared to million as of june   a decrease of 
we believe that it is reasonably possible that the fair values of these securities could adversely change in the near term 
we have a policy in place to review our equity holdings on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not such securities has experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value 
our policy includes  but is not limited to  reviewing each company s cash position  earnings revenue outlook  stock price performance over the past six months  liquidity and management ownership 
if we believe that an other than temporary decline in value exists in one of our marketable equity securities  it is our policy to write down these equity investments to the market value and record the related write down in our consolidated statements of operations 
fixed income investments as of december   we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities as reported in short term investments  including those classified as cash equivalents of approximately million 
these securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of our fixed income investments 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of december  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the 
table of contents hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus   or basis points over a twelve month time horizon 
the following represents the potential decrease to the value of our fixed income securities given a negative shift in the yield curve used in our sensitivity analysis in thousands 
we limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and monitoring clear policies and guidelines of our fixed income portfolios 
the guidelines also establish credit quality standards  limits on exposure to any one security issue  limits on exposure to any one issuer and limits on exposure to the type of instrument 
due to limited duration and credit risk criteria established in our guidelines we do not expect the exposure to interest rate risk and credit risk to be material 
market price components of our stock compensation expense are tied to our stock price 
changes in our stock price can have a significant affect on the amount recorded as stock compensation expense 
foreign currency exchange risk all of our sales are denominated in us dollars  and substantially all of our expenses are incurred in us dollars  thus limiting our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
we currently do not enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies and do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the direct effect of an immediate change in foreign currency exchange rates should not have a material effect on our future operating results or cash flows  however  a long term increase in foreign currency rates would likely result in increased wafer  packaging  assembly or testing costs 
additionally  many of our foreign distributors price our products in the local currency of the countries in which they sell 
therefore  significant strengthening of the us dollar relative to those foreign currencies could result in reduced demand or lower us dollar prices for our products  which would negatively affect our operating results
