item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies in preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company is impacted by factors such as the continued receipt of contracts from the us government and industrial partners  its ability to protect and maintain the proprietary nature of its technology  its continued product and technological advances and the strength and ability of the company s licensees and joint venture partners to commercialize the company s products and technologies 
warranty liability the company estimates the liability for product warranty costs based upon its past experience and best estimate of future warranty claims 
warranty liability is recorded at the time that the product is sold for sales of photovoltaic products or at the time that revenue is recognized for machine building and equipment sales 
allowance for uncollectible accounts the company maintains an allowance for uncollectible accounts considering a number of factors  including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  previous loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligation  and the condition of the general economy and industry as a whole 
impairment of long lived assets the company compares the carrying value of its long lived assets with the estimated undiscounted cash flows or fair value associated with these assets 
if the carrying value of the long lived assets is more than the estimated undiscounted cash flows or fair value  then an impairment loss is recorded 
government contract liability the company s contracts with the us government and its agencies are subject to audits by the defense contract audit agency dcaa 
the company  based on its review of dcaa audit reports  records an estimated reserve for items questioned by dcaa 
principles of consolidation and equity accounting the company s investments in cobasys and ovonyx are recorded at zero 
the company will continue to carry its investment in each of these joint ventures at zero until the venture becomes profitable based upon the venture s history of sustainable profits  at which time the company will start to recognize over a period of years its share  if any  of the then equity of each of the ventures  and will recognize its share of each venture s profits or losses on the equity method of accounting 
to the extent that the company has made contributions  other than technology  it recognizes its proportionate share of any losses until the investment reaches zero 
the company has three joint ventures  rare earth ovonic  with rare earth high tech co 
ltd 
of baotou steel company of inner mongolia  china  for the manufacture of batteries and other related products and components 
the company accounts for its interest in each of these joint ventures using the cost method of accounting 
while the company believes  based upon the opinion of legal counsel  that it has no obligation to fund any losses that its joint ventures incur beyond the company s investment  the company has decided to fund limited amounts for certain of its joint ventures see note e of notes to consolidated financial statements 
product sales product sales include revenues related to photovoltaic products  machine building and equipment sales contracts and nickel hydroxide 
revenues related to most machine building and equipment sales contracts and sales related to other long term contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting using the costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated costs 
all other product sales are recognized when the product is delivered to the customer 
generally  this is upon shipment from the factory as most products are shipped fob shipping point 
some foreign customers are shipped under ddp terms where the customer takes delivery at the point of destination 
all intersegment sales are eliminated in consolidation 
royalties most license agreements  other than the amended mei battery agreement see note e of notes to consolidated financial statements and those granted to certain joint ventures  provide for the company to receive royalties from the sale of products which utilize the licensed technology 
typically  the royalties are incremental to and distinct from the license fee and are recognized as revenue upon the sale of the respective licensed product 
in several instances  the company has received cash payments for nonrefundable advance royalty payments which are creditable against future royalties under the licenses 
advance royalty payments are deferred and recognized in revenues as the creditable sales occur  the underlying agreement expires  or when the company has demonstrable evidence that no additional royalties will be creditable and  accordingly  the earnings process is completed 
business agreements revenues are also derived through business agreements for the development and or commercialization of products based upon the company s proprietary technologies 
the company has two major types of business agreements 
the first type of business agreement relates to licensing the company s proprietary technology 
licensing activities are tailored to provide each licensee with the right to use the company s technology  most of which is patented  for a specific product application or  in some instances  for further exploration of new product applications of such technologies 
the terms of such licenses  accordingly  are tailored to address a number of circumstances relating to the use of such technology which have been negotiated between the company and the licensee 
such terms generally address whether the license will be exclusive or nonexclusive  whether the licensee is limited to very narrowly defined applications or to broader based product manufacture or sale of products using such technologies  whether the license will provide royalties for products sold which employ such licensed technology and how such royalties will be measured  as well as other factors specific to each negotiated arrangement 
in some cases  licenses relate directly to product development that the company has undertaken pursuant to product development agreements  in other cases  they relate to product development and commercialization efforts of the licensee  and other agreements combine the efforts of the company with those of the licensee 
license agreement fees are generally recognized as revenue at the time the agreements are consummated  which is the completion of the earnings process 
typically  such fees are nonrefundable  do not obligate the company to incur any future costs or require future performance by the company  and are not related to future production or earnings of the licensee 
in some instances  a portion of such license fees is contingent upon the commencement of production or other uncertainties 
in these cases  license fee revenues are not recognized until commencement of production or the resolution of uncertainties 
generally  there are no current or future direct costs associated with license fees 
in the second type of agreement  product development agreements  the company conducts specified product development projects related to one of its principal technology specializations for an agreed upon fee 
some of these projects have stipulated performance criteria and deliverables whereas others require best efforts with no specified performance criteria 
revenues from product development agreements  where there are no specific performance terms  are recognized in amounts equal to the amounts expended on the programs 
generally  the agreed upon fees for product development agreements contemplate reimbursing the company  after its agreed upon cost share  if any  for costs considered associated with project activities including expenses for direct product development and research  patents  operating  general and administrative expenses and depreciation 
accordingly  expenses related to product development agreements are recorded as cost of revenues from product development agreements

during fiscal year  the company began to implement a restructuring plan approved by the board of directors to take full advantage of the favorable battery settlement agreement announced on july  and the increasing market interest in solar energy systems and hevs 
our strategy is to transition from a highly successful research oriented company to the next phase of development  which is to commercialize the products we have developed and concentrate on growing sales revenues and equity value in our core commercial businesses 
the company intends to continue its restructuring activities in fiscal  including securing revenues to finance its hydrogen  fuel cell and other technologies  sale of the assets of the metal hydride materials business and vacating three facilities  with the goal of moving the company into a position of having sustained profitability 
the restructuring is expected to increase other product revenues while enabling us to carry out major cost reduction measures  including significant reductions in the workforce to right size activities to support our core commercial businesses 
we will manage a reduced portfolio of advanced product development activities and a leaner r d team to grow future businesses 
in addition  the company has commenced construction of a new united solar ovonic mw machine  which is anticipated to be completed by fall at a total cost of  the core commercial businesses on which the company is focusing are our wholly owned subsidiary  united solar ovonic  and our joint ventures  cobasys and ovonyx 
the company expects the amount of cash to be received under existing product development agreements in the year ending june  to decrease to approximately  compared to  received in the year ended june   due to reduced funding to be received in the year ending june  from chevron 
certain of the company s product development and product purchase agreements contain provisions allowing for the termination of such agreements for  among other things  failure of the company to meet agreement milestones or for breach of material contractual provisions 
generally  the termination provisions allow for the company to recover any costs incurred through the termination date 
the following table delineates the company s contractual obligations payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years capital lease obligations      capital lease commitment     operating leases      purchase obligations    total      as part of its long standing strategy  the company has made investments in its technologies  which have resulted in enabling intellectual property and products 
the technology emerging from these investments has enabled the company to finance its operations and growth through strategic alliances joint venture license and development agreements with third parties who can provide financial and other resources and expertise for the company s technologies and products 
management believes that funds generated from operations  new business agreements  exercises of common stock purchase warrants and stock options  cost containment initiatives  and existing cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to support and finance planned growth  capital expenditures and company sponsored product development programs over the coming year 
the company is evaluating a number of alternatives to accelerate the growth of its businesses by increasing its manufacturing capacity 
in order to fund this accelerated growth  the company is exploring many alternatives including  but not limited to  equity and debt financing and new business agreements 
the company is also in discussions with potential partners to fund its various activities 
no assurances can be given as to the time or success of the aforementioned plans  negotiations  discussions and programs 
the december agreement with chevron provides a mechanism for additional funding from chevron to continue the cobasys expansion 
chevron will be entitled to priority right of repayment for providing the additional funding 
ecd and chevron will each continue to own a interest in cobasys subject to adjustment under certain circumstances 
in a separate december agreement with chevron  chevron transferred its interest in ovonic hydrogen systems to ecd in consideration of relieving chevron of continuing funding obligations 
ecd is currently funding of ovonic hydrogen systems requirements at a reduced level 
the commercialization of the company s ovonic unified memory through the ovonyx joint venture does not require financial support because ovonyx has generated sufficient funds for its operations through licensing activities
