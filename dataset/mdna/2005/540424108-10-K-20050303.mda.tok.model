cna follows a consistent and systematic process for impairing securities that sustain other than temporary declines in value 
cna has established a committee responsible for the impairment process 
this committee  referred to as the impairment committee  is made up of three officers appointed by cna s chief financial officer 
the impairment committee is responsible for analyzing watch list securities on at least a quarterly basis 
the watch list includes individual securities that fall below certain thresholds or that exhibit evidence of impairment indicators including  but not limited to  a significant adverse change in the financial condition and near term prospects of the investment or a significant adverse change in legal factors  the business climate or credit ratings 
when a security is placed on the watch list  it is monitored for further fair value changes and additional news related to the issuer s financial condition 
the focus is on objective evidence that may influence the evaluation of impairment factors 
the decision to impair a security incorporates both quantitative criteria and qualitative information 
the impairment committee considers a number of factors including  but not limited to a the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than book value  b the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  c the intent and ability of cna to retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in value  d whether the debtor is current on interest and principal payments and e general market conditions and industry or sector specific factors 
the impairment committee s decision to impair a security is primarily based on whether the security s fair value is likely to remain significantly below its book value in light of all of the factors considered 
for securities that are impaired  the security is written down to fair value and the resulting losses are recognized in realized gains losses in the consolidated statements of operations 
realized investment losses included million  million and million of pretax impairment losses for the three years ended december   and the and impairments were primarily the result of the continued credit deterioration on specific issuers in the bond and equity markets and the effects on such markets due to the overall slowing of the economy 
for the year ended december   the impairment losses recorded related largely to loans made under a credit facility to a national contractor  that are classified as fixed maturities 
see the loans to national contractor section of the md a 
for  the impairment losses recorded related primarily to corporate bonds in the airline  healthcare and energy industries 
for  the impairment losses recorded related primarily to corporate bonds in the communications industry sectors including million related to worldcom inc  million related to adelphia communication corporation  million for charter communications  million for at t canada and million for telewest plc 
during  cna reduced the impairment loss related to the sale of cna re uk by approximately million after tax and minority interest 
cna s non investment grade fixed maturity securities held as of december  that were in an unrealized loss position had a fair value of million 
as discussed previously  a significant judgment in the valuation of investments is the determination of when an other than temporary impairment has occurred 
cna s impairment committee analyzes securities placed on the watch list on at least a quarterly basis 
part of this analysis is to monitor the length of time and severity of the decline below book value of the watch list securities 
the following table summarizes the fair value and gross unrealized loss of non investment grade securities categorized by the length of time those securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position and further categorized by the severity of the unrealized loss position in increments as of december  and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations investments continued estimated fair value as a percentage of book value unrealized december  fair value loss in millions fixed maturity securities non investment grade months months months greater than months total non investment grade december  fixed maturity securities non investment grade months months months greater than months total non investment grade as part of the ongoing impairment monitoring process  the impairment committee has evaluated the facts and circumstances based on available information for each of the non investment grade securities and determined that no further impairments were appropriate at december  this determination was based on a number of factors that the impairment committee regularly considers including  but not limited to the issuers ability to meet current and future interest and principal payments  an evaluation of the issuers financial condition and near term prospects  and cna s sector outlook and estimates of the fair value of any underlying collateral 
in all cases where a decline in value is judged to be temporary  cna has the intent and ability to hold these securities for a period of time sufficient to recover the book value of its investment through a recovery in the fair value of such securities or by holding the securities to maturity 
in many cases  the securities held are matched to liabilities as part of ongoing asset liability duration management 
as such  the impairment committee continually assesses its ability to hold securities for a time sufficient to recover any temporary loss in value or until maturity 
cna maintains sufficient levels of liquidity so as to not impact the asset liability management process 
cna s equity securities held as of december  that were in an unrealized loss position had a fair value of million 
cna s impairment committee  under the same process as followed for fixed maturity securities  monitors the equity securities for other than temporary declines in value 
in all cases where a decline in value is judged to be temporary  cna expects to recover the book value of its investment through a recovery in the fair value of the security 
invested assets are exposed to various risks  such as interest rate  market and credit risk 
due to the level of risk associated with certain invested assets and the level of uncertainty related to changes in the value of these assets  it is possible that changes in these risks in the near term  including increases in interest rates  could have an adverse material impact on the company s results of operations or equity 
the general account portfolio consists primarily of high quality bonds  and of which were rated as investment grade bbb or higher at december  and  respectively

the remaining bonds were rated by other rating agencies or cna management 
non investment grade bonds  as presented in the tables above  are high yield securities rated below bbb by bond rating agencies  as well as other unrated securities that  in the opinion of cna management  are below investment grade 
high yield securities generally involve a greater degree of risk than investment grade securities 
however  expected returns should compensate for the added risk 
this risk is also considered in the interest rate assumptions for the underlying insurance products 
the carrying value of non traded securities at december  was million which represents of cna s total investment portfolio 
these securities were in a net unrealized gain position of million at december  of the non traded securities  are priced by unrelated third party sources 
included in cna s general account fixed maturity securities at december  are  million of asset backed securities  at fair value  consisting of approximately in collateralized mortgage obligations cmos  in corporate mortgage backed pass through certificates  in corporate asset backed obligations and in us government agency issued pass through certificates

 share based payment sfas no 
r  which covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements  including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans 
sfas no 
r requires companies to use the fair value method in accounting for employee stock options which results in compensation expense recorded in the income statement 
compensation expense is measured at the grant date using an option pricing model and is recognized over the service period  which is usually the vesting period 
sfas no 
r is effective for reporting periods beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
r is not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations or equity 
in march of  the emerging issues task force eitf reached consensus on the guidance provided in eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf  as applicable to debt and equity securities that are within the scope of sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and equity securities that are accounted for using the cost method specified in accounting principles board opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
under eitf an investment is impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its cost including adjustments for amortization  accretion  foreign exchange and hedging 
an impairment would be considered other than temporary unless a the investor has the ability and intent to hold an investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient for the recovery of the fair value up to or beyond the cost of the investment and b evidence indicating that the cost of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs evidence to the contrary 
this new guidance for determining whether impairment is other than temporary was to be effective for reporting periods beginning after june  in september of  the fasb issued fasb staff position eitf issue  which suspended the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance included in eitf issue related to other than temporary impairment until additional implementation guidance is provided 
pending adoption of a final rule  the company continued to apply existing accounting literature for determining when a decline in fair value is other than temporary 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations accounting standards continued the company continues to evaluate the impact of this new accounting standard on its process for determining other than temporary impairment of equity and fixed maturity securities  including the potential impacts from any revisions to the original guidance issued 
adoption of this standard as originally issued may cause the company to recognize impairment losses in the consolidated statements of operations which would not have been recognized under the current guidance or to recognize such losses in earlier periods  especially those due to increases in interest rates  and could also impact the recognition of investment income on impaired securities 
such an impact would likely increase earnings volatility in future periods 
however  since fluctuations in the fair value for available for sale securities are already recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on equity

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is a large diversified financial services company 
as such  it and its subsidiaries have significant amounts of financial instruments that involve market risk 
the company s measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of its financial instruments 
changes in the trading portfolio would be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
market risk exposure is presented for each class of financial instrument held by the company at december  assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below 
the company believes that the various rates of adverse market movements represent a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions 
the estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected actual loss  even under adverse conditions  because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ 
in addition  since the company s investment portfolio is subject to change based on its portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market  these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results which may occur 
exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by senior management 
senior management approves the overall investment strategy employed by the company and has responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy and the level of risk acceptable to it 
the company may manage risk by buying or selling instruments or entering into offsetting positions 
interest rate risk the company has exposure to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates 
the company attempts to mitigate its exposure to interest rate risk by utilizing instruments such as interest rate swaps  interest rate caps  commitments to purchase securities  options  futures and forwards 
the company monitors its sensitivity to interest rate risk by evaluating the change in the value of its financial assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates 
the evaluation is performed by applying an instantaneous change in interest rates by varying magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in rates would have on the recorded market value of the company s investments and the resulting effect on shareholders equity 
the analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value of the company s financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices which the company believes are reasonably possible over a one year period 
the sensitivity analysis estimates the change in the market value of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities that were held on december  and due to instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve of basis points  with all other variables held constant 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
accordingly the analysis may not be indicative of  is not intended to provide  and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes of market interest rates on the company s earnings or shareholders equity 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the company could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
the company s debt  as of december  and is denominated in us dollars 
the company s debt has been primarily issued at fixed rates  and as such  interest expense would not be impacted by interest rate shifts 
the impact of a basis point increase in interest rates on fixed rate debt would result in a decrease in market value of million and million  respectively 
a basis point decrease would result in an increase in market value of million and million  respectively 
equity price risk the company has exposure to equity price risk as a result of its investment in equity securities and equity derivatives 
equity price risk results from changes in the level or volatility of equity prices which affect the value of equity securities or instruments that derive their value from such securities or indexes 
equity price risk was measured assuming an instantaneous change in the underlying reference price or index from its level at december  and  with all other variables held constant 
foreign exchange rate risk foreign exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments 
the company has foreign exchange rate exposure when it buys or sells foreign currencies or financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency 
this exposure is mitigated by the company s asset liability matching strategy and through the use of futures for those instruments which are not matched 
the company s foreign transactions are primarily denominated in canadian dollars  british pounds and the european monetary unit 
the sensitivity analysis also assumes an instantaneous change in the foreign currency item a

commodity price risk the company has exposure to commodity price risk as a result of its investments in gold options 
commodity price risk results from changes in the level or volatility of commodity prices that impact instruments which derive their value from such commodities 
commodity price risk was measured assuming an instantaneous change of from their levels at december  and the following tables present the company s market risk by category equity markets  interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices on the basis of those entered into for trading purposes and other than trading purposes
