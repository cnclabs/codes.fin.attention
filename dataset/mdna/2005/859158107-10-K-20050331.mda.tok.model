page sterling bancorp management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following commentary presents management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of sterling bancorp the parent company  a financial holding company under the gramm leach bliley act of  and its subsidiaries  principally sterling national bank the bank 
throughout this discussion and analysis  the term the company refers to sterling bancorp and its subsidiaries 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and selected financial data contained elsewhere in this annual report 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the financial statements for each of the years and a have been restated to correct the accounting for employee benefits expense so as to comply with apb opinion no 
 as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  and fasb technical bulletin  accounting for purchases of life insurance  and b also reflect other accounting revisions and adjustments  which were made after march   the date of filing of the company s form k dated march  in addition  certain reclassifications have been made to prior years financial data to conform to current financial statement presentations as well as to reflect the effect of the six for five stock split in the form of a stock dividend effected on december  critical accounting policies and estimates the accounting and reporting policies followed by the company conform  in all material respects  to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management has made estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated statements of condition and results of operations for the periods indicated 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
the company s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note beginning on page the company has identified its policies on the allowance for loan losses and income tax liabilities to be critical because management has to make subjective and or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
additional information on these policies can be found in note the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses is outlined in note and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included under asset quality beginning on page the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could impact the company s consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
additional discussion on the accounting for income taxes is presented in note beginning on page and in note on page overview the company provides a broad range of financial products and services  including business and consumer loans  commercial and residential mortgage lending and brokerage  asset based financing  factoring accounts receivable management services  deposit services  trade financing  equipment leasing  deposit services  trust and estate administration  and investment management services 
the company has operations in the metropolitan new york area  virginia and north carolina  and conducts business throughout the united states 
the general state of the us economy and  in particular  economic and market conditions in the metropolitan new york area have a significant impact on loan demand  the ability of borrowers to repay these loans and the value of any collateral securing these loans and may also affect deposit levels 
accordingly  future general economic conditions are a key uncertainty that management expects will materially affect the company s results of operations 
in  the bank s average earning assets represented approximately of the company s average earning assets 
loans represented and investment securities represented of the bank s average earning assets in page the company s primary source of earnings is net interest income  and its principal market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the company is not able to predict market interest rate fluctuations  and its asset liability management strategy may not prevent interest rate changes from having a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
although management endeavors to minimize the credit risk inherent in the company s loan portfolio  it must necessarily make various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of the loan portfolio based on its experience and evaluation of economic conditions 
if such assumptions or judgments prove to be incorrect  the current allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover loan losses and additions to the allowance may be necessary  which would have a negative impact on net income 
there is intense competition in all areas in which the company conducts its business 
the company competes with banks and other financial institutions  including savings and loan associations  savings banks  finance companies  and credit unions 
many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits and provide a wider array of banking services 
to a limited extent  the company also competes with other providers of financial services  such as money market mutual funds  brokerage firms  consumer finance companies and insurance companies 
competition is based on a number of factors  including prices  interest rates  service  availability of products  and geographic location 
the company regularly evaluates acquisition opportunities and conducts due diligence activities in connection with possible acquisitions 
as a result  acquisition discussions  and in some cases negotiations  regularly take place and future acquisitions could occur 
income statement analysis net interest income  which represents the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest incurred on interest bearing liabilities  is the company s primary source of earnings 
net interest income can be affected by changes in market interest rates as well as the level and composition of assets  liabilities and shareholders equity 
net interest spread is the difference between the average rate earned  on a tax equivalent basis  on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the net yield on interest earning assets net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax equivalent net interest income by average interest earning assets 
generally  the net interest margin will exceed the net interest spread because a portion of interest earning assets are funded by various noninterest bearing sources  principally noninterest bearing deposits and shareholders equity 
the increases decreases in the components of interest income and interest expense  expressed in terms of fluctuation in average volume and rate  are provided in the rate volume analysis shown on page information as to the components of interest income and interest expense and average rates is provided in the average balance sheets shown on page comparison of years and the company reported net income for the year ended december  of million  representing per share  calculated on a diluted basis  compared to million  or per share calculated on a diluted basis  for this increase reflects continued growth in both net interest income and noninterest income and a lower provision for income taxes  which more than offset increases in the provision for loan losses and noninterest expenses 
net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  increased million to million for from million for  due to higher average earning assets outstanding coupled with lower average cost of funding partially offset by a lower yield on earning assets and higher average interest bearing deposit balances

provision for loan losses based on management s continuing evaluation of the loan portfolio discussed under asset quality below  the provision for loan losses for increased to million from million for the prior year period 
factors affecting the level of provision for loan losses included the growth in the loan portfolios  changes in general economic conditions and the amount of nonaccrual loans 
noninterest income noninterest income increased to million for from million in  primarily due to increased income from mortgage banking  principally the result of a change in the mix of loans sold due to a broader array of loan products and an increased focus on higher margin mortgage loans  and from factoring activities  from bank owned life insurance and from gains on sales of available for sale securities 
partially offsetting these increases were lower revenues from fees for deposit  trade finance and various other services 
noninterest expenses noninterest expenses increased million for when compared to the increase was primarily due to investments in the sterling franchise  including the new branches  and regulatory compliance costs  with higher expenses related to salaries and employee benefits  advertising and marketing  and professional fees 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased million for when compared to the lower provision for taxes in the period was primarily due to the resolution  during the second quarter of  of certain state tax issues for tax years comparison of years and the company reported net income for the year ended december  of million  representing per share  calculated on a diluted basis  compared to million  or per share  calculated on a diluted basis  for this increase reflected continued growth in both net interest income and noninterest income  which together with a lower provision for loan losses  more than offset increases in noninterest expenses and the provision for income taxes

given the generally high credit quality of the portfolio  management expects to realize all of its investment upon the maturity of such instruments  and thus believes that any market value impairment is temporary 
information regarding book values and range of maturities by type of security and weighted average yields for totals of each category is presented in note beginning on page page the following table sets forth the composition of the company s investment securities by type  with related carrying values at the end of each of the three most recent fiscal years december  of of of balances total balances total balances total dollars in thousands us treasury securities    obligations of us government corporations and agencies mortgage backed securities    collateralized mortgage obligations    other securities  obligations of states and political subdivisions    trust preferred securities    debt securities issued by foreign governments    other debt securities   federal reserve bank and other equity securities    total    loan portfolio a management objective is to maintain the quality of the loan portfolio 
the company seeks to achieve this objective by maintaining rigorous underwriting standards coupled with regular evaluation of the creditworthiness of and the designation of lending limits for each borrower 
the portfolio strategies include seeking industry and loan size diversification in order to minimize credit exposure and the origination of loans in markets with which the company is familiar 
the company s commercial and industrial loan portfolio represents approximately of all loans 
loans in this category are typically made to individuals  small and medium sized businesses and range between  and million 
the company s leasing portfolio  which consists of finance leases for various types of business equipment  represents approximately of all loans 
the leasing and commercial and industrial loan portfolios are included in corporate lending for segment reporting purposes as presented in note beginning on page the company s real estate loan portfolio  which represents approximately of all loans  is secured by mortgages on real property located principally in the states of new york  new jersey  virginia and north carolina 
sources of repayment are from the borrower s operating profits  cash flows and liquidation of pledged collateral 
based on underwriting standards  loans and leases may be secured whole or in part by collateral such as liquid assets  accounts receivable  equipment  inventory  and real property 
the collateral securing any loan or lease may depend on the type of loan and may vary in value based on market conditions

asset quality intrinsic to the lending process is the possibility of loss 
in times of economic slowdown  the risk of loss inherent in the company s portfolio of loans may be increased 
while management endeavors to minimize this risk  it recognizes that loan losses will occur and that the amount of these losses will fluctuate depending on the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio which in turn depend on current and expected economic conditions  the financial condition of borrowers  the realization of collateral  and the credit management process 
the following table sets forth the amount of domestic nonaccrual and past due loans of the company at the end of each of the five most recent fiscal years  there were no foreign loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis and there were no troubled debt restructurings for any types of loans 
loans contractually past due days or more as to principal or interest and still accruing are loans that are both well secured or guaranteed by financially responsible third parties and are in the process of collection

the allowance for loan losses is maintained through the provision for loan losses  which is a charge to operating earnings 
the adequacy of the provision and the resulting allowance for loan losses is determined by a management evaluation process of the loan portfolio  including identification and review of individual problem situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  review of overall portfolio quality through an analysis of current charge offs  delinquency and nonperforming loan data  estimates of the value of any underlying collateral  an assessment of current and expected economic conditions and changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio 
other data utilized by management in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses includes  but is not limited to  the results of regulatory reviews  the amount of  trend of and or borrower characteristics on loans that are identified as requiring special attention as part of the credit review process  and peer group comparisons 
the impact of this other data might result in an allowance which will be greater than that indicated by the evaluation process previously described 
the allowance reflects management s evaluation both of loans presenting identified loss potential and of the risk inherent in various components of the portfolio  including loans identified as impaired as required by sfas no 
page thus  an increase in the size of the portfolio or in any of its components could necessitate an increase in the allowance even though there may not be a decline in credit quality or an increase in potential problem loans 
a significant change in any of the evaluation factors described above could result in future additions to the allowance 
at december   the ratio of the allowance to loans held in portfolio  net of unearned discounts  was and the allowance was million 
at such date  the company s nonaccrual loans amounted to million  million of such loans was judged to be impaired within the scope of sfas no 
nonaccrual loans and loans days past due and still accruing include leases  in the amount of million and million  respectively  of telecommunications equipment from a company that went into bankruptcy in july the service provider to the lessees discontinued service  resulting in the failure of certain lessees to make payments 
while pursuing collection of the lease payments  past due amounts accrue 
legal action is typically commenced against lessees whose accounts are not paid within days and are placed in nonaccrual status 
lessees remain unconditionally obligated to make payments 
all are creditworthy and personally guaranteed  the reported delinquencies are not due to credit issues 
based on the foregoing  as well as management s judgment as to the current risks inherent in loans held in portfolio  the company s allowance for loan losses was deemed adequate to absorb all reasonably anticipated losses on specifically known and other possible credit risks associated with the portfolio as of december  net losses within loans held in portfolio are not statistically predictable and changes in conditions in the next twelve months could result in future provisions for loan losses varying from the level taken in potential problem loans  which are loans that are currently performing under present loan repayment terms but where known information about possible credit problems of borrowers causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to continue to comply with the present repayment terms  aggregated million and million at december  and  respectively

page asset liability management the company s primary earnings source is its net interest income  therefore  the company devotes significant time and has invested in resources to assist in the management of interest rate risk and asset quality 
the company s net interest income is affected by changes in market interest rates  and by the level and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the company s objectives in its asset liability management are to utilize its capital effectively  to provide adequate liquidity and to enhance net interest income  without taking undue risks or subjecting the company unduly to interest rate fluctuations 
the company takes a coordinated approach to the management of its liquidity  capital and interest rate risk 
this risk management process is governed by policies and limits established by senior management which are reviewed and approved by the asset liability committee 
this committee  which is comprised of members of senior management  meets to review  among other things  economic conditions  interest rates  yield curve  cash flow projections  expected customer actions  liquidity levels  capital ratios and repricing characteristics of assets  liabilities and financial instruments 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market indices such as interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
the company s principal market risk exposure is interest rate risk  with no material impact on earnings from changes in foreign exchange rates or equity prices 
interest rate risk is the exposure to changes in market interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between market interest rates and net interest income due to the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
the company monitors the interest rate sensitivity of its balance sheet positions by examining its near term sensitivity and its longer term gap position 
in its management of interest rate risk  the company utilizes several financial and statistical tools including traditional gap analysis and sophisticated income simulation models 
a traditional gap analysis is prepared based on the maturity and repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for selected time bands 
the mismatch between repricings or maturities within a time band is commonly referred to as the gap for that period 
a positive gap asset sensitive where interest rate sensitive assets exceed interest rate sensitive liabilities generally will result in the net interest margin increasing in a rising rate environment and decreasing in a falling rate environment 
a negative gap liability sensitive will generally have the opposite result on the net interest margin 
however  the traditional gap analysis does not assess the relative sensitivity of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates and other factors that could have an impact on interest rate sensitivity or net interest income 
the company utilizes the gap analysis to complement its income simulations modeling  primarily focusing on the longer term structure of the balance sheet 
the company s balance sheet structure is primarily short term in nature with a substantial portion of assets and liabilities repricing or maturing within one year 
the company s gap analysis at december   presented on page  indicates that net interest income would increase during periods of rising interest rates and decrease during periods of falling interest rates  but  as mentioned above  gap analysis may not be an accurate predictor of net interest income 
as part of its interest rate risk strategy  the company may use financial instrument derivatives to hedge the interest rate sensitivity of assets 
the company has written policy guidelines  approved by the board of directors  governing the use of financial instruments  including approved counterparties  risk limits and appropriate internal control procedures 
the credit risk of derivatives arises principally from the potential for a counterparty to fail to meet its obligation to settle a contract on a timely basis 
during  the company did not enter into any derivative contracts to hedge its interest rate risk 
at december  and  the company was not a party to any derivative contracts to hedge its interest rate risk 
the company utilizes income simulation models to complement its traditional gap analysis 
while the asset liability committee routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon  it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the income simulation models measure the company s net interest income volatility or sensitivity to interest rate changes utilizing statistical techniques that allow the company to consider various factors which impact net interest income 
these factors include actual maturities  estimated cash flows  repricing page characteristics  deposits growth retention and  most importantly  the relative sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities to changes in market interest rates 
this relative sensitivity is important to consider as the company s core deposit base has not been subject to the same degree of interest rate sensitivity as its assets 
the core deposit costs are internally managed and tend to exhibit less sensitivity to changes in interest rates than the company s adjustable rate assets whose yields are based on external indices and generally change in concert with market interest rates 
the company s interest rate sensitivity is determined by identifying the probable impact of changes in market interest rates on the yields on the company s assets and the rates that would be paid on its liabilities 
this modeling technique involves a degree of estimation based on certain assumptions that management believes to be reasonable 
utilizing this process  management projects the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest margin 
the company has established certain policy limits for the potential volatility of its net interest margin assuming certain levels of changes in market interest rates with the objective of maintaining a stable net interest margin under various probable rate scenarios 
management generally has maintained a risk position well within the policy limits 
as of december   the model indicated the impact of a basis point parallel and pro rata rise in rates over months would approximate a million increase in net interest income  while the impact of a basis point decline in rates over the same period would approximate a million decline from an unchanged rate environment 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot provide any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to prepayment refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that the asset liability committee might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
the shape of the yield curve can cause downward pressure on net interest income 
in general  if and to the extent that the yield curve is flatter ie  the differences between interest rates for different maturities are relatively smaller than previously anticipated  then the yield on the company s interest earning assets and its cash flows will tend to be lower 
management believes that a relatively flat yield curve shape could adversely affect the company s results in liquidity risk liquidity is the ability to meet cash needs arising from changes in various categories of assets and liabilities 
liquidity is constantly monitored and managed at both the parent company and the bank levels 
liquid assets consist of cash and due from banks  interest bearing deposits in banks and federal funds sold and securities available for sale 
primary funding sources include core deposits  capital markets funds and other money market sources 
core deposits include domestic noninterest bearing and interest bearing retail deposits  which historically have been relatively stable 
the parent company and the bank believe that they have significant unused borrowing capacity 
contingency plans exist which we believe could be implemented on a timely basis to mitigate the impact of any dramatic change in market conditions 
while the parent company generates income from its own operations  it also depends for its cash requirements on funds maintained or generated by its subsidiaries  principally the bank 
such sources have been adequate to meet the parent company s cash requirements throughout its history 
various legal restrictions limit the extent to which the bank can supply funds to the parent company and its nonbank subsidiaries 
all national banks are limited in the payment of dividends without the approval of the comptroller of the currency to an amount not to exceed the net profits as defined  for the year to date combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years 
at december   the parent company s short term debt  consisting principally of commercial paper used to finance ongoing current business activities  was approximately million 
the parent company had cash  interest bearing deposits with banks and other current assets aggregating million 
the parent company also has back up credit lines with banks of million 
since  the parent company has had no need to use available back up lines of credit

capital the company and the bank are subject to risk based capital regulations which quantitatively measure capital against risk weighted assets  including certain off balance sheet items 
these regulations define the elements the tier and tier components of total capital and establish minimum ratios of for tier capital and for total capital for capital adequacy purposes 
supplementing these regulations is a leverage requirement 
this requirement establishes a minimum leverage ratio at least to  which is calculated by dividing tier capital by adjusted quarterly average assets after deducting goodwill 
information regarding the company s and the bank s risk based capital at december  and december   is presented in note beginning on page in addition  the bank is subject to the provisions of the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia which imposes a number of mandatory supervisory measures 
among other matters  fdicia established five capital categories ranging from well capitalized to critically under capitalized 
such classifications are used by regulatory agencies to determine a bank s deposit insurance premium  approval of applications authorizing institutions to increase their asset size or otherwise expand business activities or acquire other institutions 
under fdicia  a well capitalized bank must maintain minimum leverage  tier and total capital ratios of  and  respectively
