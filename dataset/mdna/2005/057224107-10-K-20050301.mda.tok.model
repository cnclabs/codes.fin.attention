item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
international operations we operate in over countries worldwide  and our operations are subject to the risks inherent in doing business in multiple countries with various laws and differing political environments 
these risks include  but are not limited to war  boycotts  political and economic changes  corruption  terrorism  expropriation  foreign currency exchange controls  taxes and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
although it is impossible to predict the likelihood of such occurrences or their effect on us  division and corporate management routinely evaluate these risks and take appropriate actions to mitigate the risks where possible 
however  there can be no assurance that an occurrence of any one or more of these events would not have a material adverse effect on our operations 
further information is contained in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
research and development  patents we are engaged in research and development activities directed primarily toward the improvement of existing products and services  the design of specialized products to meet specific customer needs and the development of new products  processes and services 
for information regarding the amounts of research and development expense in each of the three years in the period ended december   see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item herein 
we have followed a policy of seeking patent and trademark protection both inside and outside the united states for products and methods that appear to have commercial significance 
we believe our patents and trademarks to be adequate for the conduct of our business  and aggressively pursue protection of our patents against patent infringement worldwide 
while we regard patent and trademark protection as important to our business and future prospects  we consider our established reputation  the reliability and quality of our products and the technical skills of our personnel to be more important 
no single patent or trademark is considered to be of a critical nature to our business 

table of contents raw materials we purchase various raw materials and component parts for use in manufacturing our products 
the principal materials we purchase are steel alloys including chromium and nickel  titanium  beryllium  copper  tungsten carbide  synthetic and natural diamonds  printed circuit boards and other electronic components and hydrocarbon based chemical feed stocks 
all of these materials are available from numerous sources and could be subject to rising costs 
we have not experienced any significant shortages of these materials and normally do not carry inventories of such materials in excess of those reasonably required to meet our production schedules 
we do not expect any significant interruptions in supply  but there can be no assurance that there will be no price or supply issues over the long term 
other developments in october  we signed a definitive agreement for the sale of bird machine bird  the remaining division of the former process segment  and recorded charges totaling million  net of tax of million  which consisted of a loss of million on the write down of bird to fair value  million of severance and warranty accruals and a loss of million related to the recognition of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments into earnings 
in january  we completed the sale of bird and recorded an additional loss on the sale of million with no tax benefit 
we received million in proceeds  which were subject to post closing adjustments to the purchase price  and retained certain accounts receivable  inventories and other assets 
during the second quarter of  we made a net payment of million to the buyer in settlement of the final purchase price adjustments 
the adjustments were the result of changes in the value of assets sold to and liabilities assumed by the buyer between the date the initial sales price was negotiated and the closing of the sale

employees at december   we had approximately  employees  as compared with approximately  employees at december  approximately  of these employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements or similar type labor arrangements  of which the majority are outside the us based upon the geographic diversification of these employees  we believe any risk of loss from employee strikes or other collective actions would not be material to the conduct of our operations taken as a whole 
we believe that our relations with our employees are good

environmental matters we are committed to the health and safety of people  protection of the environment and compliance with laws  regulations and our policies 
our past and present operations include activities that are subject to domestic including us federal  state and local and international regulations with regard to air and water quality and other environmental matters 
we believe we are in substantial compliance with these regulations 
regulation in this area continues to evolve  and changes in standards of enforcement of existing regulations  as well as the enactment and enforcement of new legislation  may require us and our customers to modify  supplement or replace equipment or facilities or to change or discontinue present methods of operation 
we are involved in voluntary remediation projects at some of our present and former manufacturing facilities  the majority of which relate to properties obtained in acquisitions or to sites no longer actively used in operations 
on rare occasions  remediation activities are conducted as specified by a government agency issued consent decree or agreed order 
remediation costs are accrued based on estimates of probable exposure using currently available facts  existing environmental permits  technology and presently enacted laws and regulations 
for sites where we are primarily responsible for the remediation  our cost estimates are developed based on internal evaluations and are not discounted 
such accruals are recorded when it is probable that we will be obligated to pay amounts for environmental site evaluation  remediation or related activities  and such amounts can be reasonably estimated 
if the obligation can only be estimated within a range  we accrue the minimum amount in the range 
such accruals are recorded even if significant uncertainties exist over the ultimate cost of the remediation 
ongoing environmental compliance costs  such as obtaining environmental permits  installation of pollution control equipment and waste disposal  are expensed as incurred 
during the year ended december   we spent approximately million to comply with domestic and international standards regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment collectively  environmental regulations 
this cost includes the total spent on remediation projects at current or former sites  superfund projects and environmental compliance activities  exclusive of capital 
in  we expect to spend approximately million to comply with environmental regulations 
based upon current information  we believe that our compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position because we have either established adequate reserves or our cost for that compliance is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements 
during the year ended december   we incurred approximately million in capital expenditures for environmental control equipment  and we estimate we will incur approximately million during we believe these capital expenditures for environmental control equipment will not have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated financial statements because the aggregate amount of these expenditures is not expected to be material 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act known as superfund or cercla imposes liability for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
superfund liability is imposed without regard to fault and even if the waste disposal was in compliance with laws and regulations 
we have been identified as a potentially responsible party prp in remedial activities related to various superfund sites  and we accrue our share of the estimated remediation costs of the site based on the ratio of the estimated volume of waste we contributed to the site to the total volume of waste disposed at the site 
with the joint and several liability imposed under superfund  a prp may be required to pay more than its proportional share of such costs 
we have been identified as prps at various superfund sites discussed below 
the united states environmental protection agency the epa and appropriate state agencies supervise investigative and cleanup activities at these sites 
at december   we have accrued million of remediation costs related to the sites detailed below 
when used in the descriptions of the sites below  the word de minimis refers to the smallest prps  whose contribution rate is usually less than 

table of contents a baker petrolite  hughes christensen  an inteq predecessor entity  baker oil tools and a former subsidiary were named in april as prps at the sheridan superfund site located in hempstead  texas 
the texas commission on environmental quality tceq is overseeing the remedial work at this site 
the sheridan site trust was formed to manage the site remediation and we participate as a member 
based on the use of new remedial technologies  the cost projections for full remediation have been reduced from million to million  of which million has been collected 
our contribution is approximately of the estimated million in remaining costs 
b in december  one of our former subsidiaries was named a respondent in an epa administrative order for remedial design and remedial action associated with the middlefield ellis whisman study area  an eight square mile soil and groundwater contamination site located in mountain view  california 
as a result of the environmental investigations and a resulting report delivered to the epa in september  the epa has informed us that no further work needs to be performed on the site 
in fact  the epa has indicated that it does not believe there is a contaminant source on the property 
we signed a settlement agreement in march  which transferred any future liability for investigation and remediation at the site to the prp group 
the settlement amount was not material 
c in  we entered into a settlement agreement with prudential insurance company prudential regarding cost recovery for the san fernando valley glendale superfund 
one of our predecessors operated on the prudential property in glendale 
prudential was identified as a prp for the glendale superfund 
prudential instituted legal proceedings against us for cost recovery under cercla 
without any admission of liability  we agreed to pay of prudential s costs attributed to cleanup at the site  limited to a cap of million 
a pump and treat system was selected as the cleanup remedy at glendale  and it is expected to operate until we continue to contribute our portion of ongoing assessments to fund this remediation strategy 
d in june  the epa named a hughes christensen predecessor as a prp at the li tungsten site in glen cove  new york 
we contributed a de minimis amount of hazardous substances to the site 
in december  the epa issued us a special de minimis settlement offer based on the fact that our contribution was limited to metals contamination  not radiological contamination  at the site 
the settlement offer has been signed and is not material 
e in january  baker oil tools  baker petrolite and predecessor entities of baker petrolite were named as prps by the state of california s department of toxic substances control for the gibson site in bakersfield  california 
the cost estimate for remediation of the site is approximately million 
the combined volume that we contributed to the site is estimated to be less than for liquids and for solids 
f in  a hughes christensen predecessor  baker oil tools  inteq and one of our former subsidiaries were named as prps in the force road state superfund site located in brazoria county  texas 
the tceq is overseeing the investigation and remediation at the force road state site 
we participate as a member of the technical committee to effectively manage the project  since our contribution is estimated to be 
the initial investigation at the site is complete and a detailed report has been submitted to the tceq along with a proposed work plan 
the most current cost projections for closure of the site are in the range of million to million  however  this projection may change once the remedial options are fully evaluated 
g in  baker petrolite predecessors  hughes christensen predecessors and two of our former subsidiaries were identified as prps for the malone site located on campbell bayou road in texas city  texas 
the epa oversees the investigation and remediation of the malone site 
the epa has engaged in some emergency removal actions at the site 
the investigation is underway and when complete  remedial options will be developed and submitted to the epa for evaluation 
the initial estimate for cleanup at the malone site is million  however  this is subject to change since the final remedial plan has not been selected 
our total contribution is estimated at approximately 
h in january  western atlas international  inc  its predecessor companies and baker hughes oilfield operations  inc were identified as prps in the gulf nuclear superfund site in odessa  texas 
the epa conducted an emergency removal at the site in total investigation and cleanup costs are estimated by the epa to be approximately million 
a preliminary settlement proposal has been issued for review  and our settlement cost is not expected to be material 
i in september  we were identified as a de minimis prp by the epa for the operating industries  inc superfund site in monterrey park  california 
a settlement offer to all de minimis parties was delayed  but is expected in the epa and steering committee estimate cleanup costs in excess of million 
as of january  there was insufficient information to estimate our potential contribution to these cleanup costs 

table of contents j in october  baker petrolite was notified by the epa of their potential involvement at the cooper drum superfund site located in south gate  california 
at this time there is no estimate available for cleanup costs and  accordingly  there is insufficient information to estimate our potential contribution 
k in april  we were notified that baker petrolite was included in the container recycling superfund site in kansas city  kansas 
we are a major prp at the site  which was a former drum recycler used by a predecessor company to baker petrolite 
the epa estimates outstanding remedial costs of million  with our contribution estimated to be to of these costs 
in addition to the sites mentioned above  there are four superfund sites where we have ongoing obligations 
the remedial work at most of these sites has been completed and remaining operations are limited to groundwater recovery and or monitoring 
the monitoring phase can continue for up to years 
our aggregate cost for these sites is estimated to be less than million over this period of time 
while prps in superfund actions have joint and several liability for all costs of remediation  it is not possible at this time to quantify our ultimate exposure because some of the projects are either in the investigative or early remediation stage 
based upon current information  we do not believe that probable or reasonably possible expenditures in connection with the sites described above are likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements because we have established adequate reserves to cover the estimate we presently believe will be our ultimate liability with respect to the matter 
further  other prps involved in the sites have substantial assets and may reasonably be expected to pay their share of the cost of remediation  and  in some circumstances  we have insurance coverage or contractual indemnities from third parties to cover the ultimate liability 
we are subject to various other governmental proceedings and regulations  including foreign regulations  relating to environmental matters  but we do not believe that any of these matters is likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item herein for further discussion of environmental matters 
environmental matters contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the exchange act each a forward looking statement 
the words will  believe  to be  expect  estimate and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
our expectations regarding our compliance with environmental regulations and our expenditures to comply with environmental regulations  including without limitation our capital expenditures for environmental control equipment  are only our forecasts regarding these matters 
these forecasts may be substantially different from actual results  which may be affected by the following factors changes in environmental regulations  a material change in our allocation or other unexpected  adverse outcomes with respect to sites where we have been named as a prp  including without limitation the superfund sites described above  the discovery of new sites of which we are not aware and where additional expenditures may be required to comply with environmental regulations  an unexpected discharge of hazardous materials in the course of our business or operations  a catastrophic event causing discharges into the environment  or an acquisition of one or more new businesses

we insure against these risks to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the extent insurance is available  but no assurance can be given that the nature and amount of that insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities arising out of pending and future legal proceedings 
many of these insurance policies contain deductibles or self insured retentions in amounts we deem prudent and for which we are responsible for payment 
in determining the amount of self insurance  it is our policy to self insure those losses that are predictable  measurable and recurring in nature  such as claims for automobile liability  general liability and workers compensation 
we record accruals for the uninsured portion of losses related to these types of claims 
the accruals for losses are calculated by estimating losses for claims using historical claim data  specific loss development factors and other information as necessary
