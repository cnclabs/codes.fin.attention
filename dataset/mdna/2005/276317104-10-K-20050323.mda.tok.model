item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary net sales for increased to million from million for net income grew to million  or per diluted share  million  or 
per diluted share 
higher sales volume allowed for better from utilization of our manufacturing facilities  which resulted in increased profitability 
the improved profitability more than offset the start up costs associated with our new facility in shanghai  china  increased raw material prices  and the increased legal and settlement costs related to an alleged patent infringement suit 
net sales in the fourth quarter of increased to million from million a year earlier 
net income for the quarter increased to million or 
per diluted share from  or 
per diluted share a year earlier 
the net income benefited not only from the increased sales volume but also from the absence of certain costs that had affected the fourth quarter results 
those costs included expenses related to the closing of the company s florida location  legal fees associated with the alleged patent infringement suit  and expenses incurred to launch the searchalerttm product 
gross margin for the fourth quarter of was of net sales as compared to for the fourth quarter of product mix plus start up costs and charges associated with the shanghai operation accounted for the decrease 
selling and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of totaled million  comparable to the level 
increases resulting from the addition of the shanghai facility were offset by reductions at other locations  and also by the absence of the legal costs incurred in as a result of the alleged patent infringement suit 
the company s research into establishing a manufacturing facility in shanghai began in early the new factory  eastern industrial  ltd 
eis  which the company opened in late december  began full scale production in the second quarter of the company experienced cost increases in that affected the majority of material it uses in production such as steel  zinc and brass 
cost increases ranged from to 
the impact of the higher costs amounted to million  net of tax  or per diluted share 
the company has passed these increases in costs on to its customers where possible 
currently  there is no indication that the company will not be able to obtain all the materials it requires 
additionally  there are signs that prices for materials have leveled off or may actually decrease slightly in the company incurred legal expenses of  in to defend against a patent infringement suit that it had determined to be without merit 
the company incurred additional expense of  in the second quarter of as the result of a mediated settlement 
the legal expenses combined with the settlement resulted in charges to earnings net of taxes of  or per diluted share  in for and future years  the company anticipates increased costs related to the required compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
in addition  compliance will require a significant amount of time from company employees and higher audit fees for attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm

in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which was revised in december fin no 
r 
this rule requires that companies consolidate a variable interest entity if the company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities and or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns 
the provisions of fin no 
r were required to be applied as of the end of the first reporting period after march  for the variable interest entities in which a company holds a variable interest that it acquired on or before january  the adoption of fin no 
r did not have any impact on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter the amendments made by sfas no 
clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and require the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the guidance is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  it is not believed that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on the consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
sfas no 
r will require that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
sfas no 
r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans 
sfas no 
r replaces fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
 as originally issued in  established as preferable a fair value based method of accounting for share based payment transactions with employees 
however  that statement permitted entities the option of continuing to apply the guidance in apb opinion no 
 as long as the footnotes to financial statements disclosed what net income would have been had the preferable fair value based method been used 
public entities will be required to apply sfas no 
r as of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  the impact of the adoption of statement no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had the company adopted statement no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income loss and net income loss per share in the stock based compensation accounting policy note included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
areas of uncertainty that require judgments  estimates and assumptions include the accounting for derivatives  environmental matters  the testing of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment  proceeds on assets to be sold  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and tax matters 
management uses historical experience and all available information to make its estimates and assumptions  but actual results will inevitably differ from the estimates and assumptions that are used to prepare the company s financial statements at any given time 
despite these inherent limitations  management believes that management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the financial statements and related footnotes provide a meaningful and fair presentation of the company 
management believes that the application of these estimates and assumptions on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company s operating results and financial condition 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company reviews the collectibility of its receivables on an ongoing basis taking into account a combination of factors 
the company reviews potential problems  such as past due accounts  a bankruptcy filing or deterioration in the customer s financial condition  to ensure the company is adequately accrued for potential loss 
accounts are considered past due based on when payment was originally due 
if a customer s situation changes  such as a bankruptcy or creditworthiness  or there is a change in the current economic climate  the company may modify its estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company will write off accounts receivable after reasonable collection efforts have been made and the accounts are deemed uncollectible 
inventory reserve inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the last in  first out lifo method at the company s us facilities 
accordingly  a lifo valuation reserve is calculated using the dollar value link chain method 
we review the net realizable value of inventory in detail on an ongoing basis  giving consideration to deterioration  obsolescence and other factors 
based on these assessments  we provide for an inventory reserve in the period in which an impairment is identified 
the reserve fluctuates with market conditions  design cycles and other economic factors 
goodwill and intangibles intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized generally on a straight line basis over the periods benefited 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized 
each year during the second quarter  the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is tested for impairment 
the company uses the discounted cash flow method to calculate the fair value of goodwill associated with its reporting units  no impairments of goodwill were deemed to exist 
the determination of discounted cash flows is based on the businesses strategic plans and long range planning forecasts 
the revenue growth rates included in the plans are management s best estimates based on current and forecasted market conditions  profit margin assumptions are projected by each business based on the current cost structures and anticipated cost reductions 
there can be no assurance that operations will achieve the future cash flows reflected in the projections 
if different assumptions were used in these plans  the related discounted cash flows used in measuring impairment could be different and an impairment of assets might need to be recorded 
pension and other postretirement benefits the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are assumptions about such factors as expected return on plan assets  discount rates at which liabilities could be settled  rate of increase in future compensation levels  mortality rates and trends in health insurance costs 
these assumptions are reviewed annually and updated as required 
in accordance with gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect the expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 
the discount rate used is based on comparisons to the moody s aa bond index that creates a reference portfolio of high quality corporate bonds whose payments mimic the plan s benefit payment stream 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is developed with input from the company s actuarial firms 
also considered is the company s historical experience with pension fund asset performance in comparison with expected returns 
the long term rate of return assumption used for determining net periodic pension expense for was 
the company reviews the long term rate of return each year 
future actual pension income and expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population of participants in the company s pension plans 
the company expects to make cash contributions to its pension plans of approximately million for results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal the following table shows  for and  selected line items from the consolidated statements of income as a percentage of net sales  by segment

gross profit increased million  or  from due to higher sales volume and higher gross margin percentage 
in the security products segment  sales were higher than in the increase in volume of existing products was the result of sales of high security locks for access doors  electronics equipment and vehicular applications  which were up from levels  mainly through taking market share from our competition 
however  some of the sales increases were offset by slight declines in the sales of locks to the furniture  coin operated vending and gaming equipment markets and to lock distributors servicing lower volume accounts 
sales to the industrial controls and accessories market decreased 
sales of luggage locks for the travel industry increased in  following the introduction of our searchalerttm travel lock in late sales to this market had been hard hit in the wake of the september   terrorist attacks 
sales were additionally impacted by a transportation security administration tsa declaration that passengers should not lock their checked baggage on commercial airline flights 
responding to the tsa declaration  the ccl security products division introduced the searchalerttm  a new lock which meets all the requirements established by travel sentrytm  the standard setting group created to work closely with the tsa and the luggage lock manufacturers 
searchalerttm allows the tsa to unlock and inspect an airline passenger s bags without destroying the lock 
the product also lets the bags owner know  via an access indicator  if the bag has been opened 
sales of security products to the commercial laundry industry decreased from sales to this industry were down in most of our product lines and in all of the markets we service 
we are continuing our r d efforts and our search for smart card applications beyond the commercial laundry market 
we believe that the security characteristics of smart cards present us with several potential opportunities in new markets  which we are actively exploring 
new product introductions increased total segment sales by 
the new products included the searchalerttm  a snap in lock and a toolbox push button lock 
the security products segment gross margin was for both and gross profit increased  or  from  primarily due to the increase in sales 
in the metal products segment  sales were down from the previous year 
sales of contract castings were down from the primary cause of the decrease in contract castings was the decision of two large accounts to move their remaining casting business to lower cost  offshore sources 
however  that decision itself resulted from our implementation of a new strategy begun in and completed in to focus on mine roof anchor systems 
sales of mine roof support anchors decreased from  mainly because one account chose to place some key business with a lower cost  offshore supplier 
the bulk of the reduction in sales involved the proprietary product that we had produced under contract for that customer until mid the loss of this business was partially offset by a increase in sales to our second largest us mining account 
the us coal mining industry grew through and the rate of growth into is over 
with rising oil prices  coal has been growing in importance as an energy source worldwide 
the growth in coal consumption should provide new opportunities for mine roof anchor sales both in north america and asia 
to expand our markets and counter the lower demand in the us for mine roof fasteners  resulting from changes in mining methods utilizing fewer roof anchors per ton of coal produced  during we entered into a technical agreement with the china university of mining and technology for the field testing and eventual marketing of the company s mechanical anchor systems  which are used to secure the roofs in underground mines 
these tests have been substantially and successfully completed 
we will now begin our marketing strategy to penetrate the mining market in china 
in addition  to offset reduced demand for malleable iron castings  we have continued to develop our ductile iron casting capability 
shipments of ductile iron castings grew to tons in while that accounts for only of total sales in  there is significant opportunity for growth in gross margin for the metal products segment was for as compared to for gross profit for decreased  or  from  primarily due to lower sales volume and the fixed costs associated with the business

in the security products segment  operating profit was for as compared to for operating income decreased  or from the decrease was primarily due to higher legal and settlement costs associated with the aforementioned patent lawsuit  and higher raw material costs 
these higher costs were partially offset by increased sales volume in and by one time charges in relating to the closing of the company s florida location and the launch of the searchalerttm product 
the metal products segment recorded a operating loss of  or of sales  as compared to a loss of  or  in the erosion in operating profit was primarily the result of fixed costs relating to the operation of the foundry and the reduction in sales 
interest expense for the company decreased  or  from due to lower outstanding debt balances 
other income decreased  or  from the decrease primarily reflected a gain in on the sale of common stock  and a drop in the interest income the company received during the gain in totaled  and was from the sale of common stock received during from a single issuer in connection with the issuer s demutualization

the industrial hardware segment experienced a increase in sales 
the increase in volume of existing products is the result of an increase in sales of heavy hardware sold to the tractor trailer industry of from levels 
sales to this market had been down since the latter half of this market is expected to grow throughout and into as the economy continues to expand 
the rebound in the tractor trailer market utilizing heavy hardware could be adversely affected by higher steel prices and diminishing allocation of raw materials 
sales of industrial hardware such as rotary locks  locking recessed handles  multi point paddle handles and slam latches to original equipment manufacturers increased in this increase was due to orders from new customers and higher demand for truck service bodies 
however  sales to distributors were down from  primarily because of continued softness in this sector of our business 
sales of school bus door closures increased in  reflecting a greater volume of business with our primary bus hardware customer 
sales of automotive accessories toolbox locks  push button locks and rotary latches declined as a result of domestic and offshore competition in this market 
sales at the company s mexican operation decreased from primarily due to a lack of economic growth in mexico 
new product sale increases were the result of internally developed new products for the utility truck and vehicular accessory markets  which increased sales by  while sales of sleeper boxes for the class trailer truck market  resulting from the canadian commercial vehicles acquisition  increased sales by 
despite the sluggishness of the economy  the company continued to invest in new products and search for business acquisitions that complement its existing operations or provide opportunities to enter new markets 
the industrial hardware segment gross margin was for as compared to of sales for the decrease in the gross margin percentage is the result of a greater number of lower margin products being sold as the result of the inclusion of the canadian commercial vehicle acquisition for the full year of this company sells sleeper boxes for the class truck market which are sold at a much lower profit margin than our traditional transportation and industrial products 
in addition  higher material  labor and benefit costs further reduced margins since the company was unable to pass price increases along to our customers 
in the security products segment  sales were higher than in the increase in volume of existing products was the result of sales of high security locks for coin operated vending and gaming equipment being up in that increase was primarily the result of our gaining market share from our competition in an otherwise flat market 
sales of locks for access doors  furniture  electronics equipment and vehicular applications were up from levels  mainly through taking market share from our competition 
however  some of the sales increases were offset by slight declines in sales of locks to the computer industry and to lock distributors servicing lower volume accounts and sales to the industrial controls and accessories market decreased 
sales of luggage locks for the travel industry declined

the company expects this lock to have a significant effect on luggage lock sales in sales of security products to the commercial laundry industry increased from sales of smart card products increased in  partially offsetting declines that occurred in sales of two of the company s mature products for the laundry sector 
the growth in smart card product sales continues to be driven by greater acceptance of the technology among both existing and new customers 
new product introductions increased sales by which included presto seals  remote keyless entry systems and searchalerttm 
the security products segment gross margin was for as compared to of sales for the gross profit increased  or  from primarily due to the aforementioned increase in sales of 
in the metal products segment  total sales were down from the previous year 
while the sale of the company s proprietary mine roof anchor systems decreased slightly compared to  sales of contract castings were down from this decrease was caused mainly by the company s decision to focus its efforts more intensively on its mine roof anchor systems 
because of lower labor and operating costs in countries such as china  mexico and germany  and in some cases favorable monetary exchange rates  the price of imported castings is often well below that of us produced castings 
however  the company will continue to offer contract castings to customers when profit margins are acceptable 
the slight decrease in the sales of mine roof anchors reflected lower demand for these products partly as a result of fairly stable weather conditions which reduces the demand for power which in turn reduces the demand for coal 
in addition  the increased use of mining techniques such as strip and long well mining require none or fewer roof anchor supports than underground mining 
the new energy information administration eia projects that coal will increase its share of us electricity generation from in to by the national energy policy legislation currently before congress aims at providing affordable coal based electricity to business and consumers and at providing additional incentives for the deployment of clean coal technologies 
the eia s annual energy outlook increased its projection by to gigawatts of new coal fired generating capacity plants will be deployed over the next years 
management continues to believe that coal will remain the backbone of the us energy supply 
total coal production in is projected to increase from although the demand for coal is influenced by the weather  the rising price of natural gas  advances in hydrogen technology and the growing need for fuel diversity have positioned coal usage for growth 
in order to maintain utilization rates in its manufacturing plant  the company has been developing capabilities for producing castings using ductile iron previously  it used only malleable iron in its casting products 
while the company has filled several small orders  the company is still refining and perfecting its ductile iron capabilities 
although the new capabilities will enable the company to supply additional products and services to its customers  further capital investments may be required to make the casting of larger quantities possible 
the metal products segment gross margin was for as compared to of sales for gross profit decreased  or  from primarily due to the aforementioned decrease in sales from the total company gross margin percentage for was percentage point below the level versus 
the decrease was the result of increased costs for group health insurance  property and liability insurance and pensions

the most significant recurring non cash items included in income are depreciation and amortization expense 
changes in working capital fluctuate with the changes in operating activities 
as sales increase  there generally is an increased requirement for working capital 
since increases in working capital reduce the company s cash  management attempts to keep the company s investment in net working capital at a reasonable level by closely monitoring inventory levels by matching production to expected market demand  keeping tight control over the collection of receivables  and optimizing payment terms on its trade and other payables 
the company is dependent on the continued demand for its products and subsequent collection of accounts receivable from its customers 
the company serves a broad base of customers and industries with a variety of products 
as a result  any fluctuations in demand or payment from a particular industry or customer will not have a material impact on the company s sales and collection of receivables

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s foreign manufacturing facilities account for approximately of total sales and of total assets 
its us operations buy from and sell to these foreign affiliates  and also make limited sales approximately of total sales to nonaffiliated foreign customers 
this trade activity could be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange or by weak economic conditions 
the company s currency exposure is concentrated in the canadian dollar  mexican peso  new taiwan dollar  chinese rmb and hong kong dollar 
because of the company s limited exposure to any single foreign market  any exchange gains or losses have not been material and are not expected to be material in the future 
had the exchange rate as of january  for all of the listed currencies changed by  the total change in reported earnings would have been less than  as a result  the company does not attempt to mitigate its foreign currency exposure through the acquisition of any speculative or leveraged financial instruments 
in  a increase decrease in exchange rates would have resulted in a translation increase decrease to sales of approximately million  and to equity of approximately million 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk with respect to its unsecured loan agreement  which provides for interest based on libor plus a spread of up to 
the spread is determined by a comparison of the company s operating performance with agreed upon financial targets 
since the company s performance depends to a large extent on the overall economy  the interest rate paid by the company under its loan agreement is closely linked to the trend in the us economy 
the current interest rate spread is on the term loan portion and on the revolving credit line portion of the loan agreement 
changes in libor rates will also affect the company s interest expense 
to hedge against future libor rate increases  the company has a swap contract on a portion of the term loan under the loan agreement 
the interest rate on the swap contract is and the swap contract expires on july  the notional amount of the swap contract is reduced on a quarterly basis in accordance with the principal repayment schedule for the term portion of the loan agreement 
the notional amount of the swap contract was million as of january  the remainder of the term debt is subject to the volatility of short term interest rates  where a change in interest rates would cause an  increase or decrease in the company s annual interest cost 
while the company could enter into an additional swap agreement to fix the rate  it does not expect to do so
