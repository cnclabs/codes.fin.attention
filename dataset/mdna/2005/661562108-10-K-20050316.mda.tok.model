overview we are a telecommunications company with annual revenues for of  our original core business  which dates back to  consisted primarily of providing telecommunications services in our ilec territory  which today covers approximately square miles and is located north of the city of pittsburgh 
in  as the internet was still in its relatively early stages  we purchased a small isp as a segue into that market 
during  we began to expand our business beyond our ilec territory via a clec edge out strategy 
in addition  from through  we invested approximately million in our ilec territory to upgrade the majority of our network and to deploy a csa architecture in order to allow us to offer advanced broadband products 
today  the investments that we have made to develop our internet related products  to expand our business via our edge out strategy and to modernize our network for advanced broadband products have provided the majority of our revenue growth 
the great majority of our revenues are generated based on monthly recurring services and are therefore not subject to large short term fluctuations 
in addition to our core businesses described above  we also derive a portion of our net income and cash flow from our limited partner interests in three wireless partnerships  all of which are majority owned and operated by verizon wireless 
these partnerships  which have their origin in the s with the allocation by the fcc of b licenses  cover territories which overlap the majority of our ilec and edge out markets 
industry dynamics demand for the traditional voice telecommunications business has been negatively impacted by the proliferation of wireless services led by one rate bundled pricing plans that include large if not unlimited buckets of minutes  the popularity of alternative communication technologies such as email and instant messaging and by technological advances such as cable modems and dsl that obviate the need for secondary  and in some cases primary  access lines 
in addition  the telecommunications industry has experienced a very difficult period of contraction brought on by over investments in the late s that have created excess capacity in certain markets 
as a result  the industry has experienced a relatively high number of major bankruptcies over the past several years 
besides the negative financial ramifications of absorbing write offs of pre petition amounts owed from such carriers  we are now faced with many of these companies re emerging from bankruptcy with restructured balance sheets and greater financial flexibility 
broadband growth has been a bright spot in the overall industry during the past several years 
however  the broadband market is very competitive  with little differentiation to the end user customer between products offered by telephone and cable companies 
as such  pricing has been the main focus in winning new customers and retaining existing customers 
although the costs to deliver broadband technologies have decreased over the past several years  margins have continued to be squeezed by pricing decreases to customers 

table of contents the proliferation of broadband access has also resulted in new threats from innovative technologies  such as voip  that threaten to further decrease the revenues received from the traditional voice business 
besides potentially displacing the need for a secondary or primary line  the potential regulatory definition and classification of voip services which takes on many forms may have a significant impact on the current access compensation structure 
regulation and competition the telecommunications industry was greatly impacted by the passage of the act  which was the legislative instrument that opened the industry to significantly greater competition 
the degree and pace at which markets have been experiencing competition have varied  with most of the original regulatory barriers to entry removed in the markets served by the country s largest local exchange carriers  also referred to as the regional bell operating companies rbocs 
smaller rural companies  such as our ilec  north pittsburgh  were given regulatory relief in the form of exemptions and temporary suspensions from many of the competitive portions of the act in order to allow state regulators sufficient time to examine the public policy implications of allowing competition in rural areas  and if deemed in the public interest  to allow smaller companies to gradually prepare for competition and to restructure rates 
although we still maintain in our ilec territory some of the regulatory protections against non facilities based competition  we expect that over time these protections will be reduced or entirely eliminated 
while the act has placed a higher degree of uncertainty on our future revenue streams and margins in our ilec territory  it has given us the opportunity to selectively expand outside of that territory by taking advantage of the pro competitive aspects of the act 
we have pursued an edge out strategy into pittsburgh and its surrounding communities as well as into the city of butler and its surrounding areas  leveraging the network  human capital skills and solid reputation of our traditional ilec business 
the act primarily deals with regulations concerning intra modal competition that is  competition among traditional wireline companies 
at the same time  however  we have begun to experience a great deal of inter modal competition  from wireless carriers and cable companies 
we view these facilities based competitors to be the most formidable  as these companies can totally bypass our existing networks 
highlights and outlook revenues for increased  or  over the majority of this growth was attributable to our ability to continue to effectively penetrate our edge out markets as well as expand our broadband service offerings 
the revenue growth rate of  though  was lower than the revenue growth rate of  due mostly to several intercarrier compensation rate decreases 
a revision in the percent local use plu factor used to settle traffic between verizon and penn telecom in september of  the continued phase down of penn telecom s interstate access rates in conjunction with the fcc s access charge reform order and decreases in access and transit rates charged for wireless traffic have been the main contributing factors to the curtailment of the revenue growth rate 
in addition  the rate of increase in revenues from one of our fastest growing products in  pri circuits provisioned to isps in our edge out markets  diminished in growth in revenues in as compared to a increase in due to the general deterioration in the dial up market and consolidation among our isp customers which has led to the elimination of redundant facilities 
finally  revenues recorded from the national exchange carrier association neca interstate pooling arrangements in which the company s north pittsburgh subsidiary participates were slightly down for  reversing the trend of increases in such revenues experienced over the past several years 
changes in neca average schedule formulas used to determine the company s interstate revenue requirement as well as some regulatory modifications and other events which have diminished the company s ability to earn above the historical allowable rate of return have caused these revenues to decrease slightly 
for  we expect our revenue growth rate to be more comparable to that rate experienced in than to the historically higher growth rates experienced in through as outlined in the selected financial data 
table of contents section of item to this form k 
several of the items mentioned above also will have continuing impacts on the revenue growth rate 
in addition  we expect that competition for all of our service offerings will continue to intensify  resulting in further pressures on operating revenues and margins 
we expect that revenue growth will continue to be driven by the addition of new customers in our edge out markets and by further broadband penetration 
we have also started to focus to an even greater extent on bundled product offerings  which we anticipate will drive value to our customers and serve as a tool for retention of our existing customer base 
total operating expenses for decreased  from the prior year period  which included  in charges associated with a workforce reduction program 
excluding those charges  other operating expenses increased  or  in the increase in operating expenses was predominately due to increases in the direct costs associated with the growth in access lines and access line equivalents  such as fees paid for leasing unbundled network elements in the portions of our edge out markets that we do not wholly provision over our own facilities and fees paid to terminate the increased local  toll and internet traffic generated by our growing customer base 
the increase in operating expenses  though  was lower than experienced in the past several years due to the positive impacts of a decrease in the cost of contracted operational support system oss services pursuant to a new agreement executed in the third quarter of  a decrease in depreciation expense as a result of the capitalized costs and license fees incurred for our oss becoming fully depreciated and by our ability to greatly moderate the annual growth rate in overall labor costs inclusive of current and postretirement benefits 
labor costs increased at an approximate rate for  in contrast to double digit percentage increases in these costs experienced in the past several years 
labor costs were positively impacted by the workforce reduction at the company s north pittsburgh subsidiary as well as by the ability to keep postretirement benefit expenses exclusive of the  in one time curtailment charges incurred in in association with the aforementioned workforce reduction relatively flat on a year over year basis  reversing the trend of double digit percentage increases experienced in the past several years 
the increase in aggregate labor costs was mostly the result of an increase in medical insurance premiums 
for  we expect our operating costs to increase at a slightly greater rate than experienced during the positive year over year benefits of the decreases in depreciation expense and cost of contracted oss services experienced in were mostly the result of including the higher depreciation and oss costs  respectively 
for comparative purposes  both years will include the benefits of the reduced costs 
in addition  during  we expect to implement several new software systems  including a workforce management system  an automated switch provisioning system and a new billing and oss platform at our clec 
we believe that these systems will improve our cost structure and operational efficiencies over the long term 
however  it is typical that the implementation costs for such projects exceed the cost savings in the first year 
in addition  we anticipate rolling out our new voip product in again  although we expect that this new product will enhance our ability to compete in both the residential and business customer segments as well as  over time  serve as a lower cost platform for many elements of our network  the costs associated in the first year will likely exceed the first year benefits 
with respect to our operating costs in our edge out clec markets  we continue to monitor the developments in the fcc s triennial review order tro 
based on our interpretation of the most recent authoritative guidelines the fcc s order on remand released on february   we do not believe that the order will have a material impact on our cost structure 
currently  we provision only of our clec access lines which represents only of our consolidated access lines utilizing unbundled network element platform une p loops 
although costs for une p loops will increase over time  our relatively low use of une p and the ability to migrate some of the lines to alternative provisioning methodologies will limit the overall impact 
based on our interpretation of the rules concerning access to unbundled high capacity loops  interoffice transport facilities and dark fiber  we believe we will experience moderate increases in the overall cost to provision such loops and facilities during however  we caution that although the fcc s order defines impairment of such circuits based on a review of the number of business lines and fiber based collocators in a serving wiring center  the practical definitions of what constitutes a business line or fiber based collocator have yet to be decided 
in a separate matter  the pa puc has recently revised many of verizon s unbundled rates for loops as well as high 
table of contents capacity circuits 
although the revised rates reflect a mixture of both increases and decreases  based on the specific types of circuits and markets in which we operate  we should experience in an overall slight decrease in the average costs to provision our clec access lines 
we caution  however  that verizon has challenged the pa puc s revisions of these verizon rates in federal court 
our cost structure is heavily weighted towards labor and depreciation 
as such  there is not a great deal of direct correlation between our revenues and our largest operating expenses 
as previously noted  we have taken steps to address our overall labor costs  including the workforce reduction program implemented in and using our excess cash reserves to make additional contributions into the defined benefit pension plan 
the benefits of taking these steps were evident in the results of operations for  as we were able to contain the growth in overall labor costs to in in addition  pursuant to a renegotiated collective bargaining agreement in covering our north pittsburgh subsidiary  we have restricted future hires from being eligible to participate in the north pittsburgh defined benefit pension plan 
although we will not see any immediate benefits from this in and estimate only modest benefits in the next few years thereafter  the long term impact should be to greatly reduce postretirement benefit expenses which currently exceed  per year 
we also have implemented a targeted capital expenditure program  in which the majority of our expenditures are directly related to new customer additions 
the significant network modernization investments which we made from through have enabled us to keep our maintenance capital expenditures defined as capital expenditures needed to continually replace and or expand our network capabilities to address our existing customer base at levels of of revenues over the last several years  which is much lower than the industry average of over 
maintaining our existing operating margins going forward will be challenging as competition intensifies and lower margin services  such as dsl and clec access lines  generate a larger percentage of our overall revenues 
nevertheless  we will continue to manage our cost structure and capital spending aggressively 
in addition  we have benefited from investments made in the last two decades in wireless partnerships  all of which today are majority owned and operated by verizon wireless 
instead of deploying the majority of our capital into forming and operating our own wireless business  which would from a scale perspective be at a tremendous disadvantage in a market in which our competition would be national carriers with billions of dollars in capital resources  we alternatively invested in three wireless partnerships covering pittsburgh and other portions of western pennsylvania 
total equity income recorded from our investments in the wireless partnerships increased  in our financial condition and balance sheet have continually improved over the last several years through prudent investment strategies and strong cash flows generated from operating activities 
unlike many telecommunication companies that have substantially leveraged their businesses  we have a greater amount of cash and temporary investments on hand  than our total debt outstanding 
our financial condition gives us the ability to invest in new products and or opportunities and the flexibility to continue to evaluate ways to create greater shareholder value  whether through our dividend policy  stock repurchases or other investment opportunities 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto  included in this annual report 
results of operations vs 
net income for was  or per share  compared to net income of  or 
per share  for the increase in net income was attributable to the following factors operating revenues total operating revenues increased  or  during this increase was the result of increases in local network services revenues of   directory advertising  billing and other services revenues of 
table of contents and other operating revenues of   offset partially by decreases in long distance and access services revenues of and telecommunication equipment sales of 
increases in local network services revenues of  or  were primarily attributable to the following factors local dial tone revenues increased  partially as a result of total access lines including clec growing by  lines  or  from  access lines as of december  to  access lines as of december  more specifically  the total growth was a result of a  access line increase in our edge out markets offset partially by a  access line decrease in our ilec market 
also contributing to the increase was an approximate  increase in local dial tone revenues due to revenue neutral rate re balancings at north pittsburgh during april and december of  which increased local residential rates and decreased intrastate access rates 
revenues earned from pris increased  mostly as a result of a increase in the average number of circuits in our edge out markets during the course of however  the increase in the average number of circuits was more heavily weighted to the first half of in comparison to the first half of as of december   our pri circuit count was approximately lower than it was as of december   primarily due to the consolidation of our isp customer base  which led to an elimination of redundant facilities 
as communicated in our form k  we expected our pri revenue growth rate to decrease from previous rates annual increase in 
the majority of our pri circuits sold in our edge out markets were the result of winning isps away from the incumbent 
isps use pris as a component of their network for dial up traffic 
the continued penetration of broadband services has led to customers migrating from dial up connections to broadband access  thereby decreasing the overall market s need for dial up infrastructure 
the western pennsylvania market is also experiencing consolidation in the dial up business  and we have recently experienced consolidation among our customers which has led to the elimination of redundant facilities 
although we may continue to win isp business from the incumbents  we already have a relatively high penetration rate in the isp markets in which we currently operate 
that fact  along with the general deterioration in the overall isp market  will most likely result in a decline over time in our revenues received from pris sold to the isps 
vertical feature revenues which include revenues from custom calling features such as voicemail  caller id  call waiting  etc 
increased during  mostly as a result of the growth in access lines and the up selling of these features in bundled packages 
the growth rate in such revenues experienced in was lower than the increase in such revenues experienced in due mostly to the fact that average revenue received per vertical feature continues to decline as these features are often discounted in the bundled packages 
local reciprocal compensation revenues increased during in association with the growth in terminating traffic generated by the above mentioned increase in access lines 
in addition  we benefited from being able to bill for traffic above the growth cap set in the original fcc order on intercarrier compensation for isp bound traffic pursuant to the forbearance granted by the fcc in october of in the petition of core communications  inc we expect local reciprocal compensation revenues to increase in at a rate higher than that experienced in because included only approximately two and one half months of the benefit associated with being able to bill for traffic above the original growth cap 
this expectation assumes no further changes to the rules regarding intercarrier compensation for isp bound traffic during the increase in directory advertising  billing and other services revenues of was mostly attributable to the first quarter including an approximate reduction in revenues recorded in anticipation of a lower settlement for the directory book than originally estimated 
the positive increase in directory advertising revenues was partially offset by a decrease in carrier billing and collection revenues as the volumes of services and calls billed on behalf of other carriers have continued to decrease 

table of contents the increase in other operating revenues of  or  was primarily due to growth in dsl revenues of approximately  as combined dsl lines both wholesale and retail sold increased from  as of december  to  as of december  the decrease in long distance and access services revenues of  or  was primarily attributable to the following factors access revenues decreased  primarily due to four factors 
first  as previously described in the text above that discusses local network services revenues  there was an approximate  reduction in north pittsburgh s intrastate access revenues in conjunction with the revenue neutral rate re balancings that increased north pittsburgh s local residential rates and decreased its intrastate access rates 
second  the second quarter was favorably impacted by in final intercarrier settlement adjustments covering a two year period 
third  penn telecom experienced reductions in its effective intercarrier compensation rates  the most significant of which was a revision made between verizon and penn telecom in september of in the plu factor used to settle traffic between the companies 
at that time  the plu factor change resulted in an approximate per month decrease in intrastate access revenues recognized 
also  in conjunction with the fcc s access charge reform order  penn telecom s interstate access rates have been phased down over a three year period that began in the final decrease  which adjusted penn telecom s rates to mirror the incumbents rates  was effective june  and resulted in an approximate per month decrease in access revenues 
although penn telecom s access line growth contributed to an approximate increase in minutes of use mous on the network  the decreases in the effective intercarrier compensation rates described above resulted in an approximate decrease in access charges to carriers 
the largest of the factors contributing to the decrease the change in the plu factor occurred in  and we therefore do not expect to see the same magnitude of a decrease in revenues as compared to  as both years would reflect a full twelve months at the revised plu factor 
fourth  reductions in wireless intercarrier compensation rates contributed to a decrease in access revenues received from wireless carriers  despite a increase in billable mous 
in comparison  revenues from wireless traffic increased approximately for full year  as there were no material rate changes experienced in that year 
we expect to see a decrease in access revenues from wireless carriers again in  due to the fact that the majority of the decreases in rates were effective in the beginning of the third quarter of as such  will reflect a full year of the reduced rates in comparison to only six months in partially offset by special access revenues increased  mostly as a result of increases in the number of ds and ds circuits sold in both our ilec and clec territories 
in addition  an increase in trunking from cellular carriers and a network reconfiguration from an ixc also added to the revenue increase in this category 
the company records and analyzes into three main components the elements that comprise the long distance and access service revenues category 
the first category  access revenues  reflects mainly per mou sensitive access charges  universal service revenues received by the company and end user interstate access line charges assessed on customer bills 
the second category  special access  reflects the revenues received from high capacity circuits primarily ds s  ds s and oc s that are provided directly to end user customers  both in the company s ilec and clec territories  provisioned to other telecommunication carriers for connection to their end user customers and  provisioned for inter office trunking and transport and are billed under the special access tariff 
the third category  toll  represents amounts billed to end users for metro area  intralata  interlata and international toll 

table of contents overall toll revenues increased we have continued to be successful in bundling toll in our edge out markets in which the number of access lines grew by  with nearly a subscription rate 
our ability to increase our customer base has been partially offset by continuing pricing pressures from the introduction of aggressively priced flat rate toll packages from voip providers and intense pricing competition in the wireless market 
the decrease in telecommunication equipment sales of was mostly due to a decrease in new equipment sales 
operating expenses and net operating income total operating expenses decreased  or  during the change was the result of decreases in network and other operating expenses of  depreciation and amortization expenses of  state and local taxes of and telecommunications equipment expenses of the decrease in network and other operating expenses of  or  was primarily due to expenses for including  in charges associated with a workforce reduction program at our north pittsburgh subsidiary 
the charges consisted of  in severance and early retirement incentives and  in non cash curtailment charges associated with the acceleration of pension and postretirement healthcare obligations 
an approximately decrease in the costs of contracted oss services for pursuant to a newly negotiated agreement in the third quarter of partially offset by increases in direct costs associated with the growth in access lines and access line equivalents 
such direct costs include the fees paid for leasing unbundled network elements in the portions of our edge out markets that we do not provision over our own facilities and fees paid to terminate the increased local  toll and internet traffic generated by our growing customer base 
combined labor and benefit expenses for increased approximately  or  over excluding the  in one time workforce reduction charges in discussed above 
the increase has reversed the trend of double digit percentage increases in these costs experienced in the past several years 
the majority of the increase was due to increases in current benefit expenses mostly as a result of increases in medical insurance premiums 
payroll expense remained relatively flat  as included the full year effect of the benefit received from the workforce reduction whereas that program affected only approximately eight months of that benefit was offset by the effects of the normal year over year wage increases and slight increases in the number of personnel serving our edge out markets 
aggregate postretirement benefit expenses  as outlined in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k  also remained relatively constant for in comparison to excluding the  in one time curtailment charges included in the workforce reduction charges in discussed above 
this contrasts with double digit percentage increases in postretirement benefit expenses experienced over the past several years 
we have been able to curtail the growth in these expenses due to a decrease in the number of plan eligible participants as a result of the workforce reduction and by making additional contributions  above the minimum required level  into the defined benefit pension plan in both and in addition  we have benefited from the strong performance of the assets in the pension plan 
for  we expect aggregate postretirement benefit expenses to be consistent with costs 
although the steps we have taken to curtail the growth in these expenses  as outlined above  will continue to have a positive impact at reducing our expenses in  the decrease in the discount rate used to measure the obligations will result in aggregate expense being relatively constant on a year over year basis 

table of contents increases in auditing and accounting expenses of approximately as a result of the continued increases in rules and regulations promulgated by various market governing bodies  most notably the requirements imposed by the sarbanes oxley act of the decrease in consolidated depreciation and amortization expenses of  or  was the result of the capitalized costs and license fees  which were incurred with the conversion to a year compliant oss approximately six years ago  becoming fully depreciated in december of this resulted in a decrease in depreciation for that set of assets 
otherwise  depreciation expense for all other assets increased as the depreciable asset base gross property  plant and equipment grew over the course of the past year 
the decrease in state and local taxes of  or  was attributable mostly to nominal decreases in payroll taxes and gross receipts tax expense 
the decrease in telecommunication equipment expenses of  or  was attributable to decreases in the direct costs of goods for equipment sales  as the associated revenues have declined from the prior year 
in addition  contained a write off of approximately relating to obsolete inventory and spare equipment 
overall  the increase in total operating revenues of  coupled with the decrease in total operating expenses of  resulted in a  or  increase in net operating income in as compared to other items interest expense decreased during by due to the continued scheduled pay down of our federal financing bank ffb notes and capital lease obligation 
interest income increased during due to higher average invested cash balances as well as a slight increase in the average interest rate received on our temporary investments 
dividend income increased during as a result of a increase in the dividend received from the rural telephone bank rtb 
as a result of the prepayment of our rtb notes in december of  we were able during january of to convert our rtb class b stock into class c stock a class of stock eligible for cash dividends 
because we held the class c stock for only nine months of the bank s fiscal year ending in  the dividend we received in the fourth quarter of was pro rated 
in the fourth quarter of  the dividend we received was for a full twelve month period 
in addition  dividend income from the rtb stock was positively impacted by the dividend rate increasing from in to in equity income of affiliated companies increased  during due mainly to a  increase in the amount of income generated from the company s limited partner interests in three wireless partnerships 
these partnerships  all of which are majority owned and operated by verizon wireless  have continued to show strong growth in the number of customers and operating results 
we are also benefiting from a reduction in the partnerships switching costs which became effective in  which we estimate contributed approximately to the overall increase in earnings noted above 
in addition  for year over year comparative purposes  the results of operations for the rsa i partnership were negatively impacted by approximately as a result of the conversion costs incurred with the transition of the majority partnership interest from alltel communications to verizon wireless during and higher up front network investments and customer acquisition costs 
while we expect that the earnings of the wireless partnerships will continue to improve during  we do not anticipate the same magnitude of improvement as seen in although we will continue to benefit from the aforementioned reduction in switching costs  the incremental impact it had on earnings is considered non repetitive in nature that is  for comparison purposes  both and will contain the lower switching rates 
the changes in sundry expense net were not material

special access revenues increased during  mostly as a result of increases in the number of ds and ds circuits sold 
overall toll revenues increased  reversing the trend of the last several years of period over period decreases 
we continued to be successful during in bundling toll in our edge out markets in which there was a  growth in access lines  with nearly a subscription rate 
in addition  there was greater price stabilization in the toll market in the increase in other operating revenues of  or  was primarily due to two factors 
one was the growth of dsl revenues of approximately  as combined dsl lines both wholesale and retail sold increased from  as of december  to  as of december  the second factor was that 
table of contents the prior year period included approximately in charges associated with the bankruptcies of carriers  most notably worldcom and global crossing 
these charges were recorded as reductions in revenue in the decrease in directory advertising  billing and other services revenues of was mostly attributable to a slight decrease in directory advertising revenues  due to greater competition in a relatively soft advertising market 
the decrease in telecommunication equipment sales of was due to lower post sale support revenues 
operating expenses and net operating income total operating expenses increased  or  during the change was the result of increases in network and other operating expenses of   depreciation and amortization expenses of  and state and local taxes of  offset partially by a minor decrease in telecommunications equipment expenses of 
the increase in network and other operating expenses of  or  was primarily due to increases in the direct costs associated with the growth in access lines and access line equivalents 
such direct costs include the fees paid for leasing unes in the portions of our edge out markets that we do not provision over our own facilities  fees paid to terminate the increased local  toll and internet traffic generated by our growing customer base and overall general increases in sales and support areas 
in addition to the aforementioned costs  which normally increase as our customer base and network grow  the following costs also contributed to the increase in network and other operating expenses we recorded  in charges associated with a workforce reduction program at our north pittsburgh subsidiary 
the charges consisted of  in severance and early retirement incentives and  in non cash curtailment charges associated with the acceleration of pension and postretirement healthcare obligations 
our net periodic benefit costs for our pension plans and other postretirement benefits plans excluding the curtailment charges mentioned above increased  and  respectively 
the majority of the increase in pension costs was the result of the historically low interest rate environment and overall poor performance of the equity markets from through net periodic benefit costs are calculated at the beginning of a plan year and therefore our expected return on plan assets did not include the above average returns in the equity markets during 
the majority of the increase in other postretirement benefits expenses related to increases in our healthcare premiums that factor into the calculation of our ultimate obligations 
our healthcare costs exclusive of the postretirement healthcare plan costs mentioned above for current active employees increased approximately during as a result of sharp increases in premiums over the prior year 
the increase in consolidated depreciation and amortization expenses of  or  was the result of an increase in the depreciable asset base gross property  plant and equipment of over the course of the past year 
furthermore  a higher ratio of the new additions reflected data centric equipment  which has shorter useful lives than our average depreciable base 
the increase in state and local taxes of  or  was attributable to increases in a variety of taxes  including the public utility realty tax assessment purta tax  gross receipts tax  capital stock tax and payroll related taxes 
overall  the increase in total operating revenues of  coupled with the increase in total operating expenses of  resulted in a  or  increase in net operating income in as compared to 
table of contents other items interest expense decreased  during due to the prepayment of our rtb notes in december of and the continued scheduled pay down of our remaining ffb notes 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we incurred a charge associated with the accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs related to the rtb debt prepayment 
interest income decreased during due to lower average temporary investment balances during the year  as a result of the rtb debt prepayment  as well as the general decrease in short term money market rates for temporary investments 
equity income of affiliated companies increased during due to an increase in the amount of income generated from our investments in three wireless partnerships and in boulevard 
the growth rate in this category was lower than in prior years  partially due to a decrease in equity income from our rsa i partnership during this decrease was a result of conversion costs incurred with the transition of the majority partnership interest from alltel communications to verizon wireless during  increases in network investments and much higher customer growth in the last two quarters  which resulted in temporary decreases in income due to higher up front customer acquisition costs  such as equipment subsidies and commissions 
dividend income increased during primarily due to the receipt of in dividends from the rtb 
as a result of the prepayment of the rtb notes in december of  we were able during january of to convert our rtb class b stock into class c stock a class of stock eligible for cash dividends 
as we held the class c stock for nine months of the rtb s twelve month fiscal year  we received a pro rated cash dividend of in the fourth quarter of the  change in sundry expense net was due primarily to  of costs expended by the company in exploring strategic alternatives and business arrangements which were not incurred in in addition  included an investment loss of associated with the other than temporary decline in value of several equity securities 
liquidity and capital resources december  december  cash and temporary investments working capital long term debt including current maturities cash and temporary investments were  at december  as compared to  at december  the increase was a result of operating cash flows exceeding investment and financing requirements 
cash flows from operations were  for  a  increase from cash flows from operations were positively impacted by an increase in net income during as well as by the fact that the prior year period included  in pre tax in after tax cash severance and early retirement incentives 
in addition  contributions into the company s defined benefit pension plan were lower in as compared to cash flows used for investing activities were  for  a  increase from the increase was primarily the result of a  increase in capital additions  as included investments in equipment for our next generation of broadband products including multi megabit offerings  investments in network equipment for our planned voip product  an increase in purchases for fleet vehicles and expenditures for several building renovations 
the increase in cash outflows for capital additions was partially offset by an increase in net proceeds received from our wireless partnerships 

table of contents we expended  during for financing activities  which included cash dividends and the scheduled repayments of debt and capital lease obligations 
the amount was higher than the prior year period  mostly as a result of a increase in dividends paid pursuant to the company raising by 
per share the dividend it declared payable during the last three quarters of temporary excess funds were invested in short term cash equivalents with maturity dates scheduled to coincide with tax payment due dates  debt principal payments  dividend payment dates and other predictable cash needs 
we expect to continue the investment of such excess funds throughout  which should enable us to meet all short term obligations 
working capital levels at december  increased  from december   mostly due to the continued generation of cash flows from operations  which contributed to a  increase in cash and temporary investments as discussed above 
the decrease in long term debt was a result of scheduled principal repayments of  in we funded of our expenditures for property and equipment from operations cash flows and cash reserves 
therefore  no additional advances were requested from our available debt facilities 
in  north pittsburgh was granted approval for a loan from the ffb guaranteed by the rus in the maximum principal amount of  the total amount outstanding at december  to the ffb under this loan was  with all advances having a maturity date of december  the unadvanced amount of this facility as of december  was  north pittsburgh can draw against this facility through june  for qualified capital expenditure projects  as defined in the loan agreement  to furnish and improve telephone service in rural areas 
as of december   north pittsburgh had approximately  of qualified capital expenditures that were eligible to be drawn against this facility 
the notes payable to the ffb are secured by a supplemental mortgage agreement executed by north pittsburgh  which provides that substantially all of the assets of north pittsburgh  which approximate a net book value of  are subject to a lien or a security interest 
such agreement contains restrictions regarding dividends and other distributions by north pittsburgh 
under these restrictions  unless certain working capital levels  net worth levels and interest expense ratios are maintained  north pittsburgh is not permitted to pay dividends on its capital stock other than in shares of capital stock  or make any other distributions to its shareholder  or purchase  redeem or retire any of its capital stock or make any investment in affiliated companies 
as a result of these restrictions  approximately  of north pittsburgh s retained earnings was available for dividends and other distributions to the registrant as of december  taking into consideration these north pittsburgh restrictions  approximately  of our consolidated retained earnings was available for dividends and other distributions to our shareholders as of december  north pittsburgh also has available through june of a  line of credit with the rural telephone finance cooperative at a rate of prime plus 
no borrowings have been taken against the line of credit and there are no commitment fees associated with it 
the following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual obligations and purchase commitments as of december  payments due by period obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt interest on long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations operational support systems obligations purchase obligations total cash obligations 
table of contents represents total minimum lease commitments interest and executory costs are included 
we have entered into two contracts to outsource the majority of our operational support systems 
the first contract  which is effective through august of  has terms that make it non cancelable by the company through march of after that date  we have the right to cancel the contract but must pay a termination fee as defined in the contract 
a second contract was entered into in august of and is effective for a period of five years after the commencement of the processing of the first billing cycle we estimate the first billing cycle will occur in july of  which would make the contract effective through june of 
should we terminate the contract prior to the expiration of the term  we will be liable for minimum monthly usage payments as defined in the contract for the remaining term of the contract 
the figures presented in the table are estimates  due to the fact that a portion of the fee relating to billing services is variable  as it is partially calculated based on the number of service accounts  as well as the fact that the term of the second agreement is contingent upon our final implementation and commencement of billing 
the purchase obligations category represents various contractual arrangements and purchase commitments that we enter into in the ordinary course of business 
these obligations include purchase orders for capital expenditure plans  network maintenance contracts  multi year contracts for internet backbone services and company advertising sponsorships 
we expect cash flows provided by operating activities and cash reserves over the next twelve months to be sufficient to service long term debt and capital lease obligations  to pay dividends and to finance all capital projects 
we currently expect a capital expenditure program for in the range of  to  we expect to continue to have the necessary cash flows from operations and cash reserves to internally finance of our projected capital expenditures 
however  due to the low cost financing available through the rus for qualified north pittsburgh capital expenditures  we may request advancements from the rus facility in the future 
critical accounting policies certain accounting policies are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most subjective or complex judgments 
these policies are as follows revenue recognition revenues are recognized when local network  long distance  and access services are provided 
local service  intrastate long distance and intrastate access service revenues are subject to the jurisdiction of the pa puc 
revenues from equipment sales are recorded after equipment has been installed and accepted by the customer 
directory advertising revenues are recognized ratably over the period related to the directory publication 
our north pittsburgh subsidiary receives a portion of its interstate access revenues from pooling arrangements in which it participates with other telephone companies 
such pools  which are administrated by neca  are funded by access service charges regulated by the fcc 
revenues earned through these pooling arrangements  which are based on nationwide average costs applied to certain projected demand quantities  are initially recorded based on estimates and are subject to adjustments that may either increase or decrease the final amount of interstate revenues realized for a given period 
management monitors the activity of the pools and establishes accruals  if deemed necessary  for estimated obligations to the pool 
the calculations used to record these revenues are complex and involve a variety of estimates  and it is therefore possible that the ultimate amount realized from the pools could differ materially from our estimates  although historically we have not experienced significant out of period adjustments to our revenues as a result of participating in these pools 
valuation of accounts receivable we review accounts receivable to determine which are doubtful of collection 
in making the determination of the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider our accounts receivable aging schedules  history of write offs  relationships with our customers and the overall credit worthiness of our customers 

table of contents income taxes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
pension and other postretirement benefits we calculate the costs of providing retiree benefits under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
and sfas no 
the key assumptions used in making these calculations are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
the most significant of these assumptions are the discount rate used to value the future obligation  expected return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates 
we select discount rates commensurate with current market interest rates on high quality  fixed rate debt securities 
the expected return on assets is based on our current view of the long term returns on assets held by the plan  which is influenced by the historical performance of plan assets  asset allocation and other third party studies 
the medical cost trend rate is based on our actual medical claims and future projections of medical cost trends 
the judgments used in applying the above policies are based on our evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances as of the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
worldcom bankruptcy on july   worldcom petitioned the us bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
during  we realized reductions in revenue of as a result of the write off of pre petition amounts owed by worldcom to penn telecom and to north pittsburgh for intrastate services 
for interstate services  north pittsburgh was able to submit and recover from the neca pool the majority of the of uncollectible pre petition receivables owed by worldcom 
during march of  we negotiated a claim sale agreement for north pittsburgh s receivables with deutsche bank and achieved a recovery of of the total amount recovered  the which represented a recovery of interstate receivables was remitted back to the neca pool as we had already collected the entire write off from the pool in  resulting in no effect on the income statement 
the which represented a recovery of intrastate receivables was recognized in the income statement as a recovery of revenue during the first quarter of we sold penn telecom s claim for and recognized a recovery of revenue during the fourth quarter of workforce reduction and business restructuring during the second quarter of  we instituted a workforce reduction program at our north pittsburgh subsidiary 
this program  consisting of both layoffs and early retirement incentives  reduced the north pittsburgh workforce by people  or 
we recorded severance charges of  and during the second and third quarters of  respectively 
no severance accrual remained as of december   as all amounts had been paid prior to that date 
because of the workforce reduction program  we also recorded curtailment charges and completed a re measurement of our obligations under our pension and postretirement healthcare plans 
curtailment charges totaling  were recorded in the second quarter of both the  in severance charges and  in curtailment charges were recorded in the network and other operating expenses line item on our consolidated statement of income 

table of contents regulatory environment both north pittsburgh and penn telecom are subject to regulatory oversight by the pa puc for intrastate services and the fcc for interstate services 
the pa puc and the fcc have broad powers of supervision and regulation over public utilities with respect to service and facilities  rates and charges  securities  the encumbering or disposition of public utility properties  accounting and various other matters 
federal regulatory matters the fcc regulates the rates  the system of financial accounts for reporting purposes  rules for interconnection with other carriers  universal service funding  certain aspects of service quality  the use of numbering resources  compliance with the communications assistance for law enforcement act calea  and other aspects related to north pittsburgh s and penn telecom s provision of interstate services 
fcc interconnection rules in  congress passed the act  which has the goal of opening the telecommunications industry to further competition for all services  including the local exchange market 
the act prohibits state legislative or regulatory restrictions or barriers to entry regarding the provision of local telephone service 
it also requires most ilecs to interconnect with the networks of other telecommunications carriers  unbundle their services into network elements  offer their telecommunications services at wholesale rates in order to permit the resale of such services and allow other telecommunications carriers to locate equipment on their premises 
local exchange telephone carriers are also required to compensate each other for the transport and termination of calls 
the fcc has issued a number of rulemakings that continue to implement the requirements of the act and are intended to facilitate the resale of services at wholesale rates and provide for local number portability lnp  dialing parity  interconnection to any requesting carrier and access to network elements 
north pittsburgh s wireline operations are considered rural under the act and are exempt from certain of the foregoing obligations unless  in response to a bona fide request for interconnection  the pa puc removes that exemption 
more specifically  pursuant to the rural exemption provision of section f of the act  north pittsburgh is currently exempted from offering collocation  unes  wholesale discounts and certain other requirements of the act which originally pertained to non rural ilecs 
however  upon a petition by a potential competitor  the pa puc may grant the removal of north pittsburgh s rural exemption if it finds that the competitor s proposal is not unduly economically burdensome to north pittsburgh  is technically feasible and is consistent with the universal service provisions of the act 
in addition  the burden of proof in such a proceeding rests with the competitor 
the rural exemption does not  however  prevent facilities based competition in north pittsburgh s service area 
in march of  north pittsburgh received a request from a clec to negotiate an interconnection agreement 
accompanying the request for interconnection by the clec was a request for lnp 
as a result of that request  north pittsburgh implemented lnp capability in november of north pittsburgh is still in negotiations with the requesting clec  along with others who have requested interconnection since  with regard to final agreements 
the north pittsburgh implementation of lnp capability coincided with the fcc s ordered deadline for certain ilecs  including north pittsburgh  to implement wireline to wireless lnp by november  on january   the fcc extended the november  deadline until may  for certain rural local exchange carriers 
however  because north pittsburgh was already lnp capable  this extension did not apply to north pittsburgh 
the fcc s order regarding wireline to wireless lnp was challenged in court and  on march   the court of appeals issued its ruling 
under that ruling  north pittsburgh and penn telecom will be required to provide wireline to wireless lnp once the fcc prepares and publishes a regulatory flexibility analysis in regard to small businesses 
wireline to wireless lnp  when fully implemented  may cause both north pittsburgh and penn telecom to experience some loss of customers and the associated revenues  as customers will be able to migrate from wireline service to wireless service and still retain their current telephone numbers 

table of contents triennial review order on february   the fcc issued its tro regarding the act 
in that decision  the fcc eliminated unbundling requirements for ilecs in regard to broadband services provided over fiber facilities but continued to require unbundled access to mass market narrowband loops 
in addition  ilecs were not required to unbundle packet switching services 
the fcc further found that the high frequency portion of the loop  also referred to as line sharing  was no longer required to be provided as a une and would therefore be phased out over three years 
additionally  the fcc found that ilecs would no longer have to offer the local switching une to clecs for business customers served by high capacity loops 
the states had days to rebut this finding 
for mass market customers served by narrowband loops  the fcc set out specific criteria that states shall apply to determine if switching should no longer be available as an une 
upon a state ruling eliminating switching as an une for mass market customers  the fcc set forth a three year period for carriers to transition off une p  which is a service that bundles une switching with other unes such as une loop to provide the entire local service platform 
on march   the u 
s 
court of appeals for the district of columbia issued a decision in response to a number of court appeals filed in regard to the fcc s tro 
in that ruling  the court upheld the fcc s rules in regard to their conclusion that ilecs need not unbundle broadband loops provided through the utilization of new technologies such as hybrid fiber coaxial cable and fiber to the home 
subsequent fcc orders have also relieved incumbents of the unbundling requirements for fiber to the curb loops  where fiber is extended to within feet of a customer premises 
the court also agreed with the fcc that ilecs need not provide line sharing 
however  the court vacated and remanded a number of fcc rules regarding the fcc s finding that clecs were impaired without access to certain network elements such as local switching 
in addition  the court vacated the fcc s decision to delegate to the state commissions determinations related to mass market switching and dedicated transport elements 
on february   the fcc released its order on remand  setting forth the final rules regarding the unbundling obligations of the ilecs in response to the appeals court decision 
the fcc s revised une rules detailed the following changes clecs are not impaired without unbundled access to the une p combination comprised of local switching and une loop  or shared transport call related databases  or signaling networks used in connection with local switching 
clecs are not impaired without unbundled access to ds loops in any location served by a wire center with at least  business lines and four fiber based collocators 
clecs are not impaired without unbundled access to ds loops in any location served by a wire center with at least  business lines and four fiber based collocators 
clecs are not impaired without unbundled access to dark fiber loops 
clecs are not impaired without unbundled access to dedicated ds interoffice transport on routes connecting a pair of wire centers  where both wire centers contain at least four fiber based collocators or at least  business lines 
clecs are not impaired without unbundled access to dedicated ds or dark fiber interoffice transport on routes connecting a pair of wire centers  each of which contains at least three fiber based collocators or at least  business lines 
the fcc also set forth regulations that establish a mandatory transition plan to facilitate the transition by clecs from unes to alternative arrangements over either a twelve or eighteen month period depending on the une being eliminated 
at the end of the transition plan  the clec must have alternative facilities of its own  or an alternative arrangement with the ilec under either a tariff or commercial agreement 
on february   verizon pennsylvania  inc notified penn telecom regarding its implementation plan of the fcc order on remand 
at the same time  verizon also petitioned the pa puc to institute an arbitration proceeding regarding amendments to interconnection agreements that it has with clecs and cmrs providers 

table of contents while the fcc remand order was clear in regard to which unbundled elements are no longer required to be provided by ilecs  the definitions relating to the criteria for when a particular une is no longer required to be offered are still at issue and should be addressed in the arbitration proceeding 
on february   a number of parties filed a supplementary petition with the us court of appeals for the district of columbia  again seeking a writ of mandamus to compel the fcc to follow the court s previous directive in its earlier remand decision 
those parties filing the petition claim that the final fcc rules are still flawed and not in compliance with the court s decision 
action by the court is still pending 
we believe that the outcome of the final fcc rules regarding the unbundling rules  if not overturned  will have no immediate impact on our ilec operations  because we are not required to offer unes to competitors as long as we retain our rural exemption 
in regard to our clec operations  because we do not currently utilize line sharing and utilize our own switching for business customers which are served by high capacity loops  the elimination of these network elements will have no effect on our operations or revenues from our existing customer base 
with regard to the elimination of une p  we currently provision of our clec access lines or of our consolidated access lines utilizing une p 
although costs for une p loops will increase over time as the rates migrate to higher tariff rates  or commercially negotiated rates  our relatively low use of une p and the ability to migrate some of the lines to alternative provisioning methodologies will limit the overall impact on our current cost structure 
based on our interpretation of the rules concerning access to unbundled high capacity loops  interoffice transport facilities and dark fiber  we believe we will experience moderate increases in the overall cost to provision such loops and facilities during as a result of the fcc s order on remand 
we caution  however  that although the fcc s order on remand defines impairment of such circuits based on a review of the number of business lines and fiber based collocators in a serving wiring center  the practical definitions of what constitutes a business line or fiber based collocator have yet to be decided 
in a separate matter  the pa puc  which has the authority to set rates and terms for interconnection between carriers within the guidelines ordered by the fcc  has recently revised many of verizon s unbundled rates for loops as well as high capacity circuits 
although the revised rates reflect a mixture of both increases and decreases  based on the specific types of circuits and markets in which we operate  we should experience in an overall decrease in the average costs to provision our clec access lines as a result of the pa puc action 
the positive impact of the pa puc revisions to verizon s rates should mitigate the negative impacts of the fcc s order on remand  with potential slight decreases in the overall cost to provision access lines in our edge out markets experienced for we caution  however  that verizon has challenged the pa puc s revisions to verizon s rates in federal court 
intercarrier compensation and universal service on february   the fcc issued a further notice of proposed rulemaking fnprm in regard to the rules governing intercarrier compensation for the various types of traffic exchanged by telecommunications carriers 
under the current rules  rates charged for traffic vary by the type and or the jurisdiction of the traffic 
the fcc is considering replacing the current system of payments with a uniform regime where all types of traffic are compensated at a unitary rate 
in that proceeding the fcc is seeking comment on seven comprehensive reform proposals that have been submitted to the fcc from industry participants and other interested parties 
the fcc s goal is to put in place an intercarrier compensation mechanism that encourages the development of efficient competition  preserves universal service support which ensures affordable rates in rural and high cost areas  that is technologically and competitively neutral and that minimizes regulatory intervention and enforcement and relies on commercially negotiated contracts rather than rules and regulations 
both north pittsburgh and penn telecom receive a large percentage of their revenues from intercarrier compensation payments  and the outcome of this proceeding therefore may have a large impact on their revenue streams 
in 
table of contents addition  because universal service funding will be affected by any change in the current intercarrier compensation system  north pittsburgh s universal service funding from both the interstate and intrastate jurisdictions may be affected by the outcome of this proceeding 
on february   the fcc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking nprm proceeding to examine the regulatory treatment of voip 
while the fcc indicated its preference for minimal regulation  it also recognized the need to ensure that the provision of voip is consistent with social objectives including universal service  emergency  law enforcement access  consumer protection and disability access 
prior to the fcc s issuance of the nprm regarding voip  several companies had petitioned the fcc for declaratory rulings that their specific service offerings  which utilize some component of internet protocol ip  were exempt from access charges 
one of these filings was made by at t and one was made by pulver 
com 
the at t petition asked the fcc for a declaratory ruling that at t s phone to phone ip telephony service  which utilizes ip in the transport portion of the service  is exempt from access charges 
on april   the fcc released an order denying the at t petition and affirming that access charges do apply to toll calls that originate or terminate on the public switched telephone network pstn even if some portion of the call is transported utilizing ip 
in the pulver 
com order released on february   the fcc ruled that pulver 
com s free world dialup offering  which provides voice calling services utilizing ip between two broadband connections to the internet and which does not utilize the pstn at either end  was exempt from access charges 
while these two fcc rulings have addressed the applicability of access charges in regard to specific services that utilize ip to provide voice or toll calling services  various questions regarding the full scope of regulations that will apply to voip services in general are still unresolved and will be addressed in the voip nprm 
the outcome of this nprm proceeding will affect north pittsburgh and penn telecom because voip services compete directly with the local and toll service offerings of north pittsburgh and penn telecom  and both north pittsburgh and penn telecom receive a portion of their revenues from access charges  the applicability of which to various forms of ip traffic is being reviewed in the nprm 
as the outcome of this proceeding is unknown at this time  we are unable to determine the effect such action may have on our operations and revenues 
on december   level communications  llc  filed with the fcc a petition requesting that the fcc forbear from applying switched access charges to ip calls that utilize the pstn 
if the petition were approved  then voip traffic would presumably be settled at the lower local interconnection rate 
while it is unclear whether the fcc is legally permitted to grant the petition  should it do so both north pittsburgh and penn telecom would be affected by such a decision 
if the petition were to be granted  we believe that initially there would be a minimal impact on north pittsburgh s and penn telecom s services 
however  as the number of voip providers grows and the amount of voip traffic increases  access revenues would decline over a period of time 
the fcc must act on the petition by march  or it will be deemed approved 
it is expected that the fcc will take action before that date 
in february of  the fcc also issued a fnprm regarding the possible reformation of the system for assessing and recovering universal service fund usf monies 
in that proceeding  the fcc has asked for comment on whether it should assess carrier contributions based on the number and capacity of connections that contributing carriers provide to customers  rather than on the current method  which is based on the interstate revenues they earn 
should the fcc reform the current system for assessing and recovering usf monies  north pittsburgh  penn telecom and pinnatech would be affected by the change 
because the outcome of this proposal is unknown at this time  we are unable to determine the effect such action may have on our operations and revenues 

table of contents other federal regulatory matters in february of  the fcc issued a nprm regarding the possible classification of wireline broadband internet access as an information service rather than a telecommunications service 
should the fcc adopt this proposed rule  it may cause network based broadband offerings such as dsl services to be more lightly regulated by the fcc 
in this nprm  the fcc also asked whether it should extend usf requirements to not only facilities based wireline broadband internet service providers bisps but also wireless  cable tv and satellite bisps 
should the fcc extend a usf contribution requirement to all bisps  north pittsburgh  penn telecom and pinnatech would be affected 
because the outcome of this proceeding is unknown at this time  we are unable to determine the effect such action may have on our operations and revenues 
state regulatory matters the pa puc regulates the rates  the system of financial accounts for reporting purposes  certain aspects of service quality  billing procedures  universal service funding and other aspects related to north pittsburgh s and penn telecom s provision of intrastate services 
in addition  the pa puc sets the rates and terms for interconnection between carriers within the guidelines ordered by the fcc 
price regulation effective january   under a statutory framework referred to as chapter  north pittsburgh moved from rate of return regulation in the intrastate jurisdiction to an alternative form of regulation  which is a price cap plan 
under north pittsburgh s price cap plan  rates for non competitive intrastate services are allowed to increase based on an index that measures economy wide price increases less a productivity offset 
there is no limitation on earnings under this plan 
the terms of the plan also allow north pittsburgh to rebalance rates once each year to allow north pittsburgh to gradually realign its intrastate rate structure on a more rational cost and market basis in order to meet future competition 
in addition  as competition develops in the future  north pittsburgh may file with the pa puc to declare certain services competitive and thereby be freed from all rate regulation for those services 
in return for approval of the alternative form of regulation  north pittsburgh has committed to continue to upgrade its network in the future to ensure that all its customers will have access to broadband services 
that chapter legislation  which enabled north pittsburgh to operate under an alternative price cap form of regulation  expired due to legislative sunset provisions on december  thereafter  the pa puc on january  issued a statement of policy concluding that under the pennsylvania public utility code  as then in effect  the approved chapter alternative plans of regulation for all ilecs operating in pennsylvania would remain in effect and would be fully enforceable in all respects upon the ilecs after the sunset date of december  on november   act was signed into law in pennsylvania 
act implemented new chapter legislation  which continued many aspects of the former chapter provision but also added some additional options for ilecs in regard to alternative regulation 
under the new chapter  ilecs may commit to accelerate the deployment of broadband service capability to their entire service area and in exchange receive a reduction in  or elimination of  the productivity offset in their price index formula 
on february  north pittsburgh filed an amended alternative form of regulation and network modernization plan with the pa puc pursuant to act in that filing  in addition to modifying its prior chapter plan to comport with the new statute  north pittsburgh committed to accelerate its deployment of a ubiquitous broadband network throughout its entire service area from the previous commitment date of december  to december  in return for making this commitment  north pittsburgh will no longer be impacted by a productivity offset when calculating the price stability index component of its annual price stability mechanism filing 
north pittsburgh will also not have to contribute to certain new public policy 
table of contents funding obligations that were instituted as part of act the pa puc is expected to act on north pittsburgh s amended plan by the end of the second quarter of if the pa puc fails to act within days of the filing date  the amended plan is deemed approved 
other state regulatory matters in addition to the pa puc s revision of verizon s unbundled rates previously discussed under the triennial review order heading  there is another recent pa puc proceeding which could impact north pittsburgh and penn telecom 
on december   the pa puc adopted an order instituting an investigation regarding the intrastate access charges and intralata toll rates of rural carriers in pennsylvania  and the effect on those charges and rates if the pa puc were to reduce disbursements from the pennsylvania usf to the rural carriers or if it were to broaden the base of contributors to include carriers that do not currently pay into the fund 
the proceeding will also address the ramifications of recent changes to the pennsylvania public utility code that affect access rate setting for both rural lecs and clecs 
under the changes to the public utility code  the pa puc may not require a lec to reduce intrastate access rates except on a revenue neutral basis 
the new statute also sets limits on a clec s ability to charge intrastate access rates higher than the ilecs in the area in which they are offering service 
the procedures regarding the pa puc s implementation of these rate setting limitations will be determined in this proceeding 
this proceeding may affect both north pittsburgh s and penn telecom s ability to set access charge rates 
the proceeding also may affect the amount of funding that north pittsburgh receives from the pennsylvania usf and the amounts that north pittsburgh and penn telecom contribute to that fund 
the outcome of this proceeding is unknown at this time  so we are unable to determine the impact the proceeding may have on the revenues of north pittsburgh and penn telecom

sfas no 
requires that we record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which we incur a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development  and or normal use of the assets 
we would also record a corresponding asset associated with the retirement obligation that is depreciated over the life of the original asset 
subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation  the obligation will be adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation

we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio or for any other purpose
