item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  sanofi aventis reimbursed us for million  the full cost of the monoclonal antibody produced under this agreement 
the million was included in other income for the quarter and year ended june  laureate pharma  lp in april  immunogen and laureate pharma  lp laureate entered into a monoclonal antibody supply agreement 
under the terms of the agreement  laureate agreed to perform process qualification and manufacture one of our monoclonal antibodies pursuant to current good manufacturing practices 
under the terms of the agreement  we pay a stated price per manufactured batch of antibody  adjustable as defined in the agreement 
patents  trademarks and trade secrets we seek patent protection for our proprietary technologies  product candidates  and related innovations in the united states  europe  japan and elsewhere 
patents we have received in the united states include the following claiming a process for the preparation of certain maytansinoids  methods of preparation of conjugates composed of maytansinoids and cell binding agents  composition and use of novel taxanes  conjugates composed of taxanes and cell binding agents  and a method of antibody humanization 
in many cases  we have received a comparable patent outside the united states 
we have also submitted additional patent applications in the united states  europe  japan  and elsewhere covering proprietary small drug derivatives  methods of attachment to antibodies  tap compounds  antibody compounds and use of some of these product candidates and inventions for certain diseases 
we expect that our work will also lead to other patent applications 
in all such cases  we will either be the assignee or owner of such patents or have an exclusive license to the technology covered by the patents 
we cannot provide assurance  however  that the patent applications will issue as patents or that any patents  if issued  will provide us with adequate protection against competitors with respect to the covered products  technologies or processes 
in addition  many of the processes and much of the know how that are important to us depend upon the skills  knowledge and experience of our key scientific and technical personnel  which skills  knowledge and experience are not patentable 
to protect our rights in these areas  we require that all employees  consultants  advisors and collaborators enter into confidentiality agreements with us 
we cannot provide assurance  however  that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure of such trade secrets  know how or proprietary information 
further  in the absence of patent protection  we may be exposed to competitors who independently develop substantially equivalent technology or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information 
competition we focus on highly competitive areas of product development 
our competitors include major pharmaceutical and chemical companies  specialized biotechnology firms  and universities and research institutions 
many of these companies and institutions also compete with us in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific personnel 
many competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater scientific  research and product development capabilities  as well as greater financial  marketing and human resources than we do 
in addition  many specialized biotechnology firms have formed collaborations with large  established companies to support the research  development and commercialization of products that may be competitive with ours 
in particular  competitive factors within the antibody and cancer therapeutic market include the safety and efficacy of products  the timing of regulatory approval and commercial introduction  special regulatory designation of products  such as orphan drug designation  and the effectiveness of marketing and sales efforts 
our competitive position also depends on our ability to develop effective proprietary products  implement clinical development  production and marketing plans  including collaborations with other companies with greater marketing resources than ours  obtain patent protection and secure sufficient capital resources 
continuing development of conventional and targeted chemotherapeutics by large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies may result in the identification of new compounds that may compete with our product candidates 
in addition  monoclonal antibodies developed by certain of these companies have been approved for use as cancer therapeutics 
in the future  additional monoclonal antibodies may compete with our product candidates 
because of the prevalence of combination therapy in cancer and the variety of genes and targets implicated in cancer incidence and progression  we believe that products resulting from applications of new technologies may be complementary to our own 
such new technologies include  but are not limited to the use of genomics technology to identify new gene based targets for the development of anticancer drugs  the use of high throughput screening to identify and optimize lead compounds  the use of gene therapy to deliver genes to regulate gene function  and the use of therapeutic vaccines 
regulatory matters our products candidates are regulated in the united states by the fda in accordance with the united states federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  as well as the public health service act 
we expect that huc dm  hun dm and other of our tap compounds will be reviewed by the fda s center for drug evaluation and research  or cder 
in addition  each drug manufacturer in the united states must be registered with the fda 
the steps required before a new drug may be marketed in the us include performance of preclinical laboratory  animal  and formulation studies  the submission to the fda of an investigational new drug application  which must become effective before clinical trials may commence  the completion of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug  the submission of a new drug application to and its acceptance by the fda  and fda approval of the new drug application  including approval of all product labeling and advertising 
even if we  or our partners  obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates  the company  our products  and the facilities in which our products are manufactured are subject to continual review and periodic inspection 
the fda will require post marketing reporting to monitor the safety of our products 
manufacturing establishments are subject to periodic inspections by the fda and must comply with the fda s current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp 
in complying with cgmp  manufacturers must expend funds  time and effort in the areas of production  quality control and record keeping to ensure full technical compliance 
the fda stringently applies regulatory standards for manufacturing 
the regulatory issues that have potential impact on the future marketing of our products are summarized below 
clinical trials process before a new drug may be sold in the united states and other countries  clinical trials of the product must be conducted and the results submitted to the appropriate regulatory agencies for approval 
in the united states  these clinical trial programs generally involve a three phase process 
typically  phase i trials are conducted in healthy volunteers to determine the early side effect profile and the pattern of drug distribution and metabolism 
in phase ii  trials are conducted in groups of patients afflicted with the target disease to determine preliminary efficacy and optimal dosages and to expand the safety profile 
in phase iii  large scale comparative trials are conducted in patients with the target disease to provide sufficient data for the proof of efficacy and safety required by federal regulatory agencies 
in the case of drugs for cancer and other life threatening diseases  phase i human testing usually is performed in patients with advanced disease rather than in healthy volunteers 
because these patients are afflicted with the target disease  it is possible to design such clinical studies to provide results traditionally obtained in phase ii trials and they are often referred to as phase i ii studies 
we intend to conduct clinical trials not only in accordance with fda regulations  but also within guidelines established by other applicable agencies and committees 
whether or not fda approval has been obtained  approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing of the product in those countries 
regulatory approval in other countries is obtained through the various regulatory bodies governing pharmaceutical sales in those individual countries 
we intend to rely on foreign licensees to obtain regulatory approvals to market our products in foreign countries 
regulatory approval takes a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources 
approval times also depend on a number of factors including  but not limited to  the severity of the disease in question  the availability of alternative treatments and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials 
orphan drug designation the orphan drug act of generally provides incentives to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to undertake development and marketing of products to treat relatively rare diseases or diseases affecting fewer than  persons in the united states at the time of application for orphan drug designation 
we may pursue this designation with respect to products intended for qualifying patient populations 
a drug that receives orphan drug designation and is the first product of its kind to receive fda marketing approval for its product claim is entitled to a seven year exclusive marketing period in the united states for that product claim 
new drugs for serious or life threatening illnesses the fda modernization act allows the designation of fast track status to expedite development of new drugs  including review and approvals  and is intended to speed the availability of new therapies to desperately ill patients 
fast track procedures permit early consultation and commitment from the fda regarding preclinical and clinical studies necessary to gain marketing approval 
we may seek fast track status for some  or all  of our products 
fast track status also incorporates initiatives announced by the president of the united states and the fda commissioner in march intended to provide cancer patients with faster access to new cancer therapies 
one of these initiatives states that the initial basis for approval of anticancer agents to treat refractory  hard to treat cancer may be objective evidence of response  rather than statistically improved disease free and or overall survival  as had been common practice 
the sponsor of a product approved under this accelerated mechanism is required to follow up with further studies on clinical safety and effectiveness in larger groups of patients 
research and development spending during each of the three years ended june   and  we spent approximately million  million and million  respectively  on research and development activities 
during the years ended june  and  approximately of our full time equivalent research and development personnel were dedicated to our sanofi aventis collaboration 
during the year ended june   most of these expenditures were for company sponsored research and development 
employees as of june   we had full time employees  of whom were engaged in research and development activities 
seventy one employees hold post graduate degrees  of which hold phd degrees 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
none of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we have entered into confidentiality agreements with all of our employees  members of the board of directors and other consultants 
risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our company 
additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect our company 
if our tap technology does not produce safe  effective and commercially viable products  our business will be severely harmed 
our tap technology is a novel approach to the treatment of cancer 
none of our tap product candidates has obtained regulatory approval and all of them are in early stages of development 
our most advanced tap product candidates are only in the phase i or phase i ii stage of clinical trials 
our tap product candidates may not prove to be safe  effective or commercially viable treatments for cancer and our tap technology may not result in any meaningful benefits to our current or potential collaborative partners 
furthermore  we are aware of only one antibody drug conjugate that has obtained fda approval and is based on technology similar to our tap technology 
if our tap technology fails to generate product candidates that are safe  effective and commercially viable treatments for cancer  and fails to obtain fda approval  our business is likely to be severely harmed 
clinical trials for our product candidates will be lengthy and expensive and their outcome is uncertain 
before obtaining regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any product candidates  we and our collaborative partners must demonstrate through preclinical testing and clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans 
conducting clinical trials is a time consuming  expensive and uncertain process and may take years to complete 
our most advanced product candidates are only in the phase i or phase i ii stage of clinical trials 
historically  the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials have often not been predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials 
frequently  drugs that have shown promising results in preclinical or early clinical trials subsequently fail to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data necessary to obtain regulatory approval 
at any time during the clinical trials  we  our collaborative partners or the fda might delay or halt any clinical trials for our product candidates for various reasons  including ineffectiveness of the product candidate  discovery of unacceptable toxicities or side effects  development of disease resistance or other physiological factors  insufficient drug supply delays in patient enrollment  or other reasons that are internal to the businesses of our collaborative partners  which reasons they may not share with us 
the results of the clinical trials may fail to demonstrate the safety or effectiveness of our product candidates to the extent necessary to obtain regulatory approval or such that commercialization of our product candidates is worthwhile 
any failure or substantial delay in successfully completing clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates could severely harm our business 
if our collaborative partners fail to perform their obligations under our agreements  or determine not to continue with clinical trials for particular product candidates  our ability to develop and market potential products could be severely limited 
our strategy for the development and commercialization of our product candidates depends  in large part  upon the formation of collaborative arrangements 
collaborations may allow us to generate cash flow and revenue  offset some of the costs associated with our internal research and development  preclinical testing  clinical trials and manufacturing  seek and obtain regulatory approvals faster than we could on our own  successfully commercialize existing and future product candidates  develop antibodies for additional product candidates  and discover additional cell surface markers for antibody development and secure access to targets which  due to intellectual property restrictions  would otherwise be unavailable to our technology 
if we fail to secure or maintain successful collaborative arrangements  our development and marketing activities may be delayed or scaled back 
in addition  we may be unable to negotiate other collaborative arrangements or  if necessary  modify our existing arrangements on acceptable terms 
we have entered into collaborations with abgenix  biogen idec  boehringer ingelheim  centocor  genentech  millennium  and sanofi aventis 
we cannot control the amount and timing of resources our partners may devote to our products 
our partners may separately pursue competing products  therapeutic approaches or technologies to develop treatments for the diseases targeted by us or our collaborative efforts 
even if our partners continue their contributions to the collaborative arrangements  they may nevertheless determine not to actively pursue the development or commercialization of any resulting products 
also  our partners may fail to perform their obligations under the collaboration agreements or may be slow in performing their obligations 
our partners can terminate our collaborative agreements under certain conditions 
the decision to advance a product that is covered by a collaborative agreement through clinical trials and ultimately to commercialization is in the sole discretion of our collaborative partners 
if any collaborative partner were to terminate or breach our agreements  or fail to complete its obligations to us in a timely manner  our anticipated revenue from the agreement and development and commercialization of our products could be severely limited 
if we are not able to establish additional collaborations or any of our existing collaborations are terminated and we are not able to enter into alternative collaborations on acceptable terms  we may be required to undertake product development  manufacture and commercialization of our products ourselves  and we may not have the funds or capability to do this 
if our collaborators fail to successfully develop and commercialize tap compounds  our business will be severely harmed 
we depend on a small number of collaborators for a substantial portion of our revenue 
the loss of  or a material reduction in activity by  any one of these collaborators could result in a substantial decline in our revenue 
we have and will continue to have collaborations with a limited number of companies 
as a result  our financial performance depends on the efforts and overall success of these companies 
the failure of any one of our collaborative partners to perform its obligations under its agreement with us  including making any royalty  milestone or other payments to us  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
further  any material reduction by any one of our collaborative partners in its level of commitment of resources  funding  personnel  and interest in continued development under its agreement with us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
also  if consolidation trends in the healthcare industry continue  the number of our potential collaborators could decrease  which could have an adverse impact on our development efforts 
if a present or future collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination  their continued pursuit and emphasis on our product development program could be delayed  diminished or terminated 
for example  our collaborative agreement with vernalis was terminated in january  after british biotech merged with vernalis 
vernalis elected to relinquish its rights to develop and commercialize hun dm  the product subject to the collaborative agreement 
in addition  in august  aventis completed its merger with sanofi synthelabo  the combined entity is now sanofi aventis 
to date  this merger has not had an adverse effect on our collaboration 
we cannot predict what effect  if any  this merger will have on our collaboration with sanofi aventis in the future 
in addition  in february  boehringer ingelheim discontinued development of bivatuzumab mertansine 
under the agreement  boehringer ingelheim retained its right to use immunogen s dm tap technology and has exercised its right to create an anticancer compound to a different antigen target 
if our collaborators requirements for clinical product that we manufacture for them are significantly lower than we have estimated  our financial results and condition could be significantly harmed 
we procure certain components of finished conjugate including ansamitocin p  dm  dm  and linker on behalf of our collaborators 
in order to meet our commitments to our collaborators  we are required to enter into agreements with third parties to produce these components well in advance of our production of clinical materials on behalf of our collaborators 
if our collaborators do not require as much clinical material as we have contracted to produce  we may not be able to recover our investment in these components and we may suffer significant losses 
in addition  we run a pilot manufacturing facility 
a significant portion of the cost of operating this facility  including the cost of manufacturing personnel  is charged to the cost of producing clinical materials on behalf of our collaborators 
if we produce fewer batches of clinical materials for our collaborators  less of the cost of operating the pilot manufacturing facility will be charged to our collaborators and our financial condition could be significantly harmed 
we have a history of operating losses and expect to incur significant additional operating losses 
we have generated operating losses since our inception 
as of june   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
for the years ended june    and  we generated losses of million  million  and million  respectively 
we may never be profitable 
we expect to incur substantial additional operating expenses over the next several years as our research  development  preclinical testing  clinical studies and collaborator support activities increase 
we intend to continue to invest significantly in our product candidates 
further  we expect to invest significant resources supporting our existing collaborators as they work to develop  test and commercialize tap and other antibody compounds  and we or our collaborators may encounter technological or regulatory difficulties as part of this development and commercialization process that we cannot overcome or remedy 
we may also incur substantial marketing and other costs in the future if we decide to establish marketing and sales capabilities to commercialize our product candidates 
none of our product candidates has generated any commercial revenue and our only revenues to date have been primarily from upfront and milestone payments  research and development support and clinical materials reimbursement from our collaborative partners 
we do not expect to generate revenues from the commercial sale of our product candidates in the foreseeable future  and we may never generate revenues from the commercial sale of products 
even if we do successfully develop products that can be marketed and sold commercially  we will need to generate significant revenues from those products to achieve and maintain profitability 
even if we do become profitable  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
we and our collaborative partners are subject to extensive government regulations and we and our collaborative partners may not be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
we or our collaborative partners may not receive the regulatory approvals necessary to commercialize our product candidates  which could cause our business to be severely harmed 
our product candidates are subject to extensive and rigorous government regulation 
the fda regulates  among other things  the development  testing  manufacture  safety  record keeping  labeling  storage  approval  advertising  promotion  sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products 
if our potential products are marketed abroad  they will also be subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments 
none of our product candidates has been approved for sale in the united states or any foreign market 
the regulatory review and approval process  which includes preclinical studies and clinical trials of each product candidate  is lengthy  complex  expensive and uncertain 
securing fda approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to the fda for each indication to establish the product candidate s safety and efficacy 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretation  which may delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
the approval process may take many years to complete and may involve ongoing requirements for post marketing studies 
in light of the limited regulatory history of monoclonal antibody based therapeutics  regulatory approvals for our products may not be obtained without lengthy delays  if at all 
any fda or other regulatory approvals of our product candidates  once obtained  may be withdrawn 
the effect of government regulation may be to delay marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time  limit the indicated uses for which potential products may be marketed  impose costly requirements on our activities  and provide competitive advantage to other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
we may encounter delays or rejections in the regulatory approval process because of additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in fda policy during the period of product development  clinical trials and fda regulatory review 
failure to comply with applicable fda or other applicable regulatory requirements may result in criminal prosecution  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production or injunction  as well as other regulatory action against our product candidates or us 
outside the united states  our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving clearances from the appropriate regulatory authorities 
this foreign regulatory approval process includes similar risks to those associated with the fda approval process 
in addition  we are  or may become  subject to various federal  state and local laws  regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices  the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous substances  including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents  used in connection with our research work 
if we fail to comply with the laws and regulations pertaining to our business  we may be subject to sanctions  including the temporary or permanent suspension of operations  product recalls  marketing restrictions and civil and criminal penalties 
our product candidates will remain subject to ongoing regulatory review even if they receive marketing approval 
if we fail to comply with continuing regulations  we could lose these approvals and the sale of our products could be suspended 
even if we receive regulatory approval to market a particular product candidate  the approval could be conditioned on us conducting additional costly post approval studies or could limit the indicated uses included in our labeling 
moreover  the product may later cause adverse effects that limit or prevent its widespread use  force us to withdraw it from the market or impede or delay our ability to obtain regulatory approvals in additional countries 
in addition  the manufacturer of the product and its facilities will continue to be subject to fda review and periodic inspections to ensure adherence to applicable regulations 
after receiving marketing approval  the manufacturing  labeling  packaging  adverse event reporting  storage  advertising  promotion and record keeping related to the product will remain subject to extensive regulatory requirements 
we may be slow to adapt  or we may never adapt  to changes in existing regulatory requirements or adoption of new regulatory requirements 
if we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements of the fda and other applicable us and foreign regulatory authorities or previously unknown problems with our products  manufacturers or manufacturing processes are discovered  we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions  including restrictions on the products  manufacturers or manufacturing processes  warning letters  civil or criminal penalties  fines  injunctions  product seizures or detentions  import bans  voluntary or mandatory product recalls and publicity requirements  suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals  total or partial suspension of production  and refusal to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new drugs or supplements to approved applications 
unfavorable pricing regulations  third party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives applicable to our product candidates could limit our potential product revenue 
the regulations governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country 
some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed and  in many of these countries  the pricing review period begins only after approval is granted 
in some countries  prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted 
although we monitor these regulations  our product candidates are currently in the development stage and we will not be able to assess the impact of price regulations for at least several years 
as a result  we may obtain regulatory approval for a product in a particular country  but then be subject to price regulations that delay the commercial launch of the product and may negatively impact the revenues we are able to derive from sales in that country 
successful commercialization of our products will also depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate payment for our products will be available from government health administration authorities  private health insurers and other third party payors 
if we succeed in bringing a product candidate to the market  it may not be considered cost effective and reimbursement to the patient may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell it at a satisfactory price 
because our product candidates are in the development stage  we are unable at this time to determine their cost effectiveness 
we may need to conduct expensive studies in order to demonstrate cost effectiveness 
moreover  third party payors frequently require that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products 
because our product candidates are in the development stage  we do not know the level of reimbursement  if any  we will receive for any products that we are able to successfully develop 
if the reimbursement for any of our product candidates is inadequate in light of our development and other costs  our ability to achieve profitability could be affected 
we believe that the efforts of governments and third party payors to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare will continue to affect the business and financial condition of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies 
a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in the united states and other major healthcare markets have been proposed and adopted in recent years 
for example  the us congress enacted a limited prescription drug benefit for medicare recipients as part of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of while the program established by this statute may increase demand for any products that we are able to successfully develop  if we participate in this program  our prices will be negotiated with drug procurement organizations for medicare beneficiaries and are likely to be lower than prices we might otherwise obtain 
non medicare third party drug procurement organizations may also base the price they are willing to pay on the rate paid by drug procurement organizations for medicare beneficiaries 
in addition  ongoing initiatives in the united states have and will continue to increase pressure on drug pricing 
the announcement or adoption of any such initiative could have an adverse effect on potential revenues from any product candidate that we may successfully develop 
we may be unable to establish the manufacturing capabilities necessary to develop and commercialize our potential products 
currently  we only have one in house pilot scale manufacturing facility for the manufacture of conjugated compounds necessary for clinical testing 
we do not have sufficient manufacturing capacity to manufacture all of our product candidates in quantities necessary for commercial sale 
in addition  our manufacturing capacity may be insufficient to complete all clinical trials contemplated by us or our collaborators over time 
we intend to rely in part on third party contract manufacturers to produce sufficiently large quantities of drug materials that are and will be needed for clinical trials and commercialization of our potential products 
third party manufacturers may not be able to meet our needs with respect to timing  quantity or quality of materials 
if we are unable to contract for a sufficient supply of needed materials on acceptable terms  or if we should encounter delays or difficulties in our relationships with manufacturers  our clinical trials may be delayed  thereby delaying the submission of product candidates for regulatory approval and the market introduction and subsequent commercialization of our potential products 
any such delays may lower our revenues and potential profitability 
we may develop our manufacturing capacity in part by expanding our current facilities or building new facilities 
either of these activities would require substantial additional funds and we would need to hire and train significant numbers of employees to staff these facilities 
we may not be able to develop manufacturing facilities that are sufficient to produce drug materials for clinical trials or commercial use 
we and any third party manufacturers that we may use must continually adhere to current good manufacturing practices regulations enforced by the fda through its facilities inspection program 
if our facilities or the facilities of third party manufacturers cannot pass a pre approval plant inspection  the fda will not grant approval to our product candidates 
in complying with these regulations and foreign regulatory requirements  we and any of our third party manufacturers will be obligated to expend time  money and effort on production  record keeping and quality control to assure that our potential products meet applicable specifications and other requirements 
if we or any third party manufacturer with whom we may contract fail to maintain regulatory compliance  we or the third party may be subject to fines and or manufacturing operations may be suspended 
we have only one in house pilot manufacturing facility and any prolonged and significant disruption at that facility could impair our ability to manufacture products for clinical testing 
currently  we are contractually obligated to manufacture phase i and non pivotal phase ii clinical products for certain of our collaborators 
we manufacture this material in a pilot scale manufacturing facility 
we only have one such manufacturing facility in which we can manufacture clinical products 
our current manufacturing facility contains highly specialized equipment and utilizes complicated production processes developed over a number of years that would be difficult  time consuming and costly to duplicate 
any prolonged disruption in the operations of our manufacturing facility would have a significant negative impact on our ability to manufacture products for clinical testing on our own and would cause us to seek additional third party manufacturing contracts  thereby increasing our development costs 
even though we carry manufacturing interruption insurance policies  we may suffer losses as a result of business interruptions that exceed the coverage available under our insurance policies 
certain events  such as natural disasters  fire  political disturbances  sabotage or business accidents  which could impact our current or future facilities  could have a significant negative impact on our operations by disrupting our product development efforts until such time as we are able to repair our facility or put in place third party contract manufacturers to assume this manufacturing role 
we rely on single source suppliers to manufacture the primary component for our small molecule effector drug  dm and dm any problems experienced by either supplier could negatively affect our operations 
we rely on third party suppliers for some of the materials used in the manufacturing of our tap product candidates and cytotoxic agents 
our small molecule effector agents include dm and dm collectively dmx 
dm and dm are used in our tap product candidates in preclinical and clinical testing and are the subject of most of our collaborations 
one of the primary components required to manufacture dm and dm is their precursor  ansamitocin p currently  only one vendor manufactures and is able to supply us with this material 
any problems experienced by this vendor could result in a delay or interruption in the supply of ansamitocin p to us until this vendor cures the problem or until we locate an alternative source of supply 
any delay or interruption in our supply of ansamitocin p would likely lead to a delay or interruption in our manufacturing operations and preclinical and clinical trials of our product candidates and or those of our collaborators  which could negatively affect our business 
we also have an agreement with only one vendor to convert ansamitocin p to dmx 
any problems experienced by this vendor could result in a delay or interruption in the supply of dmx to us until this vendor cures the problem or until we locate an alternative source of supply 
any delay or interruption in our supply of dmx could lead to a delay or interruption in our manufacturing operations and preclinical and clinical trials of our product candidates or our collaborators product candidates  which could negatively affect our business 
any inability to license from third parties their proprietary technologies or processes which we use in connection with the development and manufacture of our product candidates may impair our business 
other companies  universities and research institutions have or may obtain patents that could limit our ability to use  manufacture  and market or sell our product candidates or impair our competitive position 
as a result  we would have to obtain licenses from other parties before we could continue using  manufacturing  marketing or selling our potential products 
any necessary licenses may not be available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
if we do not obtain required licenses  we may not be able to market our potential products at all or we may encounter significant delays in product development while we redesign products or methods that could infringe on the patents held by others 
we may be unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities necessary to successfully commercialize our potential products 
we currently have no direct sales or marketing capabilities 
we anticipate relying on third parties to market and sell most of our primary product candidates 
if we decide to market our potential products through a direct sales force  we would need to either hire a sales force with expertise in pharmaceutical sales or contract with a third party to provide a sales force to meet our needs 
we may be unable to establish marketing  sales and distribution capabilities necessary to commercialize and gain market acceptance for our potential products and be competitive 
in addition  co promotion or other marketing arrangements with third parties to commercialize potential products could significantly limit the revenues we derive from these potential products  and these third parties may fail to commercialize our potential products successfully 
if our product candidates or those of our collaborators do not gain market acceptance  our business will suffer 
even if clinical trials demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates and the necessary regulatory approvals are obtained  our product candidates may not gain market acceptance among physicians  patients  healthcare payors and the medical community 
the degree of market acceptance of any product candidates that we develop will depend on a number of factors  including the degree of their clinical efficacy and safety  cost effectiveness of our product candidates  their advantage over alternative treatment methods  reimbursement policies of government and third party payors  and the quality of our or our collaborative partners marketing and distribution capabilities for our product candidates 
physicians will not recommend therapies using any of our future products until such time as clinical data or other factors demonstrate the safety and efficacy of those products as compared to conventional drug and other treatments 
even if the clinical safety and efficacy of therapies using our products is established  physicians may elect not to recommend the therapies for any number of other reasons  including whether the mode of administration of our products is effective for certain conditions  and whether the physicians are already using competing products that satisfy their treatment objectives 
physicians  patients  third party payors and the medical community may not accept and use any product candidates that we  or our collaborative partners  develop 
if our products do not achieve significant market acceptance  we will not be able to recover the significant investment we have made in developing such products and our business would be severely harmed 
we may be unable to compete successfully 
the markets in which we compete are well established and intensely competitive 
we may be unable to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 
our failure to compete successfully may result in pricing reductions  reduced gross margins and failure to achieve market acceptance for our potential products 
our competitors include pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  chemical companies  academic and research institutions and government agencies 
many of these organizations have substantially more experience and more capital  research and development  regulatory  manufacturing  sales  marketing  human and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may develop products that are safer or more effective than our product candidates  obtain fda and other regulatory approvals or reach the market with their products more rapidly than we can  reducing the potential sales of our product candidates  devote greater resources to market or sell their products  adapt more quickly to new technologies and scientific advances  initiate or withstand substantial price competition more successfully than we can  have greater success in recruiting skilled scientific workers from the limited pool of available talent  more effectively negotiate third party licensing and collaboration arrangements  and take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily than we can 
a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are currently developing products targeting the same types of cancer that we target  and some of our competitors products have entered clinical trials or already are commercially available 
in addition  our product candidates  if approved and commercialized  will compete against well established  existing  therapeutic products that are currently reimbursed by government health administration authorities  private health insurers and health maintenance organizations 
we face  and will continue to face  intense competition from other companies for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  for relationships with academic and research institutions  and for licenses to proprietary technology 
in addition  we anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter our markets and as scientific developments surrounding antibody based therapeutics for cancer continue to accelerate 
while we will seek to expand our technological capabilities to remain competitive  research and development by others may render our technology or product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive or result in treatments or cures superior to any therapy developed by us 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights adequately  the value of our technology and our product candidates could be diminished 
our success depends in part on obtaining  maintaining and enforcing our patents and other proprietary rights and our ability to avoid infringing the proprietary rights of others 
patent law relating to the scope of claims in the biotechnology field in which we operate is still evolving  is surrounded by a great deal of uncertainty and involves complex legal  scientific and factual questions 
to date  no consistent policy has emerged regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents 
accordingly  our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents 
although we own several patents  the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or enforceability 
through litigation  a third party may challenge the validity or enforceability of a patent after its issuance 
also  patents and applications owned or licensed by us may become the subject of interference proceedings in the united states patent and trademark office to determine priority of invention that could result in substantial cost to us 
an adverse decision in an interference proceeding may result in our loss of rights under a patent or patent application 
it is unclear how much protection  if any  will be given to our patents if we attempt to enforce them and they are challenged in court or in other proceedings 
a competitor may successfully challenge our patents or a challenge could result in limitations of the patents coverage 
in addition  the cost of litigation or interference proceedings to uphold the validity of patents can be substantial 
if we are unsuccessful in these proceedings  third parties may be able to use our patented technology without paying us licensing fees or royalties 
moreover  competitors may infringe our patents or successfully avoid them through design innovation 
to prevent infringement or unauthorized use  we may need to file infringement claims  which are expensive and time consuming 
in an infringement proceeding  a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid 
even if the validity of our patents were upheld  a court may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the ground that its activities are not covered by our patents 
policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult  and we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights  particularly in countries where the laws may not protect such rights as fully as in the united states 
in addition to our patent rights  we also rely on unpatented technology  trade secrets  know how and confidential information 
third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques or otherwise gain access to or disclose our technology 
we may not be able to effectively protect our rights in unpatented technology  trade secrets  know how and confidential information 
we require each of our employees  consultants and corporate partners to execute a confidentiality agreement at the commencement of an employment  consulting or collaborative relationship with us 
however  these agreements may not provide effective protection of our information or  in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure  they may not provide adequate remedies 
if we are forced to litigate or undertake other proceedings in order to enforce our intellectual property rights  we may be subject to substantial costs and liability or be prohibited from commercializing our potential products 
patent litigation is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries 
third parties may assert patent or other intellectual property infringement claims against us with respect to our technologies  products or other matters 
any claims that might be brought against us relating to infringement of patents may cause us to incur significant expenses and  if successfully asserted against us  may cause us to pay substantial damages and limit our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims 
even if we were to prevail  any litigation would be costly and time consuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations 
furthermore  as a result of a patent infringement suit  we may be forced to stop or delay developing  manufacturing or selling potential products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property unless we enter into royalty or license agreements 
there may be third party patents  patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our potential products that may block or compete with our products or processes 
in addition  we sometimes undertake research and development with respect to potential products even when we are aware of third party patents that may be relevant to our potential products  on the basis that such patents may be challenged or licensed by us 
if our subsequent challenge to such patents were not to prevail  we may not be able to commercialize our potential products after having already incurred significant expenditures unless we are able to license the intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms 
we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
even if we were able to obtain licenses to such technology  some licenses may be non exclusive  thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us 
ultimately  we may be unable to commercialize some of our potential products or may have to cease some of our business operations  which could severely harm our business 
we use hazardous materials in our business  and any claims relating to improper handling  storage or disposal of these materials could harm our business 
our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals  biological materials and radioactive compounds 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and certain waste products 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by applicable laws and regulations  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
in the event of such an accident  we could be held liable for any resulting damages  and any liability could exceed our resources 
we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with these laws in the future 
failure to comply with these laws could result in fines and the revocation of permits  which could prevent us from conducting our business 
we face product liability risks and may not be able to obtain adequate insurance 
the use of our product candidates during testing or after approval entails an inherent risk of adverse effects  which could expose us to product liability claims 
regardless of their merit or eventual outcome  product liability claims may result in decreased demand for our product  injury to our reputation and significant adverse media attention  withdrawal of clinical trial volunteers  costs of litigation  distraction of management  and substantial monetary awards to plaintiffs 
we may not have sufficient resources to satisfy any liability resulting from these claims 
we currently have million of product liability insurance for the products that we manufacture on behalf of our collaborative partners and which are in clinical testing 
this coverage may not be adequate in scope to protect us in the event of a successful product liability claim 
further  we may not be able to maintain our current insurance or obtain general product liability insurance on reasonable terms and at an acceptable cost if we or our collaborative partners begin commercial production of our proposed product candidates 
this insurance  even if we can obtain and maintain it  may not be sufficient to provide us with adequate coverage against potential liabilities 
we depend on our key personnel and we must continue to attract and retain key employees and consultants 
we depend on our key scientific and management personnel 
our ability to pursue the development of our current and future product candidates depends largely on retaining the services of our existing personnel and hiring additional qualified scientific personnel to perform research and development 
we will also need to hire personnel with expertise in clinical testing  government regulation  manufacturing  marketing and finance 
attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success 
we may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition for such personnel among biotechnology  pharmaceutical and healthcare companies  universities and non profit research institutions 
failure to retain our existing key management and scientific personnel or to attract additional highly qualified personnel could delay the development of our product candidates and harm our business 
if we are unable to obtain additional funding when needed  we may have to delay or scale back some of our programs or grant rights to third parties to develop and market our products 
we will continue to expend substantial resources developing new and existing product candidates  including costs associated with research and development  acquiring new technologies  conducting preclinical and clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing products as well as providing certain support to our collaborators in the development of their products 
we believe that our current working capital and future payments  if any  from our collaboration arrangements  including committed research funding that we expect to receive from sanofi aventis pursuant to the terms of our collaboration agreement  will be sufficient to meet our current and projected operating and capital requirements for at least the next three to four fiscal years 
however  we may need additional financing sooner due to a number of factors including if either we or any of our collaborators incur higher than expected costs or experience slower than expected progress in developing product candidates and obtaining regulatory approvals  lower revenues than expected under our collaboration agreements  or acquisition of technologies and other business opportunities that require financial commitments 
additional funding may not be available to us on favorable terms  or at all 
we may raise additional funds through public or private financings  collaborative arrangements or other arrangements 
debt financing  if available  may involve covenants that could restrict our business activities 
if we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing when needed  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate expenditures for some of our development programs or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to internally develop and market 
if we are required to grant such rights  the ultimate value of these product candidates to us may be reduced 
fluctuations in our quarterly revenue and operating results may cause our stock price to decline 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to continue to do so in the future 
our revenue is unpredictable and may fluctuate due to the timing of non recurring licensing fees  decisions of our collaborative partners with respect to our agreements with them  reimbursement for manufacturing services  the achievement of milestones and our receipt of the related milestone payments under new and existing licensing and collaboration agreements 
revenue historically recognized under our prior collaboration agreements may not be an indicator of revenue from any future collaborations 
in addition  our expenses are unpredictable and may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to the timing of expenses  which may include obligations to manufacture or supply product or payments owed by us under licensing or collaboration agreements 
it is possible that our quarterly operating results will not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  causing the market price of our common stock to decline 
we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indicator of our future performance and should not be relied upon to predict the future performance of our stock price 
we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock 
we have not paid cash dividends since our inception and do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
therefore  shareholders will have to rely on appreciation in our stock price  if any  in order to achieve a gain on their investment 
item properties we lease approximately  square feet of laboratory and office space in a building located at sidney street  cambridge  massachusetts 
the sidney street lease expires on march   however  we have the option  subject to our landlord s approval  to extend the lease for an additional five year term pursuant to an amendment dated august  we sublease approximately  square feet of laboratory and office space in a building located at sidney street  cambridge  massachusetts 
the sidney street lease expires on october  we sublease approximately  square feet of space at sidney street  cambridge  massachusetts for general and administrative purposes 
the sidney street sublease expires on march  we also lease approximately  square feet of space in norwood  massachusetts  which serves as the company s pilot scale manufacturing facility and office space 
the norwood lease expires on june   but we have the option to extend the lease for an additional five year term pursuant to an amendment dated april  we believe that the manufacturing portion of the norwood facility complies with all applicable current good manufacturing practice regulations of the fda

we believe that the combination of our expertise in antibodies and cancers has resulted in the development of both proprietary product candidates and technologies 
our lead  proprietary  tumor activated certain prodrug  or tap  technology combines extremely potent  small molecule cytotoxic agents with monoclonal antibodies that recognize and bind specifically to tumor cells 
our targeted delivery technology is designed to increase the potency of these cancer specific antibodies  which allows our drugs to kill cancer cells with the potential to cause only modest damage to healthy tissue 
the cytotoxic agents we currently use in our tap compounds involved in clinical testing are the maytansinoid dm and dm molecules  chemical derivatives of a naturally occurring substance called maytansine 
we also use our expertise in antibodies and cancer to develop other types of therapeutics  such as naked antibody anticancer products 
we have entered into collaborative agreements that enable companies to use our tap technology to develop commercial product candidates containing their antibodies 
we have also used our proprietary tap technology in conjunction with our in house antibody expertise to develop our own anticancer product candidates 
under the terms of our collaborative agreements  we are entitled to upfront fees  milestone payments and royalties on any commercial product sales 
in july  we announced a discovery  development and commercialization collaboration with the sanofi aventis group formerly aventis pharmaceuticals  inc 
under the terms of this agreement  sanofi aventis gained commercialization rights to three of the most advanced product candidates in our preclinical pipeline and the commercialization rights to certain new product candidates developed during the research program portion of the collaboration 
this collaboration allows us to access sanofi aventis cancer targets and their clinical development and commercialization capabilities 
under the terms of the sanofi aventis agreement  we also are entitled to receive committed research funding of approximately million during the three year research program 
should sanofi aventis elect to exercise its contractual right to extend the term of the research program  we will receive additional research funding 
in august  aventis completed its merger with sanofi synthelabo and is now part of the sanofi aventis group 
to this date  this merger has not had any adverse effect on our collaboration 
we cannot predict  however  the effect  if any  that this merger may have on our collaboration with sanofi aventis in the future 
sanofi aventis must notify us no later than august  if they intend to extend the research program for the first additional month period that begins in september  under certain agreements  we receive our fully burdened cost to manufacture preclinical and clinical materials plus a profit margin 
currently  our collaborative partners include abgenix  inc  biogen idec  boehringer ingelheim international gmbh  centocor  inc  genentech  inc  millennium pharmaceuticals  inc  and sanofi aventis 
we expect that substantially all of our revenue for the foreseeable future will result from payments under our collaborative arrangements 
in august  vernalis completed its acquisition of british biotech 
in connection with this acquisition  the merged company  called vernalis plc  announced that it intended to review its merged product candidate portfolio  including its collaboration with immunogen on hun dm after discussion with vernalis  in january  we announced that we would take over further development of the product candidate  which will include the advancement of hun dm into our own clinical trial 
pursuant to the terms of the termination agreement executed on january   vernalis  which relinquished its rights to the product  will  at its own expense  complete study and was responsible for study through june  we are responsible for the further development of hun dm on january   we announced that we intended to advance our lead product candidates  cantuzumab mertansine and hun dm  into clinical trials to assess the clinical utility of the compound in certain indications 
in addition to continuation of the phase i ii study of hun dm for sclc study  we have initiated a clinical trial of hun dm in multiple myeloma study 
in october  we decided to move forward with an earlier version of cantuzumab mertansine that we call huc dm we initiated a phase i clinical trial with huc dm in june based upon the results of such clinical trials  if and when they are completed  we will evaluate whether to continue clinical development of these compounds  and  if so  whether we will seek a collaborative partner or partners to continue the clinical development and commercialization of either or both of these compounds 
to date  we have not generated revenues from commercial product sales and we expect to incur significant operating losses over the foreseeable future 
we do not anticipate that we will have a commercially approved product within the foreseeable future 
research and development expenses are expected to increase significantly in the near term as we continue our development efforts to include expanded clinical trials 
as of june   we had approximately million in cash and marketable securities 
we anticipate that our current capital resources and future collaboration payments  including the committed research funding due us under the sanofi aventis collaboration over the remainder of the three year research program  will enable us to meet our operational expenses and capital expenditures for at least the next three to four fiscal years 
we anticipate that the increase in total cash expenditures will be partially offset by collaboration derived proceeds including milestone payments and the committed research funding we will receive pursuant to the sanofi aventis collaboration 
accordingly  period to period operational results may fluctuate dramatically based upon the timing of receipt of the proceeds 
we believe that our established collaborative agreements  while subject to specified milestone achievements  will provide funding to assist us in meeting obligations under our collaborative agreements while also assisting in providing funding for the development of internal product candidates and technologies 
however  we can give no assurances that such collaborative agreement funding will  in fact  be realized 
should we or our partners not meet some or all of the terms and conditions of our various collaboration agreements  we may be required to pursue additional strategic partners  secure alternative financing arrangements  and or defer or limit some or all of our research  development and or clinical projects 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our collaborative agreements and inventory 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we estimate the period of our significant involvement during development for each of our collaborative agreements 
we recognize any upfront fees received from our collaborators ratably over this estimated period of significant involvement 
we generally believe our period of significant involvement occurs between the date we sign a collaboration agreement and projected fda approval of our collaborators product that is the subject of the collaboration agreement 
we estimate that this time period is generally six years 
the actual period of our involvement could differ significantly based upon the results of our collaborators preclinical and clinical trials  competitive products that are introduced into the market and the general uncertainties surrounding drug development 
any difference between our estimated period of involvement during development and our actual period of involvement could have a material effect upon our results of operations 
we recognize the million upfront fee we received from sanofi aventis ratably over our estimated period of significant involvement of five years 
this estimated period includes the term of the collaborative research program and two month extensions that sanofi aventis may exercise 
in the event our period of involvement is less than we estimated  the remaining deferred balance of the upfront fee will be recognized over this shorter period 
in january  our shared product license with vernalis plc terminated 
as a result we recognized million of revenue during the year ended june   related to the upfront fee that we received upon signing the original collaboration agreement with vernalis  which was deferred for accounting purposes 
in february  our full product license with glaxosmithkline terminated 
during the year ended june   we recognized  of revenue related to the glaxosmithkline upfront fee that remained in deferred revenue as of the termination date 
inventory we review our estimates of the net realizable value of our inventory at each reporting period 
our estimate of the net realizable value of our inventory is subject to judgment and estimation 
the actual net realizable value of our inventory could vary significantly from our estimates and could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations in any reporting period 
we consider quantities of dm and dm  collectively referred to as dmx  or ansamitocin p in excess of months projected usage that is not supported by collaborators firm fixed orders to be excess 
we fully reserve any such material identified as excess with a corresponding charge to research and development expense 
our estimate of months usage of dmx and ansamitocin p raw material inventory is based upon our collaborators estimates of their future clinical material requirements 
our collaborators estimates of their clinical material requirements are based upon expectations of their clinical trials  including the timing  size  dosing schedule and maximum tolerated dose of each clinical trial 
our collaborators actual requirements for clinical materials may vary significantly from their projections 
significant differences between our collaborators actual manufacturing orders and their projections could result in our actual months usage of dmx and ansamitocin p varying significantly from our estimated usage at an earlier reporting period 
during the year ended june   we recorded expense of million covering quantities of ansamitocin p and dmx that we have identified as excess based upon our inventory policy  and  to write down certain p and dmx batches to their net realizable value 
results of operations revenues our total revenues for the year ended june  were million compared with million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the million increase in revenues from to is primarily attributable to higher revenues from clinical materials reimbursement and research development support  as well as increases in license and milestone fees  and development fees  as discussed below 
the million increase in revenues from to is primarily attributable to committed research funding earned under our discovery and commercialization agreement with sanofi aventis  in addition to higher revenues from license fees and higher clinical materials reimbursement 
research and development support was million for the year ended june  compared with million for the year ended june  these amounts primarily represent committed research funding earned based on actual resources utilized under our discovery  development and commercialization agreement with sanofi aventis 
during the year ended june   this revenue also includes amounts earned for resources utilized under our development and license agreements with biogen idec and centocor 
the sanofi aventis agreement provides that we will receive a minimum of million of committed research funding during a three year research program 
we entered into the agreement with sanofi aventis in july  initiation of the committed research funding began on september  revenue from license and milestone fees for the year ended june  increased million to million from million in the year ended june  revenue from license and milestone fees for the year ended june  was million 
the increase in license and milestone fees from to is primarily attributable to the recognition of million related to the achievement of milestones under the sanofi aventis agreement from the initiation of clinical testing of ave  the anti cd tap compound  and for the preclinical advancement of the compound for certain b cell malignancies 
included in license and milestone fees for the year ended june  was million of revenue related to our termination agreement with vernalis which was executed in january revenue of million was related to the upfront fee that we received upon signing the original collaboration agreement with vernalis  which was deferred for accounting purposes 
the remaining  was recognized in june pursuant to our termination agreement with vernalis 
total revenue recognized from license and milestone fees from each of our collaborative partners in the years ended june   and is included in the following table year ended june  in thousands collaborative partner abgenix sanofi aventis boehringer ingelheim centocor genentech glaxosmithkline millennium vernalis total deferred revenue of million at june  represents payments received from our collaborators pursuant to our license agreements with them which we have yet to earn pursuant to our revenue recognition policy 
clinical materials reimbursement increased by approximately million to million in the year ended june  compared to million in the year ended june  we earned clinical materials reimbursement of million during the year ended june  during the years ended june   and  we shipped clinical materials in support of the hun dm  bivatuzumab mertansine  mln  and ave clinical trials  as well as preclinical materials in support of the development efforts of certain other collaborators 
the increase in clinical materials reimbursement in as compared to and is primarily related to the advancement of the clinical trials of bivatuzumab mertansine and mln  along with the initiation of clinical trials of ave millennium initiated a second clinical trial  a multi dose phase i ii study  with its compound mln during the year ended june  under certain collaborative agreements  we are reimbursed for our fully burdened cost to produce clinical materials plus a profit margin 
the amount of clinical materials reimbursement we earn  and the related cost of clinical materials reimbursed  is directly related to i the number of on going clinical trials our collaborators have underway  the speed of enrollment in those trials  the dosage schedule of each clinical trial and the time period  if any  during which patients in the trial receive clinical benefit from the clinical materials  and ii our production of clinical grade material on behalf of our collaborators  either in anticipation of clinical trials  or for process development and analytical purposes 
as such  the amount of clinical materials reimbursement and the related cost of clinical materials reimbursed may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year 
development fees increased  to million in the year ended june  compared to  for the year ended june  development fees were  in the year ended june  to date  our development fees represent the fully burdened reimbursement of costs incurred in producing research grade materials in accordance with good laboratory practices and developing antibody specific conjugation processes on behalf of our collaborators and potential collaborators during the early evaluation and preclinical testing stages of drug development 
the amount of development fees we earn is directly related to the number of our collaborators and potential collaborators  the stage of development of our collaborators products and the resources our collaborators allocate to the development effort 
as such  the amount of development fees may vary widely from quarter to quarter and year to year 
research and development expenses we report research and development expense net of certain reimbursements we receive from our collaborators 
our net research and development expenses consist of i research to identify and evaluate new targets and to develop and evaluate new antibodies and cytotoxic drugs  ii preclinical testing of our own and  in certain instances  our collaborators product candidates  and the cost of our own clinical trials  iii development related to clinical and commercial manufacturing processes and iv manufacturing operations 
during the three fiscal years ended june   our research efforts have been primarily focused in the following areas our activities pursuant to our discovery  development and commercialization agreement with sanofi aventis  our contributions to the preclinical and clinical development of hun dm and huc dm  process development related to clinical and commercial production of the hun antibody and hun dm conjugate  process development related to clinical and commercial production of the huc antibody and huc dm conjugate  process improvements related to the production of dm  dm and strain development of their precursor  ansamitocin p  operation and maintenance of our pilot scale manufacturing plant  process improvements to our tap technology  identification and evaluation of potential antigen targets  evaluation of internally developed and in licensed antibodies  and development and evaluation of additional cytotoxic agents 
dm and dm are the cytotoxic agents that we currently use in the manufacture of our two tap product candidates in clinical testing 
we have also investigated the viability of other maytansinoid effector molecules  which  collectively with dm and dm  we refer to as dmx 
in order to make commercial manufacture of dmx conjugates viable  we have devoted substantial resources to improving the strain of the microorganism that produces ansamitocin p  the precursor to dmx  to enhance manufacturing yields 
we also continue to devote considerable resources to improve other dmx manufacturing processes 
on january   we announced that pursuant to the terms and conditions of a termination agreement between vernalis and ourselves  vernalis relinquished its rights to develop and commercialize hun dm as a result  we regained the rights to develop and commercialize hun dm vernalis will complete study as of july   we assumed responsibility for study we are taking steps to expedite the patient enrollment in study additionally  we currently plan to initiate a clinical trial of hun dm in cd positive multiple myeloma 
we intend to evaluate whether to out license all or part of the development and commercial rights to this compound as we move through the clinical trial process 
in january  we announced that we would regain the development and commercialization rights to cantuzumab mertansine from glaxosmithkline  thereby terminating our collaborative agreement with this company 
in january  we announced that we planned to advance cantuzumab mertansine  or an improved version of the compound  into a clinical trial that we expected to manage 
in october  we decided to move forward in developing a modified version of cantuzumab mertansine called huc dm patient dosing was initiated for the phase i study of huc dm in june we intend to evaluate whether to out license all or part of the development and commercial rights to this compound as we move through the clinical trial process for this compound 
we licensed our three most advanced product candidates to sanofi aventis in under the terms of our discovery  development and commercialization collaboration 
these three product candidates are ave  an anti cd tap compound for acute myeloid leukemia  an anti igf r antibody  and a tap compound for certain b cell malignancies 
in december  sanofi aventis filed an investigational new drug application ind for the anti cd tap compound ave clinical testing of this compound was initiated in february the anti igf r antibody is a naked antibody directed against a target found on various solid tumors  including certain breast  lung and prostate cancers 
at june   pursuant to our collaboration research program with sanofi aventis  we continued to perform preclinical experiments to evaluate candidate antibodies and had identified a lead antibody product candidate and several alternate product candidates 
the third potential product candidate is directed at certain b cell malignancies  including non hodgkin s lymphoma  and is in development 
the cost to develop new products and advance those products to the ind stage of development can be significant 
under the terms of our discovery  development and research collaboration with sanofi aventis  they licensed three of our most advanced preclinical product candidates 
with the exception of those antibodies or antibody targets that are the subject of our preexisting or future collaboration and license agreements  during the term of our collaborative research program  we are required to propose for inclusion in the collaborative research program certain antibodies or antibody targets that we believe will have utility in oncology 
sanofi aventis then has the right to either include in or exclude from the collaborative research program these proposed antibodies and antibody targets 
if sanofi aventis elects to exclude any antibodies or antibody targets  we may elect to develop the products 
furthermore  sanofi aventis may only include a certain number of antibody targets in the research program at any one time 
sanofi aventis must therefore exclude any proposed antibody or antibody target in excess of this number 
over the original  three year term of the research program  we will receive a minimum of million of committed research funding and will devote a significant amount of our internal research and development resources to advancing the research program 
under the terms of the agreement  we may advance any tap or antibody products that sanofi aventis has elected not to either initially include or later advance in the research program 
the potential product candidates that may eventually be excluded from the sanofi aventis collaboration are in an early stage of discovery research and we are unable to accurately estimate which potential products  if any  will eventually move into our internal preclinical research program 
we are unable to reliably estimate the costs to develop these products as a result of the uncertainties related to discovery research efforts as well as preclinical and clinical testing 
our decision to move a product candidate into the clinical development phase is predicated upon the results of preclinical tests 
we cannot accurately predict which  if any  of the discovery research stage product candidates will advance from preclinical testing and move into our internal clinical development program 
the clinical trial and regulatory approval processes for our product candidates that have advanced or we intend to advance to clinical testing are lengthy  expensive and uncertain in both timing and outcome 
as a result  the pace and timing of the clinical development of our product candidates is highly uncertain and may not ever result in approved products 
completion dates and development costs will vary significantly for each product candidate and are difficult to predict 
a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control  could cause or contribute to the prevention or delay of the successful completion of our clinical trials  or delay or failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
the costs to take a product through clinical trials are dependent upon  among other things  the medical indications  the timing  size and dosing schedule of each clinical trial  the number of patients enrolled in each trial  and the speed at which patients are enrolled and treated 
product candidates may be found ineffective or cause harmful side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to progress through clinical trials than anticipated  may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals or may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable cost or with acceptable quality 
the lengthy process of securing fda approvals for new drugs requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals would materially adversely affect our product development efforts and our business overall 
accordingly  we cannot currently estimate  with any degree of certainty  the amount of time or money that we will be required to expend in the future on our product candidates prior to their regulatory approval  if such approval is ever granted 
as a result of these uncertainties surrounding the timing and outcome of our clinical trials  we are currently unable to estimate when  if ever  our product candidates that have advanced into clinical testing will generate revenues and cash flows 
research and development expense for the year ended june  increased million to million from million for the year ended june  research and development expense was million for the year ended june  the number of research and development personnel increased to at june  compared to at june  we had research and development personnel at june  research and development salaries and related expenses increased by million in the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  and increased by million in the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  facilities expense  including depreciation  also increased by million during the year ended june  as compared to the same period in and increased million in the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  the increase in as compared to was due to the addition of two manufacturing suites that were placed into service during the increase in as compared to was due to an increase in rent for the sidney street lease and expenses related to our expansion at sidney street  cambridge  massachusetts 
we expect future research and development expenses to increase as we continue development of our product candidates and technologies 
research and development in thousands research preclinical and clinical testing process and product development manufacturing operations research research includes expenses associated with activities to identify and evaluate new targets and to develop and evaluate new antibodies and cytotoxic agents for our products and in support of our collaborators 
such expenses primarily include personnel  fees to in license certain technology  facilities and lab supplies 
research expenses increased million to million in and increased million to million in the increase in research expenses in both and was primarily the result of an increase in salaries and related expenses 
the increase in salaries and related expenses was the result of an increase in personnel required to support the sanofi aventis collaboration 
preclinical and clinical testing preclinical and clinical testing includes expenses related to preclinical testing of our own and  in certain instances  our collaborators product candidates  and the cost of our own clinical trials 
such expenses include personnel  patient enrollment at our clinical testing sites  consultant fees  contract services  and facility expenses 
preclinical and clinical testing expenses increased million to million in and  to million in the increase in is substantially due to the cost of our clinical trials for hun dm also contributing to the increase in was an increase in contract services for certain preclinical studies related to huc dm additionally  in both and there was an increase in salaries and related expense  the result of an increase in personnel to support both our own as well as our collaborators preclinical and clinical activities 
process and product development process and product development expenses include costs for development of clinical and commercial manufacturing processes 
such expenses include the costs of personnel  contract services and facility expenses 
total development expenses increased  to million in and decreased  to million in the increase in as compared to is primarily the result of an increase in salaries and related expenses due to an increase in personnel 
the decrease in as compared to is primarily due to a decrease of million in contract services substantially related to reduced ansamitocin p and dmx process development activity 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in salaries and related expenses due to an increase in personnel and higher facilities expense 
manufacturing operations manufacturing operations expense includes costs to manufacture preclinical and clinical materials for our own product candidates and cost to support the operation and maintenance of our pilot scale manufacturing plant 
such expenses include personnel  raw materials for our own preclinical and clinical trials  manufacturing supplies  and facilities expense 
manufacturing costs related to the production of material for our collaborators are recorded as costs of clinical materials reimbursed in our statement of operations 
manufacturing operations expense increased million to million in and decreased million to million in the increase in as compared to was primarily the result of i an increase in salaries and related expenses  ii an increase in expenses to reserve for excess quantities of ansamitocin p and dmx in accordance with our inventory reserve policy  iii an increase in facilities expense related to the addition of two manufacturing suites that were placed into service during the year and iv lower overhead utilization from the manufacture of clinical materials on behalf of our collaborators 
the decrease in as compared to was primarily the result of i lower contract service expenses for antibody production  ii higher overhead utilization from the manufacture of clinical materials on behalf of our collaborators and iii lower expenses to reserve for excess quantities of ansamitocin p and dmx in accordance with our inventory reserve policy 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in salaries and related expenses 
antibody purchased in anticipation of potential future clinical trials was million in and million in as compared to million in resulting in lower contract services in  as noted above 
approximately   and  of the antibody expense during  and  respectively  related to the purchase of antibody in support of one of the preclinical product candidates that was licensed by sanofi aventis 
we received reimbursement of the total million amount in from sanofi aventis  as discussed below in other income 
the process of antibody production is lengthy as is the lead time to establish a satisfactory production process at a vendor 
accordingly  amounts incurred related to antibody production have fluctuated from period to period and we expect that these period fluctuations will continue in the future 
during fiscal  and  we recorded research and development expenses of million   and million  respectively  related to ansamitocin p and dmx inventory that we identified as excess based upon our inventory policy 
the higher write off in as compared to contributed to the increase in manufacturing operations expense in  as noted above 
reserve requirements for excess quantities of p and dmx are principally determined based on our collaborators forecasted demand compared to our inventory position 
due to the lead times required to secure material and the changing requirements of our collaborators  expenses to provide for excess quantities have fluctuated from period to period and we expect that these period fluctuations will continue in the future

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  increased million to million from million for the year ended june  general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  were million 
the increases in both years primarily relate to increases in salaries and related expenses 
there was an increase of approximately  in salaries and related expenses in compared to  as well as an increase of  in as compared to the increases in salaries and related expenses were substantially related to increases in personnel 
additionally  accounting  legal and audit related fees increased by approximately  in compared to primarily as a result of sarbanes oxley section implementation and attestation related expenses as well as increased patent related expenses 
interest income interest income for the year ended june  increased  to million from million for the year ended june  interest income for the year ended june  was million 
the increase in interest income in from is primarily the result of higher rates of return resulting from higher yields on investments 
the decline in interest income from to is attributable to a lower average cash and investments balance combined with lower rates of return 
net realized losses gains on investments net realized losses gains on investments were   and  for the years ended june    and  respectively 
the net realized losses in both and are attributable to the timing of investment sales  as is the gain recorded in other income other income for the year ended june  decreased million to  as compared to million for the year ended june  during the year ended june   we recorded in other income reimbursement of approximately million from sanofi aventis for the gmp production of antibody manufactured in support of one of the preclinical product candidates that was licensed by sanofi aventis 
included in other income during the year ended june  is million  which represents the final financial settlement of the glaxosmithkline collaboration 
liquidity and capital resources june  in thousands cash and short term investments working capital stockholders equity cash flows we require cash to fund our operating expenses  including the advancement of our own clinical programs  and to make capital expenditures 
historically  we have funded our cash requirements primarily through equity financings in public markets and payments from our collaborators  including equity investments  license and milestone fees and research funding 
as of june   we had approximately million in cash and marketable securities 
net cash used in operations was million  million and million during the years ended june   and  respectively 
the principal use of cash in operating activities for all periods presented was to fund our net loss 
the decrease in operational cash use from to is substantially due to a reduction in working capital that partially offset our fiscal net loss 
the principal changes in working capital were decreases in our accounts receivable and inventories due primarily to reduced demand by our collaborators for clinical material 
also contributing to the decrease in was million of upfront fees received for which revenue has been deferred 
the decrease in operational cash use from to was substantially due to amounts received from sanofi aventis  including the million upfront fee received in august and million of the million of committed research funding we earned during the year ended june  net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended june   and primarily represents cash outflows for capital purchases partially offset by proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities 
net cash provided by investing activities was million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively  and primarily represents cash inflows from the sale and maturities of marketable securities partially offset by capital expenditures 
capital purchases were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
capital purchases for the year ended june  consisted primarily of the build out of our existing development and pilot scale manufacturing facility located in norwood  massachusetts 
for the years ended june  and  capital purchases consisted primarily of the renovation of our new laboratory and office facility at sidney street  cambridge  massachusetts 
net cash provided by financing activities was  and  for the years ended june  and june   respectively 
net cash used for financing activities was million for the year ended june  for the years ended june  and  net cash provided by financing activities represents the proceeds from the exercise of  and  stock options  respectively 
for the year ended june   net cash used for financing activities principally represents the repurchase of million shares of common stock for million 
we anticipate that our current capital resources and future collaborator payments  including committed research funding that we expect to receive from sanofi aventis pursuant to the terms of our collaboration agreement  will enable us to meet our operational expenses and capital expenditures for at least the next three to four fiscal years 
we believe that our existing capital resources in addition to our established collaborative agreements will provide funding sufficient to allow us to meet our obligations under all collaborative agreements while also allowing us to develop product candidates and technologies not covered by collaborative agreements 
however  we cannot provide assurance that such collaborative agreement funding will  in fact  be received 
should we not meet some or all of the terms and conditions of our various collaboration agreements  we may be required to pursue additional strategic partners  secure alternative financing arrangements  and or defer or limit some or all of our research  development and or clinical projects 
contractual obligations below is a table that presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of june  payments due by period total less than one year years years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations unconditional purchase obligations total in addition to the above  we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to a third party as part of an in licensing arrangement 
payments under this arrangement generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because such milestones have not been achieved  such contingencies have not been included in the table above

recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of statement of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be expensed based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r must be adopted in the first annual period beginning after june   irrespective of the entity s fiscal year 
the company must adopt statement r on july  statement r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date or a modified retrospective method  which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the company intends to apply the modified prospective method of adoption in its application of statement r 
as permitted by statement  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
we currently estimate that the impact of adoption of sfas r in fiscal will result in compensation expense of million 
the impact of adoption of statement r beyond fiscal cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss per share in this note to our consolidated financial statements 
on november   the fasb issued statement no 
 inventory costs  an amendment to arb no 
 chapter the amendments made by statement clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and require the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the fasb and the international accounting standard board iasb noted that arb  chapter and ias  inventories  are both based on the principle that the primary basis of accounting for inventory is cost 
both of those accounting standards also require that abnormal amounts of idle freight  handling costs and wasted materials be recognized as period costs  however  the boards noted that differences in the wording of the two standards could lead to inconsistent application of those similar requirements 
the fasb concluded that clarifying the existing requirements in arb by adopting language similar to that used in ias is consistent with its goals of improving financial reporting in the united states and promoting convergence of accounting standards internationally 
the guidance is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not believe adoption of sfas will have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
although our investments are subject to credit risk  our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
however  due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration  interest rate risk is mitigated 
we do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item
