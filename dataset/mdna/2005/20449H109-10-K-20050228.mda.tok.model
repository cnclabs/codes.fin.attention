the discussion and analysis are intended to supplement and highlight information contained in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
financial institutions acquired by the company during the past three years and accounted for as purchases are reflected in the financial position and results of operations of the company since the date of their acquisition 
forward looking statements this annual report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act 
forward looking statements are typically identified by words or phrases such as believe  expect  anticipate  intend  estimate  may increase  may fluctuate  and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as will  should  would  and could 
forward looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions  estimates  risks and uncertainties that could cause actual conditions  events or results to differ materially from those stated or implied by such forward looking statements 
a variety of factors may affect the operations  performance  business strategy and results of the company including  but not limited to financial market volatility including the level of interest rates and effects of such interest rates on derivative contracts  the strength of the us economy in general and the strength of the local economies in which compass operates may be different than expected resulting in deteriorating credit quality  a reduced demand for credit or a weakened ability to generate deposits  the impact of changes in financial services laws and regulations  the effects of  and changes in  trade  monetary and fiscal policies and laws  including interest rate policies of the board of governors of the federal reserve system  technological changes  unfavorable judicial or regulatory proceedings or rulings  the impact of changes in accounting principles and practices  actions and initiatives by current and potential competitors  the ability to retain key personnel  the failure of assumptions underlying the establishment of reserves for loan losses  and significant delay in or inability to execute strategic initiatives designed to grow revenues and or control expenses 
if the company s assumptions and estimates are incorrect  or if the company or the subsidiary banks become subject to significant limitations as the result of litigation or regulatory action  then the company s actual results could vary materially from the forward looking statements made herein

critical accounting policies the accounting principles followed by the company and the methods of applying these principles conform with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states and with general practices within the banking industry 
the company s critical accounting policies relate to the allowance for loan losses  the assessment of hedge effectiveness of derivatives and other hedging instruments  the transfer of financial assets and the determination of when special purpose vehicles should be included in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income  income taxes and goodwill impairment 
these critical accounting policies require the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments which are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
accordingly  as this information changes  future financial statements could reflect the use of different estimates  assumptions and judgments 
certain determinations inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments and  as such  have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
allowance for loan losses management s evaluation process to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses combines four factors which involve the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments historical loss experience derived from analytical models  current trends  economic conditions and reasonably foreseeable events 
since current economic conditions can change and future events are inherently difficult to predict  the anticipated amount of estimated loan losses  and therefore the adequacy of the allowance  could change and these estimates may not reflect actual losses 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate and properly recorded in the financial statements 
for further discussion of the allowance for loan losses  see provisions for loan losses  net charge offs and allowance for loan losses in the management discussion and analysis section of this report 
derivative instruments in various segments of its business  the company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to changes in interest rates and market prices for financial instruments 
the application of the hedge accounting policy requires judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness  identification of similar hedged item groupings and measurement of changes in the fair value of hedged items 
the company believes that its methods for addressing these judgmental areas are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states and are in line with industry practices in assessing hedge effectiveness 
however  if in the future the derivative financial instruments used by the company no longer qualify for hedge accounting treatment and  consequently  the change in fair value of hedged items could not be recognized in earnings  the impact on the consolidated results of operations and reported earnings could be significant 
management believes hedge effectiveness is evaluated properly in preparation of the financial statements 
all of the derivative financial instruments used by the company have active markets and indications of fair value can be readily obtained 
consolidation the company utilizes certain financing arrangements to meet its balance sheet management  funding  liquidity and market or credit risk management needs 
the majority of these activities are basic term or revolving securitization vehicles 
because these financing arrangements are made with separate legal entities  they are not consolidated in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company evaluates whether these entities should be consolidated by applying various generally accepted accounting principles and interpretations 
in determining whether the financing entity should be consolidated  the company considers whether the entity is a qualifying special purpose entity qspe as defined in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
for nonconsolidation  sfas no 
requires the financing entity to be legally isolated  bankruptcy remote and beyond the control of the seller 
management believes these financing entities which qualify as qspes fulfill the nonconsolidation requirements specified in sfas no 
income taxes the calculation of the company s income tax provision is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments in its determination 
as part of the company s evaluation and implementation of business strategies  consideration is given to the regulations and tax laws that apply to the specific facts and circumstances for any transaction under evaluation 
this analysis includes the amount and timing of the realization of income tax liabilities or benefits 
management closely monitors tax developments in order to evaluate the effect they may have on the company s overall tax position 
management believes the income tax provision is adequate and properly recorded in the financial statements 
goodwill impairment goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
the company tests goodwill on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may have been impairment 
the goodwill impairment test estimates the fair value of each reporting unit  through the use of a discounted cash flows model  and compares this fair value to the reporting unit s carrying value 
the goodwill impairment test requires management to make judgments in determining the assumptions used in the calculations 
management believes goodwill is not impaired and is properly recorded in the financial statements 
net income and earnings per share in  the company reported record net income of million  an eight percent increase over net income of million in  which represented a nine percent increase from levels 
basic earnings per share for were  also a record  compared with per share in and per share in  representing a percent increase in and an percent increase in diluted earnings per share increased to in  a percent increase from per share in diluted earnings per share in increased percent over levels 
pretax income for increased million  or seven percent  over levels while income tax expense increased five percent over the same period 
the effective tax rate was percent for and percent for earning assets average earning assets in increased percent over levels due principally to a percent increase in investment securities  including both held to maturity and available for sale  and a percent increase in total loans 
the average earning asset mix in changed slightly from with loans comprising percent and percent of earning assets for and  respectively  while total investment securities accounted for the remaining percent and percent for and  respectively 
the mix of earning assets is monitored on a continuous basis in order to place the company in a position to react to interest rate movements and to maximize the return on earning assets 
loans total loans outstanding at year end increased nine percent over previous year end levels 
real estate construction loans increased percent  equity lines of credit increased percent  consumer installment indirect loans increased percent and consumer installment direct loans increased percent 
the increase in real estate construction loans and equity lines of credit is due to a favorable interest rate environment  which resulted in strong demand 
the increases in consumer installment indirect loans  which are primarily automobile loans  and consumer installment direct loans are a result of favorable interest rates and targeted growth in these markets 
residential real estate mortgage loans decreased five percent compared to levels 
the decrease in residential real estate mortgage loans reflects a securitization in the amount of million in on a managed loan basis  which includes loans that have been securitized  residential real estate mortgage loans increased seven percent over prior year levels 
for additional information  see note  managed loans  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
total loans outstanding at december  increased five percent over year end levels 
commercial real estate mortgage loans increased percent  equity lines of credit increased percent and consumer installment indirect loans increased percent 
the increase in commercial real estate mortgage loans and equity lines of credit was due to favorable interest rates and targeted growth 
equity loans decreased percent compared to levels and residential real estate mortgage loans decreased percent compared to levels 
the decrease in equity loans and residential real estate mortgages reflect securitizations in the amount of million and million  respectively  in excluding the effect of the securitizations  equity loans increased percent and residential real estate mortgage loans decreased percent over year end levels

the primary objectives of the company s investment strategy are to maintain an appropriate level of liquidity and provide a tool to assist in controlling the company s interest rate sensitivity position while at the same time producing adequate levels of interest income 
the company s investment securities are classified into one of three categories based upon management s intent to hold the investment securities i trading account assets and liabilities  ii investment securities held to maturity or iii investment securities available for sale 
investment securities held in a trading account are required to be reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
investment securities designated to be held to maturity are reported at cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts  with such amortization and accretion being determined by the interest method 
the company has the ability  and it is management s intention  to hold such securities to maturity 
management of the maturity of the portfolio is necessary to provide liquidity and control interest rate risk 
investment securities available for sale are recorded at fair value 
increases and decreases in the net unrealized gain or loss on the portfolio of investment securities available for sale are reflected as adjustments to the carrying value of the portfolio and as an adjustment net of tax to accumulated other comprehensive income 
fair values of trading account assets and liabilities  investment securities held to maturity and investment securities available for sale are based primarily on quoted or other independent market prices 
if quoted market prices are not available  then fair values are estimated using pricing models  quoted prices of instruments with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows 
fair values for trading account derivatives are estimated using pricing models 
interest earned on investment securities held to maturity  investment securities available for sale and trading account assets and liabilities is included in interest income in the consolidated statements of income 
net gains and losses on the sale of investment securities available for sale  computed principally on the specific identification method  are shown separately in noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income 
for additional financial information regarding the company s investment securities  see note  investment securities held to maturity and investment securities available for sale  in the notes to consolidated financial statements

at december   gross unrealized gains and losses in the investment securities available for sale portfolio were million and million  respectively  and recognized through other comprehensive income 
for an analysis of unrealized gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income  see note  comprehensive income  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
total average investment securities  including both held to maturity and available for sale  increased percent in after remaining stable in the increase in was primarily due to the purchase of investment securities available for sale of billion in and throughout  partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of available for sale securities of billion in and billion in additionally during  the company transferred approximately billion of investment securities available for sale to investment securities held to maturity 
at the end of  total investment securities  including both held to maturity and available for sale  decreased million from the end of  primarily due to a balance sheet repositioning in the third quarter of in which the company prepaid approximately million of fhlb advances and sold approximately million investment securities available for sale

during a period of rising rates  prepayment speeds generally slow on mbs and cmos with a resulting extension in average life  and vice versa during declining rates 
at december   given a basis point immediate and permanent parallel increase in rates  the expected average lives for mbs and cmos would be years and years  respectively 
similarly  given a basis point immediate and permanent parallel decrease in rates  the expected average lives for mbs and cmos would be and years  respectively 
the weighted average market prices as a percentage of par value for mbs and cmos at december   were and percent  respectively 
the market prices for mbs and cmos generally decline in a rising rate environment due to the resulting increase in average life  the below market yield on fixed rate securities and the impact of annual and life rate caps on adjustable rate securities 
the opposite is generally true during a period of declining rates 
at december   fixed rate mbs and cmos totaled billion and billion  respectively  with corresponding weighted average expected lives of and years 
adjustable rate mbs and cmos totaled million and million  respectively  with corresponding weighted average expected lives of and years 
substantially all adjustable rate mbs and cmos are subject to life rate caps  and mbs are also generally subject to a two percent annual cap 
the weighted average life rate caps at december  were and percent for mbs and cmos  respectively  and the corresponding weighted average coupon rates were and percent  respectively 
at december   given a basis point immediate and permanent parallel increase in rates  the estimated market prices for mbs and cmos would be and percent  respectively  of their actual market price as of each date 
given a basis point immediate and permanent parallel decrease in rates  the estimated market prices for mbs and cmos would be and percent  respectively  of their actual market price as of each date 
for additional information regarding the company s investment securities  see note  investment securities held to maturity and investment securities available for sale  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
trading account assets and liabilities securities carried in the company s trading account portfolio are primarily held for sale to institutional customers for their investment portfolios and generally are sold within days of purchase 
interest rate floors  caps and swaps are sold to customers as protection against interest rate fluctuation 
to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with these customer contracts  the company enters into offsetting derivative contract positions 
the company manages its credit risk of default by its corporate customers through credit limit approval and monitoring procedures 
both the derivative contracts entered into with the company s customers and the offsetting derivative positions are recorded at their estimated fair value 
market value changes on these derivative instruments are recognized in noninterest income in the period of change 
the volume of activity is directly related to general market conditions and reactions to the changes in the interest rate environment 
the average balance in the trading account assets portfolio decreased percent from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the average balance in the trading account assets portfolio increased million to million for the year ending december  the average balance in the trading account liabilities portfolio decreased percent to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the average balance in the trading account liabilities portfolio increased million to million for the year ending december  see note  off balance sheet activities  derivatives and hedging  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for a summary of interest rate contracts held in the trading account at december  and the following table details the composition of the company s trading account assets and liabilities at december  and trading account assets and liabilities december in thousands trading account assets us treasury and government agencies states and political subdivisions mortgage backed pass through securities collateralized mortgage obligations interest rate floors  caps and swaps total trading account assets trading account liabilities short sales interest rate floors  caps and swaps total trading account liabilities trading account liabilities related to interest rate floors  caps and swaps are classified as other liabilities and the short sale transactions are classified as short term borrowings in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
these short sale transactions could result in losses to the extent the ultimate obligation exceeds the amount of the recorded liability 
the amount of the ultimate obligation under such transactions will be affected by movements in the financial markets  which are not determinable until the point at which securities are purchased to cover the short sales 
the short sale transactions relate principally to united states government securities for which there is an active  liquid market 
the company does not expect the amount of losses  if any  on such transactions to be material because the short sale transactions are used as a hedge against offsetting long positions in the trading account 
deposits and borrowed funds average deposits totaled billion at december   a nine percent increase over prior year levels 
the increase in deposits was primarily attributable to a percent increase in noninterest bearing demand deposits  a percent increase in time deposits and a percent increase in interest bearing transaction accounts 
as part of its overall funding strategy  the company focuses on the mix of deposits and  in particular  maintaining an appropriate level of transaction accounts as a percentage of total deposits 
during  average transaction accounts made up percent of total deposits 
average interest bearing deposits made up percent of total average interest bearing liabilities in  down from percent in and percent in the following table summarizes the maturities of certificates of deposit of  or more and other time deposits of  or more outstanding at december  maturities of time deposits certificates other time of deposit deposits over over   total in thousands three months or less over three through six months over six through twelve months over twelve months while the company continues to emphasize funding earning asset growth through internal deposit generation  average earning asset growth has exceeded deposit growth 
as a result  the company has relied more on borrowed funds as a supplemental source of funding 
borrowed funds consist of federal home loan bank fhlb advances  subordinated debentures  other borrowings and short term borrowings  primarily in the form of federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short term borrowings 
average borrowed funds increased billion and million in and  respectively 
included in other short term borrowings are trading account short sales and the commercial paper of the company 
for a discussion of interest rates and maturities of fhlb and other borrowings  refer to note  fhlb and other borrowings  and note  capital securities and preferred stock  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
for additional information about deposits  see note  deposits  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following table presents the distribution of the company s short term borrowed funds and the weighted average interest rates thereon at the end of each of the last three years 
also provided are the maximum outstanding amounts of borrowings  the average amounts of borrowings and the average interest rates at year end for the last three years

liquidity management involves maintaining the company s ability to meet the day to day cash flow requirements of its customers  whether they are depositors wishing to withdraw funds or borrowers requiring funds to meet their credit needs 
without proper liquidity management  the company would not be able to perform the primary function of a financial intermediary and would  therefore  not be able to meet the needs of the communities it serves 
additionally  the parent company requires cash for various operating needs including dividends to shareholders  business combinations  capital injections to its subsidiaries  the servicing of debt and the payment of general corporate expenses 
the primary source of liquidity for the parent company is dividends from the subsidiary banks 
at december   the subsidiary banks could have paid additional dividends to the parent company of approximately million while continuing to meet the capital requirements for well capitalized banks 
also  the company has access to various capital markets 
the company does not anticipate any liquidity requirements in the near future that it will not be able to meet 
asset and liability management functions not only serve to assure adequate liquidity in order to meet the needs of the company s customers  but also to maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities so that the company can earn a return that meets the investment requirements of its shareholders 
daily monitoring of the sources and uses of funds is necessary to maintain an acceptable cash position that meets both requirements 
the asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through loan principal repayments  maturities of investment securities held to maturity and available for sale and  to a lesser extent  sales of investment securities available for sale and trading account assets 
other short term investments such as federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreements to resell and maturing interest bearing deposits with other banks  are additional sources of liquidity funding 
the liability portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity through various customers interest bearing and noninterest bearing deposit accounts 
federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short term borrowings are additional sources of liquidity and  basically  represent the company s incremental borrowing capacity 
these sources of liquidity are short term in nature and are used as necessary to fund asset growth and meet short term liquidity needs 
during  the company funded the billion of growth in average interest earning assets through increases in federal funds purchased  noninterest bearing deposits and interest bearing deposits 
average federal funds purchased increased billion  average noninterest bearing deposits increased million and average interest bearing deposits increased million 
for additional information about possible liquidity uses  see note  commitments  contingencies and guarantees  in the notes to consolidated financial statements

commitments payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands lines of credit standby and commercial letters of credit other contingent liabilities and commitments interest rate sensitivity management the company s net interest income and the fair value of its financial instruments are influenced by changes in the level of interest rates 
the company manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies established by its asset liability committee alco 
the alco meets periodically and has responsibility for approving asset liability management policies  formulating and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and or earnings and reviewing the interest rate sensitivity of the company 
management utilizes an interest rate simulation model to estimate the sensitivity of the company s net interest income to changes in interest rates 
such estimates are based upon a number of assumptions for each scenario  including the level of balance sheet growth  deposit repricing characteristics and the rate of prepayments 
the estimated impact on the company s net interest income sensitivity over a one year time horizon at december  is shown in the following table along with comparable prior year information 
such analysis assumes  consistently for both years  an immediate and sustained parallel shift in interest rates  a static balance sheet and the company s estimate of how interest bearing transaction accounts would reprice in each scenario 
net interest income sensitivity percentage increase decrease in interest income expense principal given immediate and sustained amount of parallel interest rate shifts earning assets  interest up down down bearing liabilities basis points basis points basis points in thousands december  assets which reprice in one year or less over one year liabilities which reprice in one year or less over one year total net interest income sensitivity percentage increase decrease in interest income expense principal given immediate and sustained amount of parallel interest rate shifts earning assets  interest up down down bearing liabilities basis points basis points basis points in thousands december  assets which reprice in one year or less over one year liabilities which reprice in one year or less over one year total net interest income sensitivity as shown in the previous table  the company s balance sheet became less sensitive to rising rates from december  to december  on the asset side  an increase in the proportion of variable rate loans decreased sensitivity to rising rates 
on the liability side  the decrease in sensitivity to rising rates is due to an increase in non interest bearing transaction accounts and a modest change in non term repricing assumptions 
also contributing to the change is a lower notional amount of derivatives 
in addition  all of these changes contributed to an increase in the loss in the down basis point scenario 
given the interest rate environment at both december  and  the calculations in the preceding table are based upon an immediate and sustained decrease of basis points and an immediate and sustained increase of basis points 
additionally  the table discloses interest rates at december  assuming an immediate and sustained decrease of basis points 
an immediate and sustained interest rate decrease of basis points at december  was not presented as many of the liabilities would have repriced to an interest rate of zero 
the company enters into various interest rate contracts not held in the trading account interest rate protection products to help manage the company s interest sensitivity 
such contracts generally have a fixed notional principal amount and include interest rate swaps and interest rate caps and floors 
interest rate swaps are contracts where the company typically receives or pays a fixed rate and a counterparty pays or receives a floating rate based on a specified index  generally the prime rate or the london interbank offered rate libor 
interest rate caps and floors purchased are contracts whereby the company receives  respectively  interest if the specified index rises above the cap rate or falls below the floor rate 
the interest rate risk factor in these contracts is considered in the company s interest rate risk management program

capital resources shareholders equity increased by million during following a million decrease during the increase in was the result of increases in retained earnings  due to increased earnings  offset partially by a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
dividends of million were declared on the company s common stock in  as compared to the million declared in the annual dividend rate in was per common share  a percent increase over the dividend payout ratio was percent for both and  and percent for the company intends to continue a dividend payout ratio that is competitive in the banking industry while maintaining an adequate level of retained earnings to support continued growth 
subsequent to year end  the company s board of directors approved a percent increase in the quarterly dividend rate  raising the annual dividend rate to an indicated per common share for this marked the th consecutive year the company has increased its dividend rate paid to shareholders 
a strong capital position  which is vital to the continued profitability of the company  also promotes depositor and investor confidence and provides a solid foundation for the future growth of the organization 
the company has satisfied its capital requirements principally through the retention of earnings 
the company s five year compound growth rate in shareholders equity of percent was achieved primarily through retained earnings 
in january and august of  the company announced that its board of directors authorized share repurchase programs allowing for the purchase of percent and percent  respectively  or approximately million shares and million shares  respectively  of the company s outstanding common stock 
through december   million shares had been repurchased under the january program at a cost of million 
approximately  of the total shares repurchased had been reissued for acquisitions and employee benefit plans 
at december   approximately million shares remained available for repurchase under the programs 
the timing and amount of purchases is dependent upon the availability and alternative uses of capital  market conditions and other factors 
the ratio of average common shareholders equity as a percentage of total average assets is one measure used to determine capital strength 
overall  the company s capital position remains strong as the ratio of average common shareholders equity to average assets for was percent compared to percent in and percent in in order to maintain this ratio at appropriate levels with continued growth in total average assets  a corresponding level of capital growth must be achieved 
the following table summarizes these and other key ratios for the company for each of the last three years 
return on equity and assets december return on average assets return on average equity dividend payout ratio average common shareholders equity to average assets ratio in addition to the capital ratios mentioned above  banking industry regulators have defined minimum regulatory capital ratios that the parent company and the subsidiary banks are required to maintain 
these risk based capital guidelines take into consideration risk factors  as defined by the banking industry regulators  associated with various categories of assets  both on and off balance sheet 
under the guidelines  capital strength is measured in two tiers that are used in conjunction with risk adjusted assets to determine the risk based capital ratios 
tier i capital is defined as common shareholders equity  excluding the net unrealized holding gain loss on available for sale securities except for net unrealized losses on marketable equity securities  plus perpetual preferred stock and certain debentures issued by the parent company  minus goodwill and other disallowed intangible assets 
other disallowed intangibles represent intangible assets  other than goodwill  recorded after february  total qualifying capital is defined as tier i capital plus tier ii capital components  which include such items as qualifying allowance for loan losses and qualifying subordinated debt 
at december   the company s tier i capital and total qualifying capital totaled billion and billion  respectively 
the percentage ratios  as calculated under the guidelines  were percent and percent for tier i and total qualifying capital  respectively  at year end these ratios are well above the minimum requirements of four percent for tier i capital and eight percent for total qualifying capital 
tier i capital increased by million  or percent  in primarily as a result of the increase in retained earnings 
two other important indicators of capital adequacy in the banking industry are the leverage ratio and the tangible leverage ratio 
the leverage ratio is defined as tier i capital divided by total adjusted average quarterly assets 
average quarterly assets are adjusted by subtracting the average unrealized gain loss on available for sale securities except for net unrealized losses on marketable equity securities  period end goodwill and other disallowed assets 
the tangible leverage ratio is defined similarly  except  by definition  all other intangible assets not previously excluded are removed from both the numerator and denominator 
the company s leverage ratio was percent at year end and percent at year end  while its tangible leverage ratio was percent at year end and percent at year end the following table shows the calculation of capital ratios for the company for the last two years 
capital ratios december in thousands risk based capital tier i capital tangible tier i capital total qualifying capital assets net risk adjusted assets adjusted quarterly average assets adjusted tangible quarterly average assets ratios tier i capital total qualifying capital leverage tangible leverage the regulatory capital ratios of the subsidiary banks currently exceed the minimum ratios of percent leverage capital  percent tier i capital and percent total qualifying capital required in for well capitalized banks as defined by federal banking regulators 
the company continually monitors these ratios to ensure that the subsidiary banks exceed these guidelines

off balance sheet activities sunbelt funding corporation in an effort to diversify its funding sources  the company sponsored the establishment of sunbelt funding corporation sunbelt  an asset backed commercial paper conduit  created as a wholly owned subsidiary of an independent third party 
sunbelt was structured as a qspe  as defined by sfas no 
 with a limited business purpose of purchasing highly rated investment grade debt securities from the company s trading account portfolio and financing its purchases through the issuance of p f rated commercial paper 
as of december   all assets sold to the conduit were performing and no significant gains or losses were recognized on the sales 
at december   all securities held by sunbelt were either aaa or aaa rated by at least two of the following nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations moody s investor service  standard poor s and fitch ratings 
approximately percent of the securities held by sunbelt at december  were variable rate 
sunbelt s total assets  which approximated market value  were billion and million at december  and  respectively 
the company realized fee income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  from sunbelt for providing various services including serving as liquidity provider  investment advisor and administrative agent 
at december  and  receivables from sunbelt were million and million  respectively 
there were no outstanding payables to sunbelt at either december  or the company  under agreements with sunbelt  may be required to purchase assets or provide alternative funding to the conduit in certain limited circumstances  including the conduit s inability to place commercial paper or a downgrade in the company s short term debt rating 
management believes if an event occurs  the company has the ability to provide funding without any material adverse effect 
the underlying assets are eligible investments for compass bank 
the commitments  which are renewable annually at the company s option  are for amounts up to billion 
no funding or purchase of assets has occurred as of december  there is currently a proposed amendment to sfas no 
 which could result in sunbelt no longer qualifying as a qspe 
if this amendment is finalized as currently proposed  and sunbelt does not change its structure  sunbelt would be consolidated into the company 
consolidation of sunbelt s assets into the company would not have a significant impact on the regulatory capital ratios  as the company would continue to exceed the minimum ratios required for well capitalized banks as defined by federal banking regulators

results of operations net interest income net interest income is the principal component of the company s income stream and represents the difference  or spread  between interest and fee income generated from earning assets and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
fluctuations in interest rates as well as volume and mix changes in earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can materially impact net interest income 
the following discussion of net interest income is presented on a taxable equivalent basis  unless otherwise noted  to facilitate performance comparisons among various taxable and tax exempt assets 
net interest income for increased slightly from million in to million in  following a million decrease in from levels 
interest income in remained relatively stable  decreasing million from the prior levels  a decrease of less than one percent 
the stability of interest income was caused by a basis point decrease in the yield on earning assets  offset by an increase of billion in the volume of average earning assets 
interest expense decreased million  or two percent  in due to a decrease of basis points on the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  partially offset by an increase of billion in the volume of average interest bearing liabilities 
in  interest income decreased eight percent caused by a basis point decrease in the yield on earning assets  partially offset by an increase of billion in the volume of average earning assets 
interest expense decreased percent in due to a basis point decrease in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  partially offset by a billion increase in the volume of average interest bearing liabilities 
the schedule on pages and provides detail regarding interest income  interest expense and net interest income due to changes in volumes  rates and mix of interest bearing assets and liabilities 
the yield on average earning assets decreased due to decreases in yields on all major earning asset categories  including a basis point decrease in the yield on investment securities available for sale and a basis point decrease in the yield on loans 
the decrease in yields was primarily attributable to the low level of interest rates and the corresponding impact on investment opportunities 
the increase in the volume of average earning assets was driven by a billion increase in investment securities  including both held to maturity and available for sale  and a billion increase in loans 
total interest expense decreased two percent in due to a decrease of basis points on the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  partially offset by a billion increase in the volume of average interest bearing liabilities 
interest expense on interest bearing deposits decreased million due to a basis point decrease in the rate  partially offset by an increase of million in the average volume 
for borrowed funds  which represent interest bearing liabilities that are not classified as deposits  a million decrease in interest expense on fhlb and other borrowings was the result of a basis point decrease in the rate paid combined with a percent decrease in the average balance 
conversely  a million increase in interest expense on federal funds purchased was the result of a billion increase in the average balance combined with a basis point increase on the rate paid 
the yield on average earning assets decreased due to decreases in yields on all asset categories  led by a basis point decrease in the yield on loans 
the decrease in yields was primarily attributable to the continued effects of the low level of interest rates and the corresponding impact on investment opportunities 
the increase in average earning assets was due primarily to a billion increase in loans 
additionally  during  the company transferred approximately billion of investment securities available for sale to investment securities held to maturity 
this transfer resulted in a decrease in average investment securities available for sale of million  offset partially by an increase of million in average investment securities held to maturity 
total interest expense decreased percent in due to a basis point decrease in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  partially offset by a percent increase in the average volume 
interest expense on interest bearing deposits decreased by percent as the result of a basis point decrease in the rate  partially offset by a million increase in the average volume 
for borrowed funds  which represents interest bearing liabilities that are not classified as deposits  a percent decrease in interest expense on federal funds purchased was the result of a basis point decrease in the rate paid  partially offset by a percent increase in the average balance 
similarly  a percent decrease in the average balance of securities sold under agreement to repurchase and a basis point decrease in the rate paid resulted in a percent decrease in interest expense in this category 
net interest income is commonly evaluated in terms of average rates using the net yield and the interest rate spread 
the net yield on earning assets is computed by dividing fully taxable equivalent net interest income by average total earning assets  excluding market adjustments for investment securities available for sale and hedges 
this ratio represents the difference between the average yield returned on average earning assets and the average rate paid for all funds used to support those earning assets  including both interest bearing and noninterest bearing sources of funds 
the net yield on earning assets decreased basis points to percent in after decreasing basis points to in the decrease in was due to the basis point decrease in the yield on average earning assets that was partially offset by a basis point decrease in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the decrease in was due to the basis point decrease in the yield on average earning assets that was partially offset by a basis point decrease in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate spread measures the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate spread eliminates the impact of noninterest bearing funds and gives a direct perspective on the effect of market interest rate movements 
during  the net interest rate spread decreased basis points to percent from the spread of percent 
during  the net interest rate spread decreased basis points from the spread of percent 
see the accompanying table entitled consolidated average balance sheets and rate volume variances on pages and for more information 
during  the net yield on earning assets was positively impacted by the company s use of interest rate contracts  primarily interest rate swaps  which increased the taxable equivalent net yield on earning assets by million 
the net yield on earning assets was positively impacted by interest rate contracts during and  which increased the taxable equivalent net yield by million in and million in the following table presents the actual and projected impact of the company s derivatives held for hedging purposes on net interest margin by quarter for fiscal years  and  excluding derivatives entered into by the company related to the company s mortgage banking activities

it should be noted that the majority of the decrease in the run rate for derivative income was realized prior to the fourth quarter of derivative instruments are subject to market risk 
while the company does have trading derivatives to facilitate customer transactions  the company does not utilize derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
the following table details information regarding the notional amount  maturity date and the receive fixed coupon rate for derivative instruments used for hedging activities as of december   excluding derivatives entered into by the company related to the company s mortgage banking activities 
the maturity date used in the table below is the first call date  when applicable

as is the case with cash securities  the market value of derivative instruments is largely a function of the financial market s expectations regarding the future direction of interest rates 
accordingly  current market values are not necessarily indicative of the future impact of the derivative instruments on net interest income 
this will depend  in large part  on the shape of the yield curve as well as the level of interest rates

the amount for each year is dependent upon many factors including loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquencies  management s assessment of loan portfolio quality  the value of collateral and general economic factors 
management monitors the entire loan portfolio  including loans acquired in business combinations  in an effort to identify problem loans so that risks in the portfolio can be identified on a timely basis and an appropriate allowance maintained 
loan review procedures  including loan grading  periodic credit rescoring and trend analysis of portfolio performance  are utilized by the company s loan review department in order to ensure that potential problem loans are identified early to lessen any potentially negative impact on the company s earnings 
management s involvement continues throughout the process and includes participation in the work out process and recovery activity 
these formalized procedures are monitored internally by the loan review department whose work is monitored by regulatory agencies that provide an additional level of review on an annual basis 
such internal review procedures are quantified in ongoing reports to senior management and are used in determining whether such loans represent probable loss to the company 
the allowance for loan losses is established by risk group as follows large classified loans  nonaccrual loans and loans considered impaired are evaluated individually with specific reserves allocated based on management s review 
smaller homogenous nonaccrual and adversely classified loans are assigned a portion of the allowance based on loan grading 
smaller past due loans are assigned a portion of the allowance using a formula that is based on the severity of the delinquency 
the remainder of the portfolio is allocated a portion of the allowance based on past loss experience and the economic conditions for the particular loan portfolio 
allocation weights are assigned based on the company s historical loan loss experience  in accordance with sfas no 
 in each loan category  although a higher allocation weight may be used if current conditions indicate that loan losses may exceed historical experience 
additionally  a portion of the allowance is for inherent losses which probably exist as of the valuation date even though they may not have been identified by the objective processes used for the allocated portion of the allowance 
this portion of the allowance is particularly subjective and requires judgments based upon qualitative factors 
some of the factors considered are changes in credit concentrations  loan mix  changes in underwriting practices  including the extent of portfolios of acquired institutions  historical loss experience and the general economic environment in the company s markets 
while the total allowance is described as consisting of separate portions  these terms are primarily used to describe a process 
all portions of the allowance are available to support inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses at december   was million  or percent of loans  compared with million  or percent of loans  at december   and million  or percent of loans  at december  the increase in the allowance  for both and  was to provide adequate coverage for loan growth and to maintain the level of coverage based upon current economic conditions 
as shown in the following table  net loan charge offs in were million  or percent of average loans  compared with million  or percent of average loans  in and million  or percent of average loans  in management believes that the allowance for loan losses at december  is adequate and appropriate given past experience and the underlying strength of the loan portfolio 
the following table sets forth information with respect to the company s loans and the allowance for loan losses for the last five years

it is the general policy of the company to stop accruing interest income and place the recognition of interest on a cash basis when any commercial  industrial or commercial real estate loan is days or more past due as to principal or interest and or the ultimate collection of either is in doubt  unless collection of both principal and interest is assured by way of collateralization  guarantees or other security 
accrual of interest income on consumer loans  including residential real estate loans  is suspended when any payment of principal or interest  or both  is more than days delinquent 
credit card loans are charged off before the end of the month when the loan becomes days past due with the related interest accrued but not collected reversed against current income 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  any interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current income unless the collateral for the loan is sufficient to cover the accrued interest or a guarantor assures payment of interest 
nonperforming assets at december   were million  a decrease of million from year end nonperforming loans decreased million from year end to million 
other real estate owned ore decreased million from year end the recorded investment in impaired loans at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the company had specific allowance amounts related to those loans of million and million  respectively 
there were no impaired loans without a specific allowance at december  or the average investment in these loans for the years ended december  and amounted to million and million  respectively

in addition  gains and losses realized from the sale of investment portfolio securities are included in noninterest income 
noninterest income totaled million in  an increase of percent from the prior year  and million in  an increase of percent from that reported in excluding gains on the sale of securities of million in and losses on investment securities in of  noninterest income increased percent or million from fee income from service charges on deposit accounts increased percent in following a percent increase in continued emphasis on low cost personal and small business checking account services  continued growth in revenues derived from the company cash management services and a revised pricing matrix in late contributed to the increased levels of income for both years 
increases for and were further influenced by the increase in both the number of accounts and balances outstanding in transaction deposit accounts 
card and merchant processing fees increased percent in after an increase of percent in the increase in both years is a direct reflection of the company s deposit gathering strategy that has resulted in an increase in the number of debit cards issued as well as an increase in debit card use by the company s customers 
increases in interchange income  merchant s discounts and the volume of credit cards also accounted for increased revenues in and insurance commissions increased approximately million to million in after an increase of million in to million 
income from this line item is primarily generated through commissions on the sales of insurance  primarily property and casualty  and other related products 
the company expanded its insurance business in and  acquiring four insurance companies throughout its geographic markets 
retail investment sales income  comprised primarily of mutual fund and annuity sales income  increased percent in after increasing percent in the increase in both and reflected improved market conditions 
asset management fees increased three percent in after an increase of nine percent in assets under administration  which is the primary driver of income  were billion  billion and billion at december   and  respectively 
the decrease in assets under management was due to the departure of a large non discretionary  low margin customer at the end of the reduction in fees resulting from the departure of this customer is not material 
corporate and correspondent investment sales decreased percent to million in  from million in and million in income from this line item is primarily generated through commissions on the sales of bonds to approximately correspondent banks and matched interest rate protection contracts to corporate customers 
the decrease in this item was due to market conditions  primarily the low interest rate environment  resulting in a decrease in sales of matched interest rate contracts 
noninterest expense noninterest expense totaled million in  an increase of nine percent from the prior year  and million in  an increase of six percent from that reported in excluding losses on the prepayment of fhlb advances in  noninterest expense totaled million  an increase of six percent from the increase in is due primarily to an increase in salaries  benefits and commissions from acquisition activity and the addition of new banking centers 
the number of full time equivalent employees increased by employees from december  to  at december  and increased by employees from december  to  at december  the increases in both and are primarily the result of expansion through both insurance agency acquisitions and the opening of new banking centers throughout both and equipment expense increased percent in and percent in the increases in equipment expense were primarily attributable to the company s expansion in existing markets as discussed above 
net occupancy expense increased by seven percent in following an eight percent increase in the increases in both and were due principally to the opening of new banking centers  normal renovation of existing properties and acquisitions 
marketing expense increased million in and million in the increases in marketing expense reflect a focused strategy to increase brand awareness throughout all of the company s markets 
communications expense decreased million in and increased million in the decrease in was due to cost savings initiatives implemented during late amortization of intangibles decreased percent in and decreased percent in the decreases in the current and prior year are a result of lower core deposit amortization from bank acquisitions completed in prior years 
merger and integration expenses decreased by percent in after decreasing percent in the decreases in and were the result of a shift in acquisition strategy from primarily bank acquisitions to fee based business acquisitions 
typically fee based business acquisitions result in less integration expense than bank acquisitions 
merger and integration expenses include compensation expenses  professional services  data processing systems conversion costs and broker fees incurred 
other noninterest expense increased nine percent in after a nine percent decrease in the increase in and the decrease in were primarily the result of higher than average expenses related to other real estate during and lower than average expenses related to other real estate during income taxes income tax expense increased million  or five percent  to million for the year ended december  the effective tax rate as a percentage of pretax income was percent in  percent in and in the statutory federal rate was percent during  and for further information concerning the provision for income taxes  refer to note  income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounting pronouncements consolidation of variable interest entities on january   the fasb completed its redeliberations of the project related to the consolidation of variable interest entities which culminated with the issuance of fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin states that if a business enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity  the assets  liabilities and results of the activities of the variable interest entity should be included in the consolidated financial statements of the business enterprise 
fin explains how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise assesses its interests in a variable interest entity to determine whether to consolidate that entity 
fin also requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among the parties involved 
variable interest entities that effectively disperse risks will not be consolidated unless a single party holds an interest or a combination of interests that effectively recombines risks that were previously dispersed 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
fin originally applied in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  however  in december  the fasb issued fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 which revised fin and required the adoption of fin or fin r for periods ending after december  fin and fin r do not apply to securitization structures that are qspes as defined within sfas no 
the company adopted the provisions of fin r on december  the company s securitization structure  as of december   met qspe standards  and therefore  was not affected by the adoption of fin or fin r 
additionally  in june  the fasb issued a proposed amendment to sfas  which would amend the requirements for qspe status 
sunbelt would no longer meet qspe requirements if the proposed amendment were finalized as currently written 
sunbelt is investigating potential modifications to its structure in order to continue off balance sheet treatment 
the adoption of fin r required the company to deconsolidate the subsidiary business trust s trust preferred securities 
the company s capital securities are classified as fhlb and other borrowings in the consolidated balance sheets 
accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer in december  the accounting standards executive committee acsec issued statement of position sop  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer 
the sop is effective for loans acquired in fiscal years beginning after december  the sop addresses accounting for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from an investor s initial investment in loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer if those differences are attributable  at least in part  to credit quality 
the sop applies to loans acquired in business combinations but does not apply to loans originated by the company 
management does not believe the provisions of this standard will have a material impact on the results of future operations 
application of accounting principles to loan commitments on march   the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 application of accounting principles to loan commitments 
sab no 
requires that when a company is recognizing and valuing a loan commitment at fair value  only differences between the guaranteed interest rate in the loan commitment and a market interest rate should be included 
any expected future cash flows related to the customer relationships or loan servicing should be excluded from the fair value measurement 
the expected future cash flows that are excluded from the fair value determination include anticipated fees for servicing the funded loan  late payment charges  other ancillary fees  or other cash flows from servicing rights 
the guidance in sab no 
is effective for mortgage loan commitments that are accounted for as derivatives and are entered into after march  the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the financial condition or the results of operations of the company 
share based payments on december   the fasb issued sfas r  share based payments 
sfas r requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
this statement establishes the fair value method for measurement and requires all entities to apply this fair value method in accounting for share based payment transactions 
the provisions of the sfas r are effective for all share based awards granted after july  and to share based awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after that date 
management does not believe the results of the adoption of this standard will differ materially from the previously disclosed pro forma information 
impact of inflation and changing prices a bank s asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of an industrial company in that virtually all assets and liabilities of a bank are monetary in nature 
management believes the impact of inflation on financial results depends upon the company s ability to react to changes in interest rates and  by such reaction  reduce the inflationary impact on performance 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction  or at the same magnitude  as the prices of other goods and services 
as discussed previously  management seeks to manage the relationship between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation 
various information shown elsewhere in this annual report on form k will assist in the understanding of how well the company is positioned to react to changing interest rates and inflationary trends 
in particular  the summary of net interest income  the maturity distributions  the compositions of the loan and securities portfolios  the data on the interest sensitivity of loans and deposits and the information related to off balance sheet hedging activities discussed in note  off balance sheet activities  derivatives and hedging  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  should be considered
