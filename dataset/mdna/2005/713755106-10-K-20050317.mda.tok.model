item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
the following text contains references to years   and  which refer to our fiscal years ending or ended december   january   january  and december   respectively  unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires 
we use a week fiscal year ending on the saturday closest to december consequently  we periodically have a week fiscal year 
our year was a week fiscal year 
overview we earn revenues primarily from the sale of food and non food products to the foodservice  or food away from home  industry 
we also sell pre cut produce to food retailers 
our expenses consist mainly of cost of goods sold  which includes the amounts paid to manufacturers or growers for products and processing costs of our fresh cut produce  and operating expenses  which include primarily labor related expenses  delivery costs and occupancy expenses related to our facilities 
for discussion of our business and strategies  see the business section of this form k 
according to industry research  nearly half of all meals are consumed away from home and approximately percent of all meals are consumed in automobiles 
another industry research firm is projecting foodservice distributor sales to continue to grow in we believe the trends that are fueling the demand for food away from home include the aging baby boomer generation  rising incomes and more women working outside of the home 
according to industry research  older adults on average spend significantly more on food away from home than younger adults do 
in addition  younger and higher income consumers are increasingly starved for time and looking for ways to save time by shifting meal preparation to others by dining out or buying prepared or convenience foods 
the foodservice distribution industry is fragmented and consolidating 
in the last decade  the largest broadline foodservice distributors have significantly increased their collective market share through both acquiring smaller foodservice distributors and internal growth 
over the past decade  we have supplemented our internal growth through selective  strategic acquisitions 
we believe that the consolidation trends in the foodservice distribution industry will continue to present acquisition opportunities for us 
consumers are seeking healthier menu choices 
several national casual dining restaurants  including certain of our customers  have introduced low carb menu items in an effort to meet the demands of consumers seeking to reduce their carbohydrate intake 
in addition  in an effort to reduce meal preparation time  consumers are seeking prepared or partially prepared food items from retail establishments 
our fresh express branded products sold by retailers are targeting ready to eat convenience foods  which we believe is one of the fastest growing categories for retailers 
our net sales in increased over  with all of our sales growth coming from existing operations 
our fiscal year included a rd week  which added approximately million to net sales in food price inflation contributed approximately to our growth in net sales in our broadline and customized segments  in particular  experienced significant inflation in gross profit margin  which we define as gross profit as a percentage of net sales  declined in compared to  driven primarily by our inability to leverage our cost infrastructure in the fresh cut segment as we transition our customer and product mix to a more stable base of business 
gross margins were also negatively impacted by a shift in product mix toward more center of the plate products in the broadline segment and by the impact of food product inflation in our customized segment  which operates primarily on a fixed fee per case basis 
our operating expense ratio  which we define as operating expenses as a percentage of net sales  increased in compared to higher fuel and insurance costs in all of our segments contributed to the increase in the operating expense ratio in compared to in addition  our fresh cut segment experienced increased warehouse and delivery expenses related primarily to inefficiencies in our production and distribution network because of the rationalization of certain foodservice customers 
selling expenses also increased in fresh cut due to increased promotional spending 
broadline s operating expenses were affected by incremental start up costs related to new multi unit business 
we were able to offset these increased costs in broadline with improved operating efficiencies 
going forward  we continue to be very focused on executing our strategies  adding new capacity and driving operational improvements in each of our business segments 
we continue to seek innovative means of servicing our customers to distinguish ourselves from others in the marketplace 

table of contents sale of fresh cut segment in september  we announced that we were considering strategic alternatives for our fresh cut produce business 
the alternatives we evaluated included  but were not limited to  the possible sale of the segment as an ongoing business  the creation of a stand alone company operating the fresh cut produce business  and keeping the fresh cut segment as part of pfg 
we retained the services of goldman  sachs co 
to assist us with our review 
on february   we signed a definitive agreement to sell all of the stock we own in the companies that make up our fresh cut segment to chiquita brands international  inc for a purchase price of million 
consummation of the sale is subject to the expiration of the waiting period under the hart scott rodino act and the satisfaction of other customary conditions to our and chiquita s obligation to close the transaction 
we expect net proceeds after taxes and expenses related to the transaction to be approximately million 
we expect to use approximately million from the net proceeds of the sale to repay all of our indebtedness  including estimated prepayment penalties 
the balance of these net proceeds will be used primarily for a return of capital to shareholders through share repurchases  cash dividends or some combination of the two 
we expect this will leave the company well positioned to pursue continued growth opportunities in the future 
effective in the first quarter of  we will classify the assets and liabilities of the fresh cut segment as discontinued operations and will report the results of operations for fresh cut in discontinued operations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no

the rd week contributed approximately million  or  to broadline net sales growth 
in and  we continued to increase sales to independent restaurants and generated incremental sales to existing customers and markets 
we refer to independent restaurants serviced by our sales representatives as street customers 
street customers tend to use more of our proprietary brands and value added services  resulting in higher margin sales 
we continued to increase sales of our proprietary brands  which typically generate higher margins than national brands 
sales of our proprietary brands represented of street sales in  compared to in and in in  we also continued to increase sales and sales per delivery at quality foods  inc  one of our broadline companies that we acquired in may  and we continued to increase our sales of center of the plate items  including beef  poultry  seafood and other proteins 
we believe that selling more center of the plate items positions us favorably with our customers 
we discontinued service to certain wendy s quick service restaurant locations in the first quarter of our annual sales to these wendy s locations totaled million 
however  we rolled out new multi unit chain business during the first and early second quarters of  which we expect to generate approximately million of annualized sales 
in 
table of contents the third and fourth quarters of  we rolled out additional new multi unit chain business  which is expected to result in approximately million of annualized net sales 
we incurred incremental costs in related to this new business 
broadline acquisition net sales growth in resulted mainly from our acquisitions of quality foods in may  and middendorf meat company and thoms proestler company and tpc logistics  inc  collectively tpc  in july these acquisitions are discussed below in business combinations

customized net sales represented  and of our consolidated net sales in  and  respectively

fresh cut 
in  fresh cut net sales increased million  or  over in  fresh cut net sales increased million  or  over all of our and net sales growth was from existing operations 
we estimate that food product inflation contributed approximately to fresh cut net sales growth in both and the rd week contributed approximately million  or  to fresh cut net sales growth 
in  fresh cut net sales grew mainly due to higher sales volumes to retail customers 
while retail sales continued to grow  the rate of growth in the retail packaged salad category industry wide slowed compared to historical levels  which negatively impacted sales growth 
in  fresh cut net sales grew because of increased sales volume to foodservice and retail customers and favorable changes in product mix towards higher value added products 
the increase in sales volume is due mainly to increased sales of tender leaf premium salad products to quick service restaurants and retail customers 
the tender leaf products for retail customers and premium salads for foodservice operators sell at a higher price per pound than products consisting mainly of iceberg lettuce 
fresh cut segment net sales represented  and of our consolidated net sales in  and  respectively

cost of goods sold in  cost of goods sold increased million  or  to billion 
in  cost of goods sold increased million  or  to billion from billion in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales  or the cost of goods sold ratio  was in  in and in the increase in the cost of goods sold ratio in compared to and compared to is due to the factors discussed below 
broadline 
our broadline segment s cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales in increased compared to broadline s cost of goods sold ratio increased due to a higher mix of center of the plate items  which we believe positions us favorably with our customers and due to increased sales to multi unit customers  which carry a lower gross margin percentage than sales to street customers 
center of the plate items typically have a lower gross margin percentage than other products  due to their higher cost per case and are usually sold on a cost per pound basis rather than a percentage markup 
products in the meat category have been particularly affected by inflation in although a higher sales mix of 
table of contents center of the plate items can result in a lower gross margin  our strength in this category is an important part of our strategy to grow our higher margin street sales 
additionally  quality foods  one of our broadline companies  which we acquired in may  has experienced erosion in its cost of goods sold ratio due to a shift in sales mix 
we expect the impact of this trend at the quality foods locations  which includes pfg little rock  pfg magee  and pfg batesville  to continue into at a reduced rate 
reducing cost of goods sold in the broadline segment in was million of additional insurance proceeds received in the fourth quarter of  related to the springfield foodservice ammonia leak 
in july  we discovered an ammonia leak in the refrigeration system at our springfield foodservice facility in massachusetts 
although there were no injuries and the leak was confined to the facility  the leak did cause physical damage at the facility and negatively affected the sales and operating profit of our broadline segment 
in  broadline s cost of goods sold included million related to damaged inventory  net of million of insurance coverage  attributable to the ammonia leak 
customized 
our customized segment s cost of goods sold ratio increased in from due mainly to food product inflation 
although the higher food cost was passed on to customers and did not negatively impact the customized segment s gross profit dollars  it resulted in lower gross profit as a percentage of net sales 
our customized segment s cost of goods sold ratio declined in compared to as a result of changes in pricing  product mix and customer mix 
fresh cut 
our fresh cut segment s cost of goods sold ratio increased in compared to because of several factors 
our long term plan had been to rationalize some of fresh cut s non value added foodservice business 
however  the transition moved at a faster pace than planned and the loss of sales from certain foodservice customers who exited during  including competitors of performance food group s distribution business  contributed to the increase in the cost of goods sold ratio 
we will continue to experience a higher cost of goods sold ratio until we can adjust our cost structure to reflect this loss of foodservice revenue 
in  we rolled out new fruit products to certain customers more quickly than planned and incurred certain start up inefficiencies  which also increased our cost of goods sold ratio 
in addition  increased production overhead  including depreciation  repairs and maintenance and insurance related costs  negatively impacted our cost of goods sold ratio 
fresh cut s cost of goods sold ratio increased in compared to related to the growth of our tender leaf premium salad products and increased lettuce costs 
the unexpected  rapid growth in sales of our tender leaf salad products in  discussed in net sales  created inefficiencies in our processing and warehousing activities due to the slower speeds of the tender leaf processing equipment  and the related physical capacity consumed by these processing lines 
during the second quarter of  the cost of lettuce was affected by industry wide increased demand from quick service restaurants for new premium salad products supplied by our fresh cut segment 
this level of demand was not anticipated when growers made their planting decisions  which resulted in a significant increase in market prices for lettuce 
while we routinely contract for the vast majority of our lettuce needs  the success of these products meant that we had to make additional market purchases at higher prices to satisfy increased customer demand 
we were able to recoup some  but not all  of these higher costs from increased pricing to our customers 
also during  the industry experienced raw material supply disruptions caused by abnormal weather conditions during the crop growing cycle 
in a continuing effort to maintain supplies to meet customer demand for our products  we made additional market purchases at substantially higher than historical prices  with the intention of recouping these higher costs by increasing prices to our customers 
when market prices of raw products unexpectedly declined sharply in late december  we were unable to recoup all of these higher costs through continued price increases to our customers

selling expenses also increased in fresh cut due to increased promotional spending 
broadline s operating expenses were affected by incremental start up costs related to new multi unit business 
we were able to offset these increased costs in broadline with improved operating efficiencies 

table of contents the decrease in the operating expense ratio in compared to was due mainly to improvements in our broadline segment and decreased overhead costs in our fresh cut segment  discussed below 
these improvements were partially offset by increased estimated workers compensation and vehicle liability insurance costs in all of our business segments and increased operating expenses in our customized segment related to the labor dispute discussed below 
broadline 
our broadline segment s operating expense ratio declined in from because of improved warehouse efficiencies  partially offset by higher fuel and insurance costs and start up costs related to the new multi chain business discussed in net sales

in  operating expenses included million of costs attributable to the ammonia leak at springfield foodservice  discussed above in cost of goods sold 
customized 
our customized segment s operating expense ratio declined in compared to due primarily to the effects of food product inflation on net sales 
these declines were partially offset by higher fuel and insurance costs 
in the fourth quarter of  certain drivers at the elkton  maryland facility went on strike 
we incurred incremental costs in both and to engage replacement drivers to maintain the service level to our customers  to provide additional security at the facility  and to pay our legal counsel 
in the third quarter of  we received a petition from a majority of our drivers in elkton  maryland  stating that they no longer wished to be represented by the union 
accordingly  we were legally obligated to withdraw recognition of the union 
incremental costs resulting from the elkton labor dispute declined throughout our customized segment s operating expense ratio increased slightly in from  mainly due to increased estimated workers compensation and vehicle liability self insurance costs and costs related to the labor dispute at our elkton  maryland distribution facility 
fresh cut 
our fresh cut segment s operating expense ratio increased in from mainly because of increased operating expenses compounded by the loss of foodservice revenue 
a major initiative continues to be optimizing our logistics infrastructure as we continue this transition 
see cost of goods sold above 
in addition  selling expenses increased in due to higher promotional spending 
operating expenses also increased due to higher employee related expenses  insurance costs and legal and consulting fees 
our fresh cut segment s operating expense ratio declined in from mainly because of decreased overhead costs partially offset by increased estimated workers compensation and vehicle liability self insurance costs

in april  we also amended and restated the credit facility  which  among other things  increased the facility to million from million 
the credit facility expires in and bears interest at a floating rate equal to  at our election  the agent bank s prime rate or a spread over libor 
this rate varies based upon our senior leverage ratio  which excludes subordinated debt  and is defined in the credit agreement

the increases in checks in excess of deposits are related to higher inventory levels and timing of payments due to our efforts to improve cash management 
we believe that our cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit facility and the sale of undivided interests in receivables under our receivables facility  discussed below  will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future

as of january   the maximum potential earnout obligation  assuming all future earnout targets are met in their earliest possible years  totaled million  excluding approximately million accrued in related to an earnout settlement with the former owners of middendorf meat  all of which can be potentially earned in these contingent payments are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at january  
table of contents  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
if paid  these earnout payments would increase the goodwill of the companies acquired 
if the future earnout targets are not met  these maximum amounts will be lower  or we may not be required to make any payments 
we have entered into numerous operating leases  including leases of buildings  equipment  tractors and trailers 
in certain of these leases  we have provided residual value guarantees to the lessors 
circumstances that would require us to perform under the guarantees include either our default on the leases with the leased assets being sold for less than the specified residual values in the lease agreements  or our decision not to purchase the assets at the end of the lease terms combined with the sale of the assets  with sales proceeds less than the residual value of the leased assets specified in the lease agreements 
our residual value guarantees under these operating lease agreements typically range between and of the value of the leased assets at inception of the lease 
these leases have original terms ranging from one to nine years and expiration dates ranging from to at january   the undiscounted maximum amount of potential future payments under these guarantees totaled million  which would be mitigated by the fair value of the leased assets at lease expiration 
our assessment as to whether it is probable that we will be required to make payments under the terms of the guarantees is based upon our actual and expected loss experience 
consistent with the requirements of financial accounting standard board interpretation no 
 we have recorded  of the million of potential future payments under these guarantees on our consolidated balance sheet as of january  additionally  we do not consider payments under these guarantees  if any  reasonably likely to have a material impact on our future consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
note and to our consolidated financial statements provide further discussion of these guarantees and the related accounting and disclosure requirements 
off balance sheet activities we have a receivables facility  which is generally described as off balance sheet financing 
in addition  we had two master operating lease facilities  generally considered to be off balance sheet financing  which we terminated in june in financing activities above  we describe certain purchase obligations  earnout agreements with certain of the former owners of the businesses that we have acquired  and residual value guarantees  all of which could be considered off balance sheet items 
refer to the discussion in financing activities above and notes and to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our commitments  contingencies and leases 
the receivables facility represents off balance sheet financing because the transaction and the financial institution s ownership interest in certain of our accounts receivable results in assets being removed from our consolidated balance sheet to the extent that the transaction qualifies for sale treatment under generally accepted accounting principles 
this treatment requires us to account for the transaction with the financial institution as a sale of the undivided interest in the accounts receivable instead of reflecting the financial institution s net investment of million as debt 
we believe that the receivables facility provides us with additional liquidity at a very competitive cost compared to other forms of financing 
in july  we entered into the receivables facility  under which pfg receivables corporation  a wholly owned  special purpose subsidiary  sold an undivided interest in certain of our trade receivables 
pfg receivables corporation was formed for the sole purpose of buying receivables generated by certain of our operating units and selling an undivided interest in those receivables to a financial institution 
under the receivables facility  certain of our operating units sell a portion of their accounts receivable to pfg receivables corporation  which in turn  subject to certain conditions  may from time to time sell an undivided interest in these receivables to the financial institution 
our operating units continue to service the receivables on behalf of the financial institution at estimated market rates 
accordingly  we have not recognized a servicing asset or liability 
we received million of proceeds from the sale of the undivided interest in receivables under the receivables facility in in june  we increased the amount of the undivided interest in the receivables that can be owned by the financial institution to million 
in july  we sold an incremental undivided interest in receivables under the receivables facility and received an additional million in proceeds 
we used these proceeds to repay borrowings under our credit facility and to fund working capital needs 
on october   we sold another incremental undivided interest in receivables under the receivables facility and received an additional million in proceeds 
we used these proceeds to reduce amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
on june   we extended the term of the receivables facility to june  if the receivables facility terminates  either at its scheduled termination date or upon the occurrence of specified events similar to events of default  payments on accounts receivable sold would be remitted to the financial institution in an amount equal to the institution s undivided interest 
at january   securitized accounts receivable totaled million  including million sold to the financial institution and derecognized from our consolidated balance sheet 
total securitized accounts receivable includes our residual interest in accounts receivable of million 
the residual interest represents our retained interest in receivables held by pfg receivables corporation 
we measure the residual interest using the estimated discounted cash 
table of contents flows of the underlying accounts receivable  based on estimated collections and a discount rate approximately equivalent to our incremental borrowing rate 
losses on the sale of the undivided interest in receivables of million in and million in and are included in other expense  net  in our consolidated statements of earnings and represent our cost of securitizing those receivables with the financial institution 
we record the sale of the undivided interest in accounts receivable to the financial institution according to statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
accordingly  at the time the undivided interest in receivables is sold  the receivables are removed from our consolidated balance sheet 
we record a loss on the sale of the undivided interest in these receivables  which includes a discount  based upon the receivables credit quality and a financing cost for the financial institution  based upon a day commercial paper rate 
at january   the rate under the receivables facility was per annum in june  we terminated our two master operating lease facilities 
in june  the lessor sold two of the three distribution centers included in the first master operating lease facility the first facility to third parties unaffiliated with us 
we concurrently entered into operating leases with those unaffiliated third parties for these distribution centers 
the operating leases have initial terms of years  plus five renewal options of five years each 
the future minimum lease payments for these leases are included in the above table of contractual obligations 
in addition  we purchased the remaining distribution center in the first facility from the lessor for million 
this distribution center is recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at january  in our customized segment 
in june  the lessor sold one of the distribution centers and the office building included in our other master operating lease facility the second facility to third parties unaffiliated with us 
we also sold land and a building under construction to a third party unaffiliated with us 
we concurrently entered into operating leases with those unaffiliated third parties for all of these properties 
the operating leases have initial terms of years  plus five renewal options of five years each 
the future minimum lease payments for these leases are included in the above table of contractual obligations 
in addition  we purchased the remaining distribution center in the second facility from the lessor for million 
this distribution center is recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at january  in our broadline segment 
business combinations in  we paid million and issued approximately  shares of our common stock  net  valued at approximately  related to contractual obligations in the purchase agreements for all kitchens  which we acquired in  carroll county foods  which we acquired in  and other companies acquired 
we also accrued approximately million related to an earnout settlement with the former owners of middendorf meat  which we acquired in in  we paid million to the former shareholders of fresh express 
these payments were for certain contractual obligations and associated taxes related to the purchase agreement for fresh express  which we acquired in also in  we paid million and issued approximately  shares of our common stock  valued at approximately  related to contractual obligations in the purchase agreements for all kitchens  tpc  carroll county foods and other companies acquired 
we acquired all kitchens and tpc in we recorded these earnout payments as additional purchase price  with corresponding increases in goodwill 
in october  a wholly owned subsidiary of ours  known as progressive group alliance  acquired all of the assets of all kitchens  a privately owned procurement and merchandising firm based in boise  idaho 
all kitchens provides procurement and merchandising services to its distributors 
we believe that this acquisition increases our services to existing progressive group alliance and all kitchens distributors  and expands our geographic base of independent foodservice distributors 
we paid million in cash for all kitchens  and assumed million of trade payables and accrued expenses with the acquisition 
in connection with the acquisition  we will be required to pay the prior owner of the acquired assets up to million in cash  if certain affiliate distributor targets are achieved through september we will record and have recorded these earnout payments as additional price resulting in a corresponding increase in goodwill 
in july  we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of tpc  a privately owned  broadline foodservice distributor based in rock island  illinois 
tpc services customers located throughout the states of illinois  indiana  iowa and wisconsin  including the major metropolitan area of chicago 
we believe that our acquisition of tpc extends our broadline service area in the midwest region 
we paid million for the acquisition of tpc  consisting of million in cash and common stock valued at million 
the purchase price included the repayment of outstanding debt 
we also assumed million of trade payables and accrued expenses with the acquisition of tpc 
in recording the acquisition  we valued the approximately  common shares issued based on the measurement criteria in emerging issues task force issue no

table of contents in july  we also acquired all of the outstanding common stock of middendorf meat  a privately owned  broadline foodservice distributor based in st 
louis  missouri  through the merger of middendorf meat with a wholly owned subsidiary of ours 
middendorf meat distributes custom cut steaks and other foodservice items to independent restaurants  private clubs  hotels and other foodservice establishments in st 
louis and surrounding areas 
we believe that our acquisition of middendorf meat extends our service area to a region that is geographically contiguous to our other broadline businesses 
we paid million for the acquisition of middendorf meat  consisting of million in cash and common stock valued at million 
the purchase price included the repayment of a portion of middendorf meat s outstanding debt 
we also assumed million in trade payables  accrued expenses  deferred taxes and debt with the acquisition of middendorf meat 
in the second quarter of  we finalized the purchase price of middendorf meat  resulting in the return of million in cash and million in our common stock from the former owners of middendorf meat  related to the closing net worth adjustment and certain related claims 
we recorded this adjustment to the purchase price as a reduction of goodwill 
in recording the acquisition  we valued the approximately  common shares issued  net  based on the measurement criteria of eitf no 
in may  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of quality foods  a privately owned  broadline foodservice distributor based in little rock  arkansas  with distribution centers in little rock  and batesville and magee  mississippi 
quality foods provides products and services to traditional foodservice accounts in a region covering arkansas  louisiana  mississippi  missouri  oklahoma  tennessee and texas 
we believe that our acquisition of quality foods extends our service area to a region that is geographically contiguous to our other broadline businesses 
we paid million  net of cash acquired  for quality foods 
the purchase price included the repayment of outstanding debt 
we also assumed million of trade payables and accrued expenses with the acquisition of quality foods 
in connection with the acquisition  we entered into an earnout agreement whereby we will be required to pay the former shareholders of quality foods up to million in cash if quality foods achieves certain targeted levels of growth in operating profit  as defined  over a three year period following the acquisition 
we will record any earnout payments as additional purchase price  resulting in a corresponding increase in goodwill 
also in  we paid a total of million in cash and issued approximately  shares of our common stock  valued at approximately  to the former shareholders of carroll county foods and afflink  which were acquired in and  respectively  as a result of certain contractual obligations in the purchase agreements relating to those acquisitions 
we have recorded these earnout payments as additional purchase price  resulting in corresponding increases in goodwill 
application of critical accounting policies we have prepared our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis 
in preparing our financial statements  management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting periods 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex  consequently  actual results could differ from those estimates 
we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates we use to prepare our financial statements 
management s estimates are generally based upon historical experience and various other assumptions that we determine to be reasonable in light of the relevant facts and circumstances 
we believe that our critical accounting estimates include goodwill and other intangible assets  allowance for doubtful accounts  our insurance program  reserve for inventories  sales incentives  vendor rebates and other promotional incentives and income taxes 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
our goodwill and other intangible assets include the cost of acquired subsidiaries in excess of the fair value of the tangible net assets recorded in connection with acquisitions 
other intangible assets include customer relationships  trade names  trademarks  patents and non compete agreements 
we use estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  assigning lives to acquired intangibles and evaluating those assets for impairment after acquisition 
these estimates and assumptions include indicators that would trigger an impairment of assets  whether those indicators are temporary  economic or competitive factors that affect valuation  discount rates and cash flow estimates 
when we determine that the carrying value of such assets is not recoverable  or the estimated lives assigned to such assets are improper  we must reduce the carrying value of the assets to the net realizable value or adjust the amortization period of the asset  recording any adjustment in our consolidated statements of earnings 
as of january   our unamortized goodwill was million and other intangible assets totaled million  net 
sfas no 
was effective at the beginning of  except for goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from business combinations completed subsequent to june   for which the standard was effective beginning july  in accordance with sfas no 
 we ceased amortizing goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives as of the beginning of sfas no 
requires us to assess goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually in the absence of an indicator of possible impairment and immediately upon an indicator of possible 
table of contents impairment 
sfas no 
requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units and our intangible assets with indefinite lives 
if we determine that the fair values of our reporting units are less than the carrying amount of goodwill  we must recognize an impairment loss in our financial statements 
to perform the assessment of significant other non amortized intangible assets  we compare the book value of the asset to the discounted expected future operating cash flows generated by the specific asset 
if we determine the discounted future operating cash flows are less than the recorded values of other unamortized assets  we must recognize an impairment loss in our financial statements 
annually  we are also required to evaluate the remaining useful life of intangible assets that are not being amortized to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for our broadline and fresh cut segments  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
our customized segment has no goodwill or other intangible assets 
in  and  we recorded no impairment loss based on these assessments 
in testing for potential impairment  we measured the estimated fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets with indefinite lives based upon discounting future operating cash flows using an appropriate discount rate 
a change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows or discount rate used in our calculation of the fair value of the reporting units would have no impact on the reported value of our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives on our consolidated balance sheet as of january  we report intangible assets with definite lives at cost less accumulated amortization 
we compute amortization over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets  generally three to forty years 
we test these intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a particular asset may not be recoverable  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in order to evaluate the recoverability of an asset  we compare the carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if we determine that the estimated  undiscounted future cash flows of the asset are less than its carrying amount on our consolidated balance sheet  we must record an impairment loss in our financial statements 
in  and  we recorded no impairment loss for intangible assets with definite lives 
due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions related to the valuation of the reporting units and intangible assets with definite lives  and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty 
therefore  as we become aware of additional information  we may change our estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
we regularly analyze our significant customer accounts  and when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  we record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount we reasonably believe is collectible 
we also record reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors  including the length of time the receivables are past due  the financial health of the customer  macroeconomic considerations and historical experience 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  we may need to adjust our estimates of the recoverability of receivables 
in  and  we wrote off uncollectible accounts receivable of million  million and million  respectively  against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in  and  we recorded estimates of million  million and million  respectively  in operating expenses to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
insurance program 
we maintain a self insurance program covering portions of our general and vehicle liability  workers compensation and group medical insurance 
the amounts in excess of the self insured levels are fully insured by third parties  subject to certain limitations and exclusions 
the company utilizes a third party actuary to assist in the calculation of these reserves 
we accrue an estimated liability for these self insured programs  including an estimate for incurred but not reported claims  based on known claims and past claims history 
these accruals are included in accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheets 
the provisions for insurance claims include estimates of the frequency and timing of claim occurrences  as well as the ultimate amounts to be paid 
the accounting estimate of the self insurance liability includes both known and incurred but not reported insurance claims 
this estimate is highly susceptible to change from period to period if claims differ from past claims history  which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
if we experience claims in excess of our estimates by  our insurance expense and related insurance liability would increase by million  negatively affecting our consolidated financial statements 
reserve for inventories 
we maintain reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories 
these reserves are based upon inventory category  inventory age  specifically identified inventory items and overall economic conditions 
a sudden and unexpected change in consumer preferences could result in a significant change in the reserve balance and a corresponding charge to earnings 

table of contents sales incentives 
we  primarily through our fresh cut segment  offer sales incentives and promotions to our customers resellers and to consumers 
these incentives primarily include volume and growth rebates  exclusivity and placement fees fees paid to retailers for product display  consumer coupons and promotional discounts 
we follow the requirements of eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
consideration given to customers and consumers related to sales incentives is recorded as a reduction of sales 
we treat changes in the estimated amount of incentives to be paid as changes in estimates and recognize them in the period of change 
we systematically and rationally allocate the cost of volume and growth rebates and exclusivity and placement fees to each of the underlying revenue transactions that resulted in progress by the customer toward earning the incentives 
if we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of future incentives  we record the maximum potential amount 
we use a customer s prior purchasing volume and other factors to assist us in estimating the total incentives to be paid  if any 
we record promotional discounts primarily as a reduction to the customer s invoice for goods purchased based on an underlying agreement with the customer 
we record the cost of consumer coupons at the later of the date that we offer the coupon or the date we recognize the related revenue 
in recording coupon expense  we estimate the amount of refunds or rebates that will be redeemed by consumers 
we primarily use historical coupon redemption data and forecasted sales volumes to estimate the amount to be redeemed 
if we cannot reasonably and reliably estimate this amount  we record the maximum potential amount 
we believe that the estimates we have recorded for volume and growth rebates  exclusivity and placement fees and coupon allowances are reasonable and appropriate  based on facts and circumstances known at the time we recorded the estimates 
a significant change in customer purchase volumes  coupon redemption rates or consumer purchase volumes  among other factors  could result in a significant change in our net sales and earnings 
vendor rebates and other promotional incentives 
we participate in various rebate and promotional incentives with our suppliers  including volume and growth rebates  annual and multi year incentives and promotional programs 
in accounting for vendor rebates  we follow the guidance in eitf no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor and eitf no 
 application of issue no 
by resellers to sales incentives offered to consumers by manufacturers 
we generally record consideration received under these incentives as a reduction of cost of goods sold 
however  in certain circumstances  we record the consideration as a reduction of costs that we incur 
we may receive consideration in the form of cash and or invoice deductions 
we treat changes in the estimated amount of incentives to be received as changes in estimates and recognize them in the period of change 
we record consideration that we receive for incentives containing volume and growth rebates and annual and multi year incentives as a reduction of cost of goods sold 
we systematically and rationally allocate the consideration for these incentives to each of the underlying transactions that results in progress by us toward earning the incentives 
if the incentives are not probable and reasonably estimable  we record the incentives as the underlying objectives or milestones are achieved 
we record annual and multi year incentives when we earn them  generally over the agreement period 
we estimate whether we will achieve the underlying objectives or milestones using current and historical purchasing data  forecasted purchasing volumes and other factors 
we record consideration received to promote and sell the supplier s products as a reduction of our costs  as the consideration is typically a reimbursement of costs incurred by us 
if we receive consideration from the suppliers in excess of our costs  we record any excess as a reduction of cost of goods sold 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we must make judgments in determining our provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of business  many transactions occur for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain at the time of the transaction 
we adjust our income tax provision in the period in which we determine that it is probable that our actual results will differ from our estimates 
tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted 
at january  and january   we had million and million  respectively  of deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carry forwards for state income tax purposes 
the net operating loss carryforwards at january  expire in years through additionally  at january   we had certain state income tax credit carryforwards  which expire in years through our realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income 
we evaluate the need to record valuation allowances that would reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
when assessing the need for valuation allowances  we project future taxable income and consider prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the 
table of contents reliability of deferred tax assets in future years  we would record valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs  along with a corresponding charge to net earnings 
based on our evaluation  we recorded an allowance that is adequate to reduce the total deferred tax asset to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the above disclosure 
our financial statements contain other items that require estimation  but are not as critical as those discussed above 
these include our calculations for bonus accruals  depreciation and amortization 
changes in estimates and assumptions used in these and other items could have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
requires that handling costs and waste material spoilage be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the previous requirement of being abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires that allocations of fixed overhead to the cost of inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no

expense is to be recognized over the period during which employees are required to provide service 
sfas no

in addition  sfas no 
r amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows  to require that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as operating cash flows 
we will adopt the modified prospective application provisions of sfas no 
r in our third quarter of we anticipate the adoption will have a material impact on our results of operations 
based upon options outstanding as of january   and after the effect of the compensation committee of the board of directors decision to accelerate the vesting of certain options see below  we estimate stock option expense after the adoption of sfas r will be approximately  for the six months ended december    in   in   in and  thereafter  in each case net of tax 
these estimated expense amounts include options related to our fresh cut segment 
as previously discussed  we have signed a definitive agreement to sell our fresh cut segment 
assuming this transaction closes in the second quarter of as anticipated  our future stock compensation expense after the adoption of sfas r will be significantly reduced 
our future estimated expense excluding options held by our fresh cut associates is estimated to be approximately  for the six months ended december    for each year ended  and and  thereafter  in each case net of tax 
this does not include anticipated costs associated with any options that might be granted subsequent to january  subsequent events on february   we signed a definitive agreement to sell all of the stock we own in the companies that make up our fresh cut segment to chiquita brands international  inc for a purchase price of million 
consummation of the sale is subject to expiration of the waiting period under the hart scott rodino act and the satisfaction of other customary conditions to our and chiquita s obligation to close the transaction 
we expect net proceeds after taxes and expenses related to the transaction to be approximately million 
we expect to use approximately million from the net proceeds of the sale to repay all of our indebtedness  including estimated prepayment penalties 
the balance of these net proceeds will be used primarily for a return of capital to shareholders through share repurchases  cash dividends or some combination of the two 
effective in the first quarter of  we will classify the assets and liabilities of the fresh cut segment as discontinued operations and will report the results of operations for fresh cut in discontinued operations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
on february   we acting through the compensation committee of the board of directors accelerated the vesting of certain unvested options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock held by certain employees and officers under our employee stock incentive plan and equity incentive plan which had exercise prices greater than the closing price of the our common stock on february  these options became exercisable immediately as a result of the vesting acceleration 
we currently account for stock options under the provisions of apb no 
and related interpretations which do not require any compensation expense to be recorded for modification of stock options if  at the date of modification  the exercise price is greater than the market price 
as such  we will not record any compensation expense as a result of this acceleration 

table of contents quarterly results and seasonality set forth below is certain summary information with respect to our operations for the most recent eight fiscal quarters 
all of the fiscal quarters set forth below had weeks  except for the fourth quarter of  which had weeks 
historically  the restaurant and food service business is seasonal  with lower sales in the first quarter 
consequently  we may experience lower net sales during the first quarter  depending on the timing of any future acquisitions 
management believes our quarterly net sales will continue to be impacted by the seasonality of the restaurant business 
in addition  our fresh cut segment experiences some seasonality  primarily due to changes in raw material costs  as product is grown in different regions of the country in certain times of the year

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risks are related to fluctuations in interest rate and changes in commodity prices 
our primary interest rate risk is from changing interest rates related to our outstanding debt 
we currently manage this risk through a combination of fixed and floating rates on these obligations 
as of january   our total debt consisted of fixed and floating rate debt of million and million  respectively 
as of january   our total debt consisted of fixed and floating rate debt of million and million  respectively 
in addition  our receivables facility has a floating rate 
substantially all of our floating rates are based on libor with the exception of the rate on the receivables facility  which is based upon a day commercial paper rate 
a basis point increase in market interest rates on all of our floating rate debt and our receivables facility would result in a decrease in net earnings and cash flows of approximately million per annum  holding other variables constant 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt and receivables facility  respectively 
significant commodity price fluctuations for certain commodities that we purchase  particularly for lettuce  could have a material impact on our results of operations 
in an attempt to manage our commodity price risk  our fresh cut segment  in the normal course of business  enters into contracts to purchase pre established quantities of various types of produce  particularly lettuce  at contracted prices based on our expected needs 
to a lesser extent  our broadline segment also enters into contracts to purchase pre established quantities of products in the normal course of business 
commitments that we have entered into to purchase produce and other products in our fresh cut and broadline segments as of january   are included in the table of contractual obligations in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financing activities in this form k 
in the case of produce  in the event that the amount of produce that we have contracted to purchase is not sufficient to meet our needs  either because of unexpected demand for our products  or as a result of disruptions in supply for instance  due to weather or disease  we will be required to purchase additional produce to meet our needs on the open market at prices that 
table of contents may be significantly higher than our contracted prices 
alternatively  we may need to enter into contracts to meet our forecasted needs during times of elevated market prices 
if the market prices subsequently decline  we are still required to pay the contracted price for the contracted amounts of produce
