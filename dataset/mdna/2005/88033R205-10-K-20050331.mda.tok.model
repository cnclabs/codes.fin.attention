item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation liquidity and capital resources 
in addition  there are several capital development projects that the company has considered to increase current oil production with respect to the kansas properties  including recompletion of wells and major workovers 
management has made the decision to undertake as many of these projects as may be paid from current cash flow  as the company does not presently have the necessary funds to perform all workovers simultaneously 
to date  a limited number of workovers on the company s oil wells in kansas has been successful 
the workovers included a treatment of wells by injection of polymers a type of plastic compound that has sealed off almost all of the water from entering the fluid stream that is naturally produced from the wells  while at the same time increasing the total quantity of crude oil that is actually produced per day from the treated wells 
although there can be no assurances  similar workovers when completed might reduce water production and its associated removal expense and increase oil production in kansas from many of the company s other existing oil wells 
the company s gas producing properties in kansas were physically separated from the oil properties  and were all located in rush county  kansas 
the company believes that there is a limited possibility of significant additional net revenues being obtained by the company from these properties 
consequently  on march  the company sold fifty three producing gas wells and saltwater disposal wells and the associated gathering system as well as the underlying leases and rights of way constituting all of the gas wells  leases and gathering systems in rush county  kansas that were purchased by the company from afg in to bear petroleum  inc for million 
as a result  the company s kansas properties now consist exclusively of oil producing properties 
other areas of development the company has evaluated other geological structures in the east tennessee area that are similar to the swan creek field 
these target evaluations were made using any available third party seismic data  the company s own seismic investigations  and drilling results and geophysical logs from the existing wells in the region 
while these areas are of interest  and may be further evaluated at some future time  based on its review to date the company does not currently intend to actively explore these areas with its own funds 
however  the company may consider entering into partnerships where further exploration and drilling costs can be largely borne by third parties 
there can be no assurances that any third party would participate in a drilling program in these structures  that any of these prospects will be drilled  and if they were drilled that they would result in commercial production 
the company is seeking to purchase and has attempted to acquire additional existing oil and gas production in the mid continent usa area 
the company is particularly interested in areas of kansas  oklahoma  and texas 
although financing plans are uncertain  management believes that when a suitable property becomes available  a combination of such a property when combined with our current reserves would allow the company to create a financing mechanism that would make a purchase of the property possible 
however  there is no assurance that a suitable property will become available or that terms will be established leading to a completion of such a purchase 
the company also intends to establish and explore all business opportunities for connection of the pipeline system owned by the company s subsidiary  tpc  to other sources of natural gas so that revenues from third parties for transportation of gas across the pipeline system may be generated 
although no assurances can be made  such connections may also enable the company to purchase natural gas from other sources and to then market natural gas to new customers in the kingsport  tennessee area at retail rates under a franchise agreement already granted to the company by the city of kingsport  subject to approval by the tennessee regulatory authority 
the company also intends to explore the feasibility of obtaining natural gas or substitutes for natural gas from unconventional sources if such gas can be economically treated and tendered in commercial volumes for transportation through the company s existing pipeline system or other delivery mechanisms for the purposes of supplementing the company s existing supply to existing customers  and sale to additional customers 
governmental regulations the company is subject to numerous state and federal regulations  environmental and otherwise  that may have a substantial negative effect on its ability to operate at a profit 
for a discussion of the risks involved as a result of such regulations  see  effect of existing or probable governmental regulations on business and costs and effects of compliance with environmental laws hereinafter in this section 
principal products or services and markets the principal markets for the company s crude oil are local refining companies  local utilities and private industry end users 
the principal markets for the company s natural gas are local utilities  private industry end users  and natural gas marketing companies 
gas production from the swan creek field can presently be delivered through the company s completed pipeline to the powell valley utility district in hancock county  eastman and bae in sullivan county  as well as other industrial customers in the kingsport area 
the company has acquired all necessary regulatory approvals and necessary property rights for the pipeline system 
the company s pipeline can not only provide transportation service for gas produced from the company s wells  but could provide transportation of gas for small independent producers in the local area as well 
the company could  although there can be no assurance  sell its products to certain local towns  industries and utility districts 
natural gas from the kansas properties is delivered to oneok bushton processing  inc in bushton  kansas 
at present  crude oil is sold to the national cooperative refining association in mcpherson  kansas  miles from hays 
national cooperative is solely responsible for transportation of the oil it purchases whether by truck or pipeline 
drilling equipment on july  the company sold an ingersoll rand rd drilling rig and related equipment 
the company does not currently own a drilling rig or any related drilling equipment 
the company obtains drilling services as required from time to time from various companies as available in the swan creek field area and various drilling contractors in kansas 
distribution methods of products or services crude oil is normally delivered to refineries in tennessee and kansas by tank truck and natural gas is distributed and transported via pipeline 
competitive business conditions  competitive position in the industry and methods of competition the company s contemplated oil and gas exploration activities in the states of tennessee and kansas will be undertaken in a highly competitive and speculative business atmosphere 
in seeking any other suitable oil and gas properties for acquisition  the company will be competing with a number of other companies  including large oil and gas companies and other independent operators with greater financial resources 
management does not believe that the company s initial competitive position in the oil and gas industry will be significant 
the company s principal competitors in the state of tennessee are nami resources  llc  miller petroleum  inc and knox energy development 
nami resources  miller petroleum  and knox energy development are in the business of exploring for and producing oil and natural gas in the kentucky and east tennessee areas 
these companies are in competition with the company for lease positions in the known producing areas in which the company currently operates  as well as other potential areas of interest 
there are numerous producers in the area of the kansas properties 
some are larger with greater financial resources 
although management does not foresee any difficulties in procuring contracted drilling rigs  several factors  including increased competition in the area  may limit the availability of drilling rigs  rig operators and related personnel and or equipment in the future 
such limitations would have a natural adverse impact on the profitability of the company s operations 
the company anticipates no difficulty in procuring well drilling permits in any state 
they are usually issued within one week of application 
the company generally does not apply for a permit until it is actually ready to commence drilling operations 
the prices of the company s products are controlled by the world oil market and the united states natural gas market 
thus  competitive pricing behaviors are considered unlikely  however  competition in the oil and gas exploration industry exists in the form of competition to acquire the most promising acreage blocks and obtaining the most favorable prices for transporting the product 
sources and availability of raw materials excluding the development of oil and gas reserves and the production of oil and gas  the company s operations are not dependent on the acquisition of any raw materials 
dependence on one or a few major customers the company is presently dependent upon a small number of customers for the sale of gas from the swan creek field  principally eastman and bae  and other industrial customers in the kingsport area with which the company may enter into gas sales contracts 
natural gas from the kansas properties is delivered to kansas nebraska energy  inc in bushton  kansas 
at present  crude oil from the kansas properties is being trucked and transported through pipelines to the national cooperative refining association in mcpherson  kansas  miles from hays  kansas 
national cooperative is solely responsible for transportation of products whether by truck or pipeline 
patents  trademarks  licenses  franchises  concessions  royalty agreements or labor contracts  including duration royalty agreements relating to oil and gas production are standard in the industry 
the amount of the company s royalty payments varies from lease to lease 
need for governmental approval of principal products or services none of the principal products offered by the company require governmental approval  although permits are required for drilling oil or gas wells 
in addition the transportation service offered by tpc is subject to regulation by the tennessee regulatory authority to the extent of certain construction  safety  tariff rates and charges  and nondiscrimination requirements under state law 
these requirements are typical of those imposed on regulated common carriers or utilities in the state of tennessee 
tpc presently has all required approvals necessary to transport natural gas to all customers of the company 
the city of kingsport  tennessee has also enacted an ordinance granting to tpc a franchise for twenty years to construct  maintain and operate a gas system to import  transport  and sell natural gas to the city of kingsport and its inhabitants  institutions and businesses for domestic  commercial  industrial and institutional uses 
this ordinance and the franchise agreement it authorizes also require approval of the tennessee regulatory authority under state law 
the company will not initiate the required approval process for the ordinance and franchise agreement until such time that it can supply gas to the city of kingsport 
although the company anticipates that regulatory approval would be granted  there can be no assurances that it would be granted  or that such approval would be granted in a timely manner  or that such approval would not be limited in some manner by the tennessee regulatory authority 
tpc presently has all required tariffs and approvals necessary to transport natural gas to all customers of the company 
effect of existing or probable governmental regulations on business exploration and production activities relating to oil and gas leases are subject to numerous environmental laws  rules and regulations 
the federal clean water act requires the company to construct a fresh water containment barrier between the surface of each drilling site and the underlying water table 
this involves the insertion of a seven inch diameter steel casing into each well  with cement on the outside of the casing 
the company has fully complied with this environmental regulation  the cost of which is approximately  per well 
the state of tennessee also requires the posting of a bond to ensure that the company s wells are properly plugged when abandoned 
a separate  bond is required for each well drilled 
the company currently has the requisite amount of bonds on deposit 
as part of the company s purchase of the kansas properties it acquired a statewide permit to drill in kansas 
applications under such permit are applied for and issued within one to two weeks prior to drilling 
at the present time  the state of kansas does not require the posting of a bond either for permitting or to insure that the company s wells are properly plugged when abandoned 
all of the wells in the kansas properties have all permits required and the company believes that it is in compliance with the laws of the state of kansas 
the company s exploration  production and marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal  state and local levels 
the company has made and will continue to make expenditures in its efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental and other regulations 
further  the oil and gas regulatory environment could change in ways that might substantially increase these costs 
hydrocarbon producing states regulate conservation practices and the protection of correlative rights 
these regulations affect the company s operations and limit the quantity of hydrocarbons it may produce and sell 
in addition  at the federal level  the federal energy regulatory commission regulates interstate transportation of natural gas under the natural gas act 
other regulated matters include marketing  pricing  transportation and valuation of royalty payments 
the company s operations are also subject to numerous and frequently changing laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
the company owns or leases  and has in the past owned or leased  properties that have been used for the exploration and production of oil and gas and these properties and the wastes disposed on these properties may be subject to the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  the oil pollution act of  the resource conservation and recovery act  the federal water pollution control act and analogous state laws 
under such laws  the company could be required to remove or remediate previously released wastes or property contamination 
laws and regulations protecting the environment have generally become more stringent and  may in some cases  impose strict liability for environmental damage 
strict liability means that the company may be held liable for damage without regard to whether it was negligent or otherwise at fault 
environmental laws and regulations may expose the company to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the imposition of administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
while management believes that the company s operations are in substantial compliance with existing requirements of governmental bodies  the company s ability to conduct continued operations is subject to satisfying applicable regulatory and permitting controls 
the company s current permits and authorizations and ability to get future permits and authorizations may be susceptible  on a going forward basis  to increased scrutiny  greater complexity resulting in increased costs or delays in receiving appropriate authorizations 
the company s board of directors has adopted resolutions to form an environmental response policy and emergency action response policy program 
a plan was adopted which provides for the erection of signs at each well and at strategic locations along the pipeline containing telephone numbers of the company s office and the home telephone numbers of key personnel 
a list is maintained at the company s office and at the home of key personnel listing phone numbers for fire  police  emergency services and company employees who will be needed to deal with emergencies 
the foregoing is only a brief summary of some of the existing environmental laws  rules and regulations to which the company s business operations are subject  and there are many others  the effects of which could have an adverse impact on the company 
future legislation in this area will no doubt be enacted and revisions will be made in current laws 
no assurance can be given as to what effect these present and future laws  rules and regulations will have on the company s current and future operations 
research and development the company has not expended any material amount in research and development activities during the last two fiscal years 
number of total employees and number of full time employees the company presently has twenty four full time employees and no part time employees 
risk factors in addition to the other information in this document  investors in the company s common stock should consider carefully the following risks with respect to the company s business operations the company s auditors have issued their audit report  which includes an explanatory paragraph emphasizing substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the balance sheet date december  
management has disclosed in the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   certain circumstances that raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern  which depends upon the company s ability to obtain long term financing or raise capital to satisfy the company s cash flow requirements 
the company must make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas reserves 
historically  the company has paid for these expenditures with cash from operating activities  proceeds from debt and equity financings and asset sales 
the company s ability to re work existing wells  drill new wells and acquire new properties is dependent upon the company s ability to fund these expenditures 
although the company anticipated that after the resolution of its dispute with its primary lender  bank one  it would be able to find alternative institutional sources of financing for its activities  to date it has been unable to do so 
the company s inability to obtain a replacement credit facility to fund its operations combined with the fact that the company is still in the early stages of its oil and gas operating history  during which time it has a history of losses from operations and has an accumulated deficit of  and a working capital deficit of  as of december   the company s independent registered public accounting firm issued their report which emphasized the substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern as described above 
at the present time and if and until the company is able to obtain institutional financing  the company must obtain the necessary funds to proceed with the company s operations from other sources  such as equity investments or joint ventures with other companies 
in addition  the company s revenues or cash flows could decline in the future because of a variety of reasons  including lower oil and gas prices or the inoperability of some or all of the company s existing wells 
if the company s revenues or cash flows decrease or the company is unable to procure additional financing  the company would be required to reduce production over time or would otherwise be adversely affected  which would adversely impact the company s ability to continue in business 
where the company is not the majority owner or operator of an oil and gas project  the company may have no control over the timing or amount of capital expenditures required with the particular project 
if the company cannot fund the company s capital expenditures in such projects  the company s interests in such projects may be reduced or forfeited 
in addition to the company s operational cash requirements  the company has a significant amount of loans and other obligations either due or maturing may  as a result of the sale of the gas producing properties in kansas  the company was able to reduce amounts owed on high interest debts 
as of the filing date of this report  the company s remaining interest bearing loans have an aggregate principal amount of approximately  the company also has accrued and unpaid dividends on preferred stock in an aggregate amount in excess of  see below  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation liquidity and capital resources 
the company can make no assurances that it will be able to obtain any additional funding required as described above  in which event it may not be able to continue as a going concern 
declines in oil and gas prices will materially adversely affect the company 
the company s future financial condition and results of operations will depend in part upon the prices obtainable for the company s oil and natural gas production and the costs of finding  acquiring  developing and producing reserves 
prices for oil and natural gas are subject to fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond the company s control 
these factors include worldwide political instability especially in the middle east and other oil producing regions  the foreign supply of oil and gas  the price of foreign imports  the level of drilling activity  the level of consumer product demand  government regulations and taxes  the price and availability of alternative fuels and the overall economic environment 
a substantial or extended decline in oil and gas prices would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  quantities of oil and gas that may be economically produced  and access to capital 
oil and natural gas prices have historically been and are likely to continue to be volatile 
this volatility makes it difficult to estimate with precision the value of producing properties in acquisitions and to budget and project the return on exploration and development projects involving the company s oil and gas properties 
in addition  unusually volatile prices often disrupt the market for oil and gas properties  as buyers and sellers have more difficulty agreeing on the purchase price of properties 
there are risks in rates of oil and gas production  development expenditures  and cash flows 
projecting the effects of commodity prices on production  and timing of development expenditures include many factors beyond the company s control 
the future estimates of net cash flows from the company s proved reserves and their present value are based upon various assumptions about future production levels  prices  and costs that may prove to be incorrect over time 
any significant variance from assumptions could result in the actual future net cash flows being materially different from the estimates 
oil and gas operations involve substantial costs and are subject to various economic risks 
the company s oil and gas operations are subject to the economic risks typically associated with exploration  development and production activities  including the necessity of significant expenditures to locate and acquire producing properties and to drill exploratory wells 
in conducting exploration and development activities  the presence of unanticipated pressure or irregularities in formations  miscalculations or accidents may cause the company s exploration  development and production activities to be unsuccessful 
this could result in a total loss of the company s investment 
in addition  the cost and timing of drilling  completing and operating wells is often uncertain 
the company has significant costs to conform to government regulation of the oil and gas industry 
the company s exploration  production and marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal  state and local levels 
the company has made and will continue to make large expenditures in its efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental and other regulations 
further  the oil and gas regulatory environment could change in ways that might substantially increase these costs 
hydrocarbon producing states regulate conservation practices and the protection of correlative rights 
these regulations affect the company s operations and limit the quantity of hydrocarbons it may produce and sell 
in addition  at the federal level  the federal energy regulatory commission regulates interstate transportation of natural gas under the natural gas act 
other regulated matters include marketing  pricing  transportation and valuation of royalty payments 
the company has significant costs related to environmental matters 
the company s operations are subject to numerous and frequently changing laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
the company owns or leases  and has owned or leased  properties that have been leased for the exploration and production of oil and gas and these properties and the wastes disposed on these properties may be subject to the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  the oil pollution act of  the resource conservation and recovery act  the federal water pollution control act and similar state laws 
under such laws  the company could be required to remove or remediate wastes or property contamination 
laws and regulations protecting the environment have generally become more stringent and  may in some cases  impose strict liability for environmental damage 
strict liability means that the company may be held liable for damage without regard to whether it was negligent or otherwise at fault 
environmental laws and regulations may expose the company to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the imposition of administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
the company s ability to conduct continued operations is subject to satisfying applicable regulatory and permitting controls 
the company s current permits and authorizations and ability to get future permits and authorizations may be susceptible  on a going forward basis  to increased scrutiny  greater complexity resulting in increased costs or delays in receiving appropriate authorizations 
insurance does not cover all risks 
exploration for and production of oil and natural gas can be hazardous  involving unforeseen occurrences such as blowouts  cratering  fires and loss of well control  which can result in damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities  injury to persons  loss of life  or damage to property or the environment 
although the company maintains insurance against certain losses or liabilities arising from its operations in accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts that management believes to be prudent  insurance is not available to the company against all operational risks 
the company is not competitive with respect to acquisitions or personnel 
the oil and gas business is highly competitive 
in addition  the company is presently in a weak financial condition 
in seeking any suitable oil and gas properties for acquisition  or drilling rig operators and related personnel and equipment  the company is not able to compete with most other companies  including large oil and gas companies and other independent operators with greater financial and technical resources and longer history and experience in property acquisition and operation 
the company depends on key personnel  whom it may not be able to retain or recruit 
members of present management and certain company employees have substantial expertise in the areas of endeavor presently conducted and to be engaged in by the company 
to the extent that their services become unavailable  the company would be required to retain other qualified personnel 
the company does not know whether it would be able to recruit and hire qualified persons upon acceptable terms 
the company does not maintain key person insurance for any of the company s key employees 
general economic conditions 
virtually all of the company s operations are subject to the risks and uncertainties of adverse changes in general economic conditions  the outcome of pending and or potential legal or regulatory proceedings  changes in environmental  tax  labor and other laws and regulations to which the company is subject  and the condition of the capital markets utilized by the company to finance its operations

item properties property location  facilities  size and nature of ownership swan creek field the company s swan creek leases are on approximately  acres in hancock  claiborne  knox  jefferson  morgan and union counties in tennessee 
the initial terms of these leases vary from one to five years 
some of them will terminate unless the company has commenced drilling 
in  the company reduced the acreage comprising the swan creek field from approximately  acres to  acres 
in  the acreage in the swan creek field was again reduced to  acres 
in  the acreage in the swan creek was further reduced to the present  acres 
these reductions in acreage were a result of the company having a better understanding of the geological and geophysical makeup of the swan creek field 
management believes the acreage eliminated from the field does not have the potential to produce commercial quantities of oil or gas and that the reduction of this acreage does not affect the reserves of the swan creek field 
further  the elimination of the leases for this acreage will result in beneficial cost savings to the company 
morita properties  inc  an affiliate of shigemi morita  a former director of the company  currently has a overriding royalty in nine of the company s existing wells  and a overriding royalty and overriding royalty  respectively  in two of the company s other existing wells 
all of these wells are located in the swan creek field and all but two are presently producing wells 
in addition  to those interests  morita properties  inc previously owned a working interest in three of the company s other existing wells and working interest in another of the company s wells which it subsequently sold 
an individual who is not an affiliate of the company purchased working interests in two other wells  the stephen lawson no 
and the patton no 
both of these wells are located in the swan creek field 
of these two wells only the stephen lawson no 
continues to produce 
another individual has a revenue interest in the laura jean lawson no 
well by virtue of having contributed her unleased acreage to the drilling unit and paying her proportionate share of the drilling costs of the well 
the company was obligated to allow that individual to participate on that basis in accordance with both customary industry practice and the requirements of the procedures of the tennessee oil and gas board in a forced pooling action brought by the company to require the acreage to be included in the unit so that the well could be drilled 
the forced pooling procedure was concluded by her contribution of acreage and agreement to pay her proportionate share of drilling costs 
the company also entered into a farmout agreement with miller petroleum  inc miller for ten wells to be drilled in the swan creek field with the company having an option to award up to an additional ten future wells 
all locations were to be mutually agreed upon 
net revenues  as defined  are to be to miller 
the company s subsidiary tpc will transport miller s gas 
the company reserved all offset locations to wells drilled under the farmout agreement 
all ten wells have been drilled under the farmout agreement 
the company acquired back from miller a working interest from miller in nine of those ten wells in addition to its rights under the farmout agreement 
in addition  the company and miller have drilled two additional wells on a basis  although the company declined to exercise its option for a ten well extension of the farmout agreement 
of the wells in which miller owns an interest  six are presently producing 
other than the working interests described or referred to in this item  the company retains all other working interests in wells drilled or to be drilled in the swan creek field 
other working interest owners in oil and gas wells in which the company has working interests are entitled to market their respective shares of production to purchasers other than purchasers with whom the company has contracted 
absent such contractual arrangements being made by the working interest owners  the company is authorized but is not required to provide a market for oil or gas attributable to working interest owners production 
at this time  the company has not agreed to market gas for any working interest owner to customers other than customers of the company 
if the company were to agree to market gas for working interest owners to customers other than the company s customers  the company would have to agree  at that time  to the terms of such marketing arrangements and it is possible that as a result of such arrangements  the company s revenues from such production may be correspondingly reduced 
if the working interest owners make their own arrangements to market their natural gas to other end users along the company s pipeline such gas would be transported by tpc at published tariff rates 
the current published tariff rate is for firm transportation at a demand or reservation charge of five cents per mmbtu per day plus a commodity charge of per mmbtu 
if the working interest owners do not market their production  either independently or through the company  then their interest will be treated as not yet produced and will be balanced either when marketing arrangements are made by such working interest owners or when the well ceases to produce in accordance with customary industry practice 
kansas properties the kansas properties as of december  contained leases totaling  acres in the vicinity of hays  kansas 
the increase in the company s acreage in kansas from  acres in to the current total is due to the company s acquisition of new leases in those areas close to its existing  productive wells 
the company intends to increase its acreage in kansas through the continued acquisition of new leases 
the terms on the company s original leases in the kansas properties were from to years and in most cases have expired 
most of these leases  however  are still in effect because they are being held by production 
the company maintains a working interest in most wells 
the leases provide for a landowner royalty of 
some wells are subject to an overriding royalty interest from to 
although the company does not pay taxes on its swan creek leases  it pays ad valorem taxes on its kansas properties 
the company has general liability insurance for the kansas properties and the swan creek field 
the company leases its principal executive offices  consisting of approximately  square feet located at main avenue  suite  knoxville  tennessee at a rental of  per month and an office in hays  kansas at a rental of per month 
reserve analyses ryder scott company  lp of houston  texas ryder scott has performed reserve analyses of all the company s productive leases 
ryder scott and its employees and its registered petroleum engineers have no interest in the company  and performed these services at their standard rates 
the net reserve values used hereafter were obtained from a reserve report dated january  the report prepared by ryder scott as of december  the report indicates the company s total proven all categories reserves for the company to be as follows net production volumes of  barrels of oil and  mmcf of gas 
the pre tax present value discounted at pv is stated to be  the report indicates the proven developed producing reserves for the company to be as follows net production volumes of  barrels of oil and  mmcf of gas 
the pre tax present value discounted at pv is stated to be  in substance  the report used estimates of oil and gas reserves based upon standard petroleum engineering methods which include production data  decline curve analysis  volumetric calculations  pressure history  analogy  various correlations and technical factors 
information for this purpose was obtained from owners of interests in the areas involved  state regulatory agencies  commercial services  outside operators and files of ryder scott 
the net reserve values in the report were adjusted to take into account the working interests that have been sold by the company in various wells in the swan creek field 
the company believes that the reserve analysis reports prepared by ryder scott for the company for the swan creek field and kansas properties provide an essential basis for review and consideration of the company s producing properties by all potential industry partners and all financial institutions across the country 
it is standard in the industry for reserve analyses such as these to be used as a basis for financing of drilling costs 
the company has not filed the reserve analysis reports prepared by ryder scott or any other reserve reports with any federal authority or agency other than the sec 
the company  however  has filed the information in the report of the company s reserves with the energy information service of the department of energy in compliance with that agency s statutory function of surveying oil and gas reserves nationwide 
the term proved oil and gas reserves is defined in rule a of regulation s x promulgated by the sec as follows proved oil and gas reserves 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions  ie  prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made 
prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements  but not on escalations based upon future conditions 
i 
reservoirs are considered proved if economic producibility is supported by either actual production or conclusive formation test 
the area of a reservoir considered proved includes a that portion delineated by drilling and defined by gas oil and or oil water contacts  if any  and b the immediately adjoining portions not yet drilled  but which can be reasonably judged as economically productive on the basis of available geological and engineering data 
in the absence of information on fluid contacts  the lowest known structural occurrence of hydrocarbons controls the lower proved limit of the reservoir 
ii 
reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques such as fluid injection are included in the proved classification when successful testing by a pilot project  or the operation of an installed program in the reservoir  provides support for the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based 
iii 
estimates of proved reserves do not include the following a oil that may become available from known reservoirs but is classified separately as indicated additional reserves  b crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids  the recovery of which is subject to reasonable doubt because of uncertainty as to geology  reservoir characteristics  or economic factors  c crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids  that may occur in undrilled prospects  and d crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids  that may be recovered from oil shales  coal  gilsonite and other such sources 
production the following tables summarize for the past three fiscal years the volumes of oil and gas produced to the company s interests  the company s operating costs and the company s average sales prices for its oil and gas

in the company drilled two wells in the swan creek field which resulted in one producing well  the steve lawson this well was completed as a knox gas well with an average monthly production of approximately mcf 
the other well  the hazel sutton was drilled to the knox formation  but did not result in the production of commercial volumes of gas 
an attempt was made to have this well produce oil from the trenton formation  a shallower interval  but this also proved unsuccessful as the wellbore encountered technical problems 
the company does not believe it is likely that commercial quantities of oil or gas will occur from this well and it is anticipated that upon final review it will be plugged 
in august  the company  based on d seismic data also drilled one well in kansas to the arbuckle formation  the lewis this well is currently producing approximately barrels per day and has produced  gross barrels since its completion 
the success of the lewis and the ongoing success of the company and the industry in kansas through the use of d seismic data indicates that the potential return on drilling investments in kansas remains strong 
during the past three fiscal years  the company drilled one exploratory well in in cocke county  tennessee which did not result in finding commercial quantities of hydrocarbons

the company realized oil and gas revenues of  in compared to  in and compared to  in revenues remained stable in from levels with a slight increase in from levels due to increases in prices received for sales of oil and gas 
the volume of gas sold from the swan creek field decreased to  mcf in from  mcf in and the volume of oil sold from swan creek field decreased to  barrels in from  barrels in the decline in volumes of oil and gas produced in the swan creek field from existing wells is normal for any producing well and the declines as experienced were not unexpected 
the decrease in volumes was offset by increases in price of the oil and gas volumes sold 
oil and gas volumes produced from the company s kansas properties remained relatively constant  experiencing expected small declines in production consistent with the age of the producing properties 
again  such declines are normal and are expected to continue 
gas prices received for sales of gas from the swan creek field averaged per mcf in  in  and in oil prices received for sales of oil from the swan creek field averaged in  in  and in gas prices received for sales of each mcf of gas in kansas averaged in  in  and in oil prices received for sales of oil in kansas averaged per barrel in  in  and in the company s subsidiary  tpc  had pipeline transportation revenues of  in  a decrease from  in and  in resulting from the decrease in volumes of gas produced from the swan creek field 
the company s production costs and taxes have increased from to production costs and taxes in of  remained consistent with levels 
the production costs and taxes increased in to  from  in this increase was due to the fact that the company s field personnel cost was capitalized as the company was drilling new wells in  compared to and in and all employees were working to maintain production and these costs  including field salaries in swan creek  were expensed 
the remaining increase is due to increased property taxes on the pipeline because it has been assessed at a higher value after completion 
depletion  depreciation  and amortization decreased to  in from  in and  in the decrease in was due to declines in volumes produced and a reduction in depreciation taken on equipment sold in the company reduced its general administrative costs to  in from  in and  in 
management has made a significant effort to control costs in every aspect of its operations 
some of these cost reductions include the reduction of personnel from and levels and utilization of existing employees to perform drafting and file preparation services previously performed by third parties at additional cost

liquidity and capital resources on november   the company signed a credit facility agreement with the energy finance division of bank one  na in houston  texas 
the company instituted litigation in may based on certain actions taken by bank one 
on may   the company resolved its dispute with bank one 
the company had anticipated that when its dispute with bank one was resolved it would be able to obtain financing from other institutional lenders to allow the company to continue to both develop existing properties and locate and purchase additional properties 
to date  however  due to the financial status of the company including debt obligations owed  the company s credit history  and the inability of the company to pay accrued distributions on its preferred stock  the company has not been able to establish a banking relationship with another institutional lender 
although management continues to attempt to locate a source or sources of institutional financing for company operations  there can be no assurances that such relationships can be established or that bank financing will be obtained or of the terms of such relationship 
management believes that the company has made significant progress in in meeting the company s obligations under previous financing vehicles for company operations and positioning the company for future growth 
in  all material litigation involving the company was resolved  eliminating the substantial ongoing costs and expenses of such litigation to the company 
in  the company s rights offering successfully raised sufficient capital to pay in full all preexisting secured debt in the amount of million  most of which had been obtained at relatively high interest rates 
in addition  unsecured convertible notes entered into in in the principal amount of million were fully paid  and other convertible notes entered into in in the original principal amount of  were paid in full in march additionally  in december  the company completed an exchange offer to the thirteen holders of all of the company s series a cumulative convertible preferred stock series a shares in the face amount of  seven of the thirteen holders elected to exchange their shares for cash 
accordingly  the face amount of  of series a shares was exchanged on or before december  for  in cash 
the company obtained funds for the exchange from cash on hand and the proceeds of a loan from dolphin offshore partners  lp dolphin 
the company recognized a gain on shares exchanged for cash of  as of december  the loan from dolphin was in the form of a note in principal amount of  bearing interest per annum interest only payable until due on may  and secured by a lien on the company s tennessee and kansas assets 
five of the thirteen series a shareholders selected the drilling program exchange option and on december  the face value of  of series a shares plus dividend valued at  were exchanged for approximately units in the program 
the remaining units in the drilling program continue to be owned by the company 
under the terms of the drilling program exchange  the former series a shareholders participating in the drilling program will receive all the cash flow from each of eight wells to be drilled in kansas  until they have recovered of the value of the series a shares exchanged 
at that point  the company will begin to receive of the cash flow from these wells as a management fee  and the former series a owners will continue to receive of the cash flow for the productive life of the wells 
as a result  as of december  the company has remaining only one series a shareholder owning series a shares with a face value of  management believes this was a successful and beneficial exchange for both the company and the former series a shareholders 
on march   the company sold its gas producing properties in rush county  kansas for million and used the net proceeds of the sale to pay down the million debt incurred by the company to fund the settlement of the litigation with bank one in may  this has the effect of reducing the payment of high interest on this note  and reducing the total secured debt owed by the company to approximately  as of the date of this report  consisting of about  remaining principal of the million note  and the principal of the  note used for the cash exchange of series a shares 
as a result of the payment of this secured and unsecured debt  and the exchange of most of the series a shares  management believes the company is now better positioned to both establish a banking relationship with an institutional lender on acceptable terms to fund the company s activities 
although the company is hopeful that as a result of the substantial reduction of its debt position that it will soon be able to establish such a relationship  there is no assurance it will be able to do so 
until the company is able to establish such a relationship  it will be necessary to fund its operations  including capital expenditures for the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas reserves from other sources  such as the rights offering as well as equity investment  private loans or a joint venture with other companies  as to which there can be no assurances 
in addition to its operational cash requirements  the company also has a significant amount of loans and other obligations which will either become due or mature on may   including secured promissory notes due to dolphin in the principal amount of  plus interest thereon  as well as the payment of the accrued distributions on the company s series b cumulative convertible preferred stock in the amount of  and the scheduled redemption of both the series b and series c cumulative convertible preferred stock which become due on august  and april   respectively

the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing the company s financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues based on actual volumes of oil and gas sold and delivered to its customers 
natural gas meters are placed at the customers location and usage is billed each month 
crude oil is stored and at the time of delivery to the customers  revenues are recognized 
full cost method of accounting the company follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property acquisition  exploration and development activities 
under this method  all productive and non productive costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of  exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves for each cost center are capitalized 
capitalized costs include lease acquisitions  geological and geophysical work  daily rentals and the costs of drilling  completing and equipping oil and gas wells 
the company capitalized   and  of these costs in  and  respectively 
costs  however  associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
interest costs related to unproved properties and properties under development are also capitalized to oil and gas properties 
gains or losses are recognized only upon sales or dispositions of significant amounts of oil and gas reserves representing an entire cost center 
proceeds from all other sales or dispositions are treated as reductions to capitalized costs 
the capitalized oil and gas property  less accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization and related deferred income taxes  if any  are generally limited to an amount the ceiling limitation equal to the sum of a the present value of estimated future net revenues computed by applying current prices in effect as of the balance sheet date with consideration of price changes only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves  less estimated future expenditures based on current costs to be incurred in developing and producing the reserves using a discount factor of and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions  and b the cost of investments in unevaluated properties excluded from the costs being amortized 
no ceiling write downs were recorded in  or oil and gas reserves depletion depreciation and amortization of oil and gas properties the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  plus estimated future development costs relating to proved reserves and estimated costs of plugging and abandonment  net of estimated salvage value  are amortized on the unit of production method based on total proved reserves 
the costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated  subject to an annual assessment of whether impairment has occurred 
the company s proved oil and gas reserves as at december  were estimated by ryder scott  lp  petroleum consultants 
projecting the effects of commodity prices on production  and timing of development expenditures include many factors beyond the company s control 
the future estimates of net cash flows from the company s proved reserves and their present value are based upon various assumptions about future production levels  prices  and costs that may prove to be incorrect over time 
any significant variance from assumptions could result in the actual future net cash flows being materially different from the estimates 
asset retirement obligations the company is required to record the effects of contractual or other legal obligations on well abandonments for capping and plugging wells 
management periodically reviews the estimate of the timing of the wells closure as well as the estimated closing costs  discounted at the credit adjusted risk free rate of 
quarterly  management accretes the discount into the liability and makes other adjustments to the liability for well retirements incurred during the period 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus that mineral rights  as defined in eitf issue no 
 whether mineral rights are tangible or intangible asset  are tangible assets and that they should be removed as examples of intangible assets in sfas nos 
and the fasb has recently ratified this consensus and directed the fasb staff to amend sfas nos 
and through the issuance of fasb staff positions fsp fas and fsp fas historically the company has included the cost of such mineral rights as tangible assets  which is consistent with the eitf s consensus 
as such  eitf will not affect the company s consolidated condensed financial statements 
staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 regarding the application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  by oil and gas producing companies following the full cost accounting method was issued in september sab provided an interpretation of how a company  after adopting statement  should compute the full cost ceiling to avoid double counting the expected future cash outflows associated with asset retirement costs 
the provisions of this interpretation have been applied by the company and has no impact on the financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this statement is a revision to sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
this statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  primarily focusing on the accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
companies will be required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service  the requisite service period usually the vesting period  in exchange for the award 
the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using option pricing models 
if an equity award is modified after the grant date  incremental compensation cost will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modifications 
sfas no 
r will be effective for periods beginning after june  and allows for several alternative transition methods 
accordingly  the company will adopt sfas no 
r in its third quarter of fiscal the company is currently evaluating the provisions of sfas no 
r and has not determined the impact that this statement will have on its results of operations or financial position 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations    capital lease obligations operating lease obligations   purchase obligations other long term liabilities    total    the company has entered into a drilling program with former holders of its series a preferred stock 
the company is contractually obligated to drill wells in the program  of which are expected to be completed in the company has recorded an aggregate liability of  on its consolidated balance sheet as of december  this amount is included in other long term liabilities in the table above 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s commodity risk the company s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its oil and gas production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas production 
historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable and price volatility is expected to continue 
monthly oil price realizations ranged from a low of per barrel to a high of per barrel during gas price realizations ranged from a monthly low of per mcf to a monthly high of per mcf during the same period 
the company did not enter into any hedging agreements in to limit exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations 
interest rate risk at december   the company had debt outstanding of approximately  at a fixed rate 
the company did not have any open derivative contracts relating to interest rates at december  forward looking statements and risk certain statements in this report  including statements of the future plans  objectives  and expected performance of the company  are forward looking statements that are dependent upon certain events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside the company s control  and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
some of these include  but are not limited to  the market prices of oil and gas  economic and competitive conditions  inflation rates  legislative and regulatory changes  financial market conditions  political and economic uncertainties of foreign governments  future business decisions  and other uncertainties  all of which are difficult to predict 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
the total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from estimates 
the drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks  including those related to timing  success rates and cost overruns 
lease and rig availability  complex geology and other factors can also affect these risks 
additionally  fluctuations in oil and gas prices  or a prolonged period of low prices  may substantially adversely affect the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows
