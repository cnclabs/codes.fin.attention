the company essentially completed the integration of its prior period acquisitions and undertook the integration of current year acquisitions 
the integration plan for these acquisitions included the realization of economies of scale and cost synergies in purchasing of pharmaceuticals and in consolidation of overlapping geographic locations and redundant functions 
sales growth in omnicare s existing pharmacy operations also served to further leverage its cost structure 
in addition to the benefits of economies of scale generated by these growth programs  the company also instituted other cost saving initiatives designed to respond to pricing and reimbursement pressures and to improve the overall cost efficiency of its operations 
contributing in large measure to the increase in sales for the full year ended december  was the impact of the company s acquisition programs  which included acquisitions during the year 
the total increase in sales as a result of these transactions is estimated at approximately million 
additionally  sales increased for the full year ended december   as compared to the prior year period  due to the acquisition of sunscript in july further  pharmacy services sales increased due to the continued implementation and expansion of the company s clinical and other service programs  drug price inflation and the further market penetration of newer branded drugs targeted at the diseases of the elderly  which often carry higher prices but are significantly more effective in reducing overall healthcare costs than those they replace 
the increased operating income was primarily the result of increased sales  ongoing benefits of the company s acquisition integration efforts and productivity initiatives throughout the pharmacy services segment

financial condition  liquidity and capital resources net cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december  were million  compared with million for the same period of operating cash flows during the year ended december  were unfavorably impacted by a one time deposit of million made during the first quarter of  owing to a change in payment terms under the company s new contract with its drug wholesaler 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  another broad based slowdown in medicaid reimbursement from the state of illinois  unfavorably impacted cash flow by approximately million 
furthermore  cash flow for the full years and was unfavorably impacted by the reduction in an acquired company s payable to its previous drug wholesaler for approximately million and million  respectively

for the years ended december  total net sales    net income    earnings per share basic diluted ebitda a    a ebitda represents earnings before interest net of investment income  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the company believes that certain investors find ebitda to be a useful tool for measuring a company s ability to service its debt  which is also the primary purpose for which management uses this financial measure 
however  ebitda does not represent net cash flows from operating activities  as defined by united states us gaap  and should not be considered as a substitute for operating cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
the company s calculation of ebitda may differ from the calculation of ebitda by others

these factors were partially offset by continued intensified competitive pricing pressures  medicaid reimbursement reductions  including overall reimbursement formula changes in certain states  as well as drug specific pricing reductions or limitations on certain generic drugs  and a continued shift in its payor mix toward lower margin medicaid business 
also impacting the results was the increased use of generic drugs and a special charge during in connection with certain state medicaid audits related to prior periods  which lowered sales by approximately million

sunscript served these facilities through its network of long term care pharmacies 
the net assets and operating results of sunscript have been included from the date of acquisition in the company s financial statements 
cro services segment like others in the contract research cro industry  the performance of the company s cro business reflects the somewhat volatile nature of this business given the numerous variables outside the company s control

increased leverage in purchasing favorably impacts gross profit and is primarily derived through discounts from suppliers 
leveraging of fixed and variable overhead costs primarily relates to generating higher sales volumes from pharmacy facilities with no increase in fixed costs eg  rent and minimal increases in variable costs eg  utilities  as well as the elimination of pharmacies through the company s productivity and consolidation initiatives  further discussed below 
the company believes it will be able to continue to leverage fixed and variable overhead costs through internal and acquired growth 
government and other reimbursement formulas generally adjust to take into account drug price inflation or deflation 
in order to enhance its gross profit margins  the company strategically allocates its resources to those activities that will increase internal sales growth and favorably impact sales mix or will lower costs 
in addition  through the ongoing development of its pharmaceutical purchasing programs  the company is able to obtain volume discounts and thereby manage its pharmaceutical costs

at december   the weighted average interest rate on funds drawn was  the libor interest rate margin was and the commitment fee was 
there is no utilization fee associated with the credit facility 
the company used the net proceeds from the senior notes offering and borrowings of million under the term a loan portion of the new credit facility to repay the balance of the company s existing revolving credit facility of million  with remaining proceeds being used for general corporate purposes 
the company paid down million on the term a loan during the million outstanding at december  under the term a loan is due in quarterly installments  in varying amounts  through  with approximately million due within one year 
there was million outstanding as of december  under the revolving credit commitment of the credit facility 
the company used a portion of the net proceeds from the common stock offering and the net proceeds from the old trust piers offering to redeem the entire outstanding million aggregate principal amount of the company s convertible debentures  with remaining proceeds being used for general corporate purposes 
the total redemption price  including the call premium  was approximately million 
accordingly  a million pretax charge million aftertax  or per diluted share was recognized in interest expense during the year ended december  for the call premium and the write off of remaining unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the redemption of the convertible debentures 
in  the company completed the issuance  at par value  of million of senior subordinated notes due senior notes 
the senior notes were subsequently exchanged for replacement notes with identical terms  which were registered with the securities and exchange commission 
in connection with its offering of million of senior notes due  during the second quarter of  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement swap agreement on all million of its aggregate principal amount of the senior notes 
under the swap agreement  which hedges against exposure to long term us dollar interest rates  the company will receive a fixed rate of and pay a floating rate based on libor with a maturity of six months plus a spread of 
the floating rate is determined semi annually  in arrears  two london banking days prior to the first of each december and june 
the company records interest expense on the senior notes at the floating rate 
the estimated libor based floating rate was at december  the swap agreement  which matches the terms of the senior notes  is designated and accounted for as a fair value hedge 
the company is accounting for the swap agreement in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  so changes in fair value of the swap agreement are offset by changes in the recorded carrying value of the related senior notes 
the fair value of the swap agreement of approximately million at december  is recorded as a noncurrent liability and a reduction to the carrying value of the related senior notes 
in connection with the offering of the old trust piers in the second quarter of  the company issued a corresponding amount of junior subordinated convertible debentures due to the old trust 
the old trust is a owned finance subsidiary of the company 
the company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the securities of the old trust 
the old trust piers offer fixed cash distributions at a rate of per annum payable quarterly  and a fixed conversion price of under a contingent conversion feature whereby the holders may convert their old trust piers if the closing sales price of omnicare common stock for a predetermined period  beginning with the quarter ending september   is more than of the then applicable conversion price or  during a predetermined period  if the daily average of the trading prices for the old trust piers is less than of the average of the conversion values for the old trust piers through for any period thereafter through maturity 
the old trust piers also will pay contingent distributions  commencing with the quarterly distribution period beginning june   if the average trading prices of the old trust piers for a predetermined period equals or more of the stated liquidation amount of the old trust piers 
embedded in the old trust piers are two derivative instruments  specifically  a contingent interest provision and a contingent conversion parity provision 
the embedded derivatives are periodically valued by a third party advisor  and at december   the values of both derivatives were not material 
however  the values are subject to change  based on market conditions  which could affect the company s future financial position  cash flows and results of operations 
omnicare irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees  on a subordinated basis  certain payments to be made by the old trust in connection with the old trust piers 
on march   the company completed the exchange of  aggregate liquidation amount of the old trust piers representing approximately of the total liquidation amount of the old trust piers outstanding for an equal amount of new trust piers  plus an exchange fee of per stated liquidation amount of old trust piers 
each new trust piers represents an undivided beneficial interest in the assets of the new trust  which assets consist solely of series b junior subordinated convertible debentures issued by omnicare  inc following the consummation of the exchange  approximately  aggregate liquidation amount of old trust piers remain outstanding 
the terms of the new trust piers are substantially identical to the terms of the old trust piers  except that the new trust piers are convertible into cash and  if applicable  shares of omnicare common stock  whereas the outstanding old trust piers are convertible only into omnicare common stock except for cash in lieu of fractional shares 
the purpose of the exchange offer was to change the conversion settlement provisions of the old trust piers 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company made this change in response to the issuance by the eitf of the fasb of eitf issue no 
 which  effective december   changed the accounting rules applicable to the old trust piers and requires omnicare to include the common stock issuable upon conversion of the old trust piers in omnicare s diluted shares outstanding  regardless of whether the market trigger has been met 
by committing to pay up to the stated liquidation amount of the new trust piers to be converted in cash upon conversion  omnicare will be able to account for the new trust piers under the treasury stock method  which is expected to be less dilutive to earnings per share than the if converted method proscribed by eitf the credit facility  the senior notes  the senior notes and the convertible debentures contain representations and warranties  covenants and events of default customary for such facilities 
interest rates charged on borrowings outstanding under the credit facility are based on prevailing market rates as discussed in the following section 
the company believes that net cash flows from operating activities  credit facilities and other short and long term debt financings  if any  will be sufficient to satisfy its future working capital needs  acquisition contingency commitments  debt servicing  capital expenditures and other financing requirements for the foreseeable future 
although the company has no current plans to refinance its indebtedness  issue additional indebtedness  or issue additional equity  except for the aforementioned exchange offering  and other than those associated with the tender offer for neighborcare  discussed above at the neighborcare transaction caption  the company believes that external sources of financing are readily available and will access them as it deems appropriate 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk omnicare s primary market risk exposure relates to interest rate risk exposure through its borrowings 
the company s debt obligations at december  include million outstanding under the term a loan portion and million drawn on the revolving credit commitment portion  of its june four year  variable rate credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of at december  a basis point change in the interest rate would increase or decrease pretax interest expense by approximately million per year  million outstanding under its fixed rate senior notes  due  million outstanding under its fixed rate senior notes  due  and million outstanding under its fixed rate convertible debentures  due in connection with its offering of million of senior notes  during the second quarter of  the company entered into a swap agreement on all million of its aggregate principal amount of the senior notes 
under the swap agreement  which hedges against exposure to long term us dollar interest rates  the company will receive a fixed rate of and pay a floating rate based on libor with a maturity of six months plus a spread of 
the estimated libor based floating rate was at december  a basis point change in the interest rate would increase or decrease pretax interest expense by approximately million per year 
the swap agreement  which matches the terms of the senior notes  is designated and accounted for as a fair value hedge 
the company is accounting for the swap agreement in accordance with sfas no 
 as amended  so changes in the fair value of the swap agreement are offset by changes in the recorded carrying value of the related senior notes 
the fair value of the swap agreement of approximately million at december  is recorded as a noncurrent liability and a reduction to the carrying value of the related senior notes 
at december   the fair value of omnicare s credit facility approximates its carrying value  and the fair value of the senior notes  senior notes and convertible debentures is approximately million  million and million  respectively 
embedded in the old trust piers and the new trust piers are two derivative instruments  specifically  a contingent interest provision and a contingent conversion parity provision 
the embedded derivatives are periodically valued by a third party advisor  and at december   the values of both derivatives embedded in the old trust piers were not material 
however  the values are subject to change  based on market conditions  which could affect the company s future financial position  cash flows and results of operations 
the company has operations and revenue that occur outside of the us and transactions that are settled in currencies other than the us dollar  exposing it to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
however  the substantial portion of the company s operations and revenues and the substantial portion of the company s cash settlements are exchanged in us dollars 
therefore  changes in foreign currency exchange rates do not represent a substantial market risk exposure to the company 
in connection with the acquisition of canada based medico pharmacy  omnicare entered into a million foreign exchange transaction arrangement on december  this arrangement expired on january   and had an immaterial impact on the consolidated financial position  income statement and cash flows of the company during the year 
the company does not have any financial instruments held for trading purposes 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
in connection with the preparation of these financial statements  omnicare management is required to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  stockholders equity  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of commitments and contingencies 
on a regular basis  the company evaluates the estimates used  including those related to bad debts  contractual allowances  inventory valuation  impairment of goodwill  insurance accruals  pension obligations  income taxes  stock based compensation  legal contingencies and other operating allowances and accruals 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable at the time and under the current circumstances 
the company s significant accounting policies are summarized in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by us gaap and does not require significant management judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to the registrant s financial position and operating results  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
omnicare s critical accounting estimates and the related assumptions are evaluated periodically as conditions require revision 
application of the critical accounting policies requires management s significant judgments  often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently and highly uncertain 
if actual results were to differ materially from the judgments and estimates made  the company s reported financial position and or operating results could be materially affected 
omnicare management continually reviews these estimates and assumptions to ensure that the financial statements are presented fairly and are materially correct 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies and estimates involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized by omnicare when products or services are delivered or provided to the customer 
pharmacy services segment a significant portion of the company s pharmacy service segment revenues from sales of pharmaceutical and medical products is reimbursed by state medicaid and  to a lesser extent  federal medicare programs 
payments for services rendered to patients covered by these programs are generally less than billed charges 
the company monitors its revenues and receivables from these reimbursement sources  as well as other third party insurance payors  and records an estimated contractual allowance for certain sales and receivable balances to properly account for anticipated differences between billed and reimbursed amounts 
accordingly  the total net sales and receivables reported in the company s financial statements are recorded at the amount ultimately expected to be received from these payors 
since all billing functions of the company are computerized  enabling on line adjudication ie  submitting charges to medicaid or other third party payors electronically  with simultaneous feedback of the amount to be paid at the time of sale to record net revenues  exposure to estimating contractual allowance adjustments is limited primarily to unbilled and or initially rejected medicaid and third party claims oftentimes eventually approved once additional information is provided to the payor 
the company evaluates several criteria in developing the estimated contractual allowances for unbilled and or initially rejected claims on a monthly basis  including historical trends based on actual claims paid  current contract and reimbursement terms  and changes in customer base and payor product mix 
contractual allowances are adjusted to actual as cash is received and claims are settled 
resulting adjustments were not significant to the company s operations for the periods presented 
further  omnicare does not expect the reasonably possible effects of a change in estimate related to unsettled december  amounts from medicaid and third party payors to be significant to future operating results and financial position 
patient co payments are associated with certain state medicaid programs  medicare part b and certain third party payors and are typically not collected at the time products are delivered or services are rendered  but are billed to the individual as part of the company s normal billing procedures 
these co payments are subject to the company s normal accounts receivable collections procedures 
a patient may be dispensed prescribed medications typically no more than a day supply prior to insurance being verified in emergency situations  or for new facility admissions after hours or on weekends 
the following business day  specific payor information is obtained to ensure that the proper payor is billed for reimbursement 
under certain circumstances  the company accepts returns of medications and issues a credit memo to the applicable payor 
the company estimates and accrues for sales returns based on historical return experience  giving consideration to the company s return policies 
product returns are processed in the period received  and are not significant when compared to the overall sales and gross profit of the company 
contract research services segment a portion of the company s overall revenues relate to the contract research services cro segment  and are earned by performing services under contracts with various pharmaceutical  biotechnology  medical device and diagnostics companies  based on contract terms 
most of the contracts provide for services to be performed on a units of service basis 
these contracts specifically identify the units of service and unit pricing 
under these contracts  revenue is generally recognized upon completion of the units of service 
for time and materials contracts  revenue is recognized at contractual hourly rates  and for fixed price contracts  revenue is recognized using a method similar to that used for units of service 
the company s contracts provide for additional service fees for scope of work changes 
the company recognizes revenue related to these scope changes when underlying services are performed and realization is assured 
in a number of cases  clients are required to make termination payments in addition to payments for services already rendered 
any anticipated losses resulting from contract performance are charged to earnings in the period identified 
billings and payments are specified in each contract 
revenue recognized in excess of billings is classified as unbilled receivables  while billings in excess of revenue are classified as deferred revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts collection of accounts receivable from customers is the company s primary source of operating cash flow and is critical to omnicare s operating performance 
omnicare s primary collection risk relates to facility and private pay customers 
the company provides for accounts receivable that could become uncollectible by establishing an allowance to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
omnicare establishes this allowance for doubtful accounts using the specific identification approach  and considering such factors as historical collection experience ie  payment history and credit losses and creditworthiness  specifically identified credit risks  aging of accounts receivable by payor category  current and expected economic conditions and other relevant factors 
management reviews this allowance on an ongoing basis for appropriateness 
judgment is used to assess the collectibility of account balances and the economic ability of customers to pay 
the company computes and monitors its accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso in order to evaluate the liquidity and collection patterns of its accounts receivable 
dso is calculated by averaging the beginning and end of quarter accounts receivable  less contractual allowances and the allowance for doubtful accounts  to derive average accounts receivable  and dividing average accounts receivable by the sales amount excluding reimbursable out of pockets for the related quarter 
the resultant percentage is multiplied by the days in the quarter to derive the dso amount 
omnicare s dso was approximately days at december   compared with days at december  and days at december  the increase in dso during of days was related  in part  to the impact of the medicaid reimbursement slowdown that occurred in the state of illinois 
the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  was million compared with million and million at december  and  respectively 
these allowances were  and of gross receivables net of contractual allowances as of december   and  respectively 
although no near term changes are expected  unforeseen changes to future allowance percentages could materially impact overall financial results 
a one percentage point increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross receivables as of december   would result in an increase to the allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense of approximately million 
the following table is an aging of the company s december  and gross accounts receivable net of allowances for contractual adjustments  and prior to allowances for doubtful accounts  aged based on payment terms and categorized based on the four primary overall types of accounts receivable characteristics in thousands december  current and days days and over past due past due total medicaid  medicare part b and third party payors    facility payors    private pay payors    cro   total gross accounts receivable net of contractual allowance adjustments    december  current and days days and over past due past due total medicaid  medicare part b and third party payors    facility payors    private pay payors    cro    total gross accounts receivable net of contractual allowance adjustments    patient charges pending approval from medicaid and third party payors are primarily billed as private pay and  where applicable  are recorded net of an estimated contractual allowance at period end 
once an approval to bill medicaid and or third party payors has been obtained  the private pay balance is reversed and a corresponding medicaid or third party receivable amount is recorded 
the company s policy is to resolve accounts receivable with pending status on a weekly basis 
pending accounts receivable balances were not significant at december  omnicare has standard policies and procedures for collection of its accounts receivable 
the company s collection efforts generally include the mailing of statements  followed up when necessary with delinquency notices  personal and other contacts  the use of an in house national collections department or outside collection agencies  and potentially mediation arbitration or litigation when accounts are considered unresponsive 
omnicare s collection efforts primarily relate to its facility and private pay customers 
when omnicare becomes aware that a specific customer is potentially unable to meet part or all of its financial obligations  for example  as a result of bankruptcy or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  the company includes the balance in its allowance for doubtful accounts requirements 
when a balance is deemed uncollectible by omnicare management including the national collections department  collections agencies and or outside legal counsel  the balance is manually written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
at december   the company does not have a significant amount of its overall accounts receivable balance placed in mediation arbitration  litigation or with outside collection agencies 
given the company s experience  management believes that the reserves for potential losses are adequate  but if several or more of the company s larger customers were to unexpectedly default on their obligations  the company s overall reserves for potential losses may prove to be inadequate 
if economic conditions worsen  the payor mix shifts significantly  or the company s customers reimbursement rates are adversely affected  impacting omnicare s customers ability to pay  management may adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly  and the company s accounts receivable collections  cash flows  financial position and results of operations could be affected 
inventories the company maintains inventory at lower of cost or market  with cost determined on the basis of the first in  first out method 
there are no significant obsolescence reserves recorded since the company has not historically experienced nor does it expect to experience significant levels of inventory obsolescence write offs 
omnicare uses a periodic inventory system 
physical inventories are typically performed on a monthly basis at all pharmacy sites  and in all cases at least once a quarter 
cost of goods sold is recorded based on the actual results of the physical inventory counts  and is estimated when a physical inventory is not performed in a particular month 
the company evaluates various criteria in developing estimated cost of goods sold during non inventory months  including the historical cost of goods sold trends based on prior physical inventory results  a review of cost of goods sold information reflecting current customer contract terms  and consideration and analysis of changes in customer base  product mix  payor mix  state medicaid and third party insurance reimbursement levels or other issues that may impact cost of goods sold 
actual cost of goods sold has not varied significantly from estimated amounts in non physical inventory months 
goodwill sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas requires that goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets be reviewed for impairment using a fair value based approach at least annually 
sfas requires the company to assess whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired  and requires goodwill to be tested between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the company s assessments to date have indicated that goodwill has not been impaired 
the company s assessment of goodwill impairment requires estimates of future cash flows and a weighted average cost of capital 
the estimates of these future cash flows are based on assumptions and projections with respect to future revenues and expenses believed to be reasonable and supportable at the time the annual impairment analysis is performed 
further  they require management s subjective judgments and take into account assumptions about overall growth rates and increases in expenses 
to the extent the carrying value of the assets exceed their fair value  an impairment loss would be recorded 
changes in these estimates of future cash flows or weighted average cost of capital due to unforeseen events and circumstances could cause omnicare s analysis to indicate that goodwill is impaired in subsequent periods  and could result in the write off of a portion or all of the company s goodwill  which could be material to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  given the substantial margin by which fair value exceeded carrying amounts in the latest goodwill impairment review  the company does not anticipate a material impact on the consolidated financial statements from differences in these assumptions in the near term 
insurance accruals omnicare is self insured for certain employee health insurance claims 
the company manages its health insurance risk by obtaining individual and aggregate stop loss coverage in the amount of  per claim and of expected aggregate claims  or approximately million for the year 
omnicare insures all of its property and casualty programs including worker s compensation and professional liability in excess of self insured retentions  or deductibles  on the various policies of insurance which range from between  and  per claim  depending on the type of coverage 
omnicare closely monitors and continually evaluates its historical claims experience and obtains input from third party insurance professionals to estimate the appropriate level of accrual for its self insured programs  including deductibles 
these accruals include provision for incurred  as well as incurred but not reported  claims 
in developing its self insurance accrual estimates  the company s liability calculation also considers the historical claim lag periods and current payment trends of insurance claims generally months for health  and months for all other coverages 
a change in the historical claim lag period assumption by one month for health insurance claims would affect health insurance expense by approximately million pretax 
a change in the historical claim lag period by one month for property and casualty insurance claims would affect property and casualty insurance expense by approximately million pretax 
although significant fluctuations may occur in the short term due to unforeseen events and claims  the company s experience  coupled with its stop loss coverages  has consistently supported management s assumption that this methodology provides for reasonable insurance expense estimates and accruals over a long term period 
while the ultimate settlement of these claims may vary from the company s estimates and accruals  omnicare believes that the accrual amounts and resultant expense provided in the consolidated financial statements are materially correct 
employee benefit plans for certain of its employee benefit plans  the company utilizes estimates in developing its actuarial assumptions including such items as the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  discount rate and rate of compensation increase  among other items  and relies on actuarial computations to estimate the future potential liability  expense and funding requirements associated with these benefits 
while it is required that the actuarial assumptions be reviewed each year as of the measurement date of december  the actuarial assumptions generally do not change between measurement dates 
during omnicare s annual review  generally near the beginning of the fiscal year  the company reviews and updates these assumptions  and considers current market conditions and input from its third party advisors  including any changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
these actuarial assumptions and estimates attempt to anticipate future events  and if assessed differently or materially vary from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  could have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  a one percentage point change in any of the individual aforementioned assumptions used to calculate the company s pension obligation  holding all other assumptions constant  would not have a material impact on the company s operating results 
income taxes the company estimates its tax assets and liabilities based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which it operates 
these estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  as well as the realization of deferred tax assets including those relating to net operating losses 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized 
omnicare periodically reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence 
this evidence includes historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
projected future taxable income is based on the company s expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned 
the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences is based on current tax law and omnicare s tax methods of accounting 
the company also reviews its liabilities under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas which requires an accrual for estimated losses when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
these projections may change in the future as actual results become known 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  or if the tax laws change unfavorably  then the company could be required to increase its valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets  resulting in an increase in the effective tax rate 
omnicare operates in multiple states with varying tax laws 
the company is subject to both federal and state audits of tax returns 
while the company believes it has provided adequately for income tax liabilities in its consolidated financial statements  adverse determinations by these taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on omnicare s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
if the provisions for current or deferred taxes are not adequate  if the company is unable to realize certain deferred tax assets or if the tax laws change unfavorably  the company could experience potential losses 
likewise  if provisions for current and deferred taxes are in excess of those eventually needed  if the company is able to realize additional deferred tax assets or if tax laws change favorably  the company could experience potential gains 
a one percentage point change in the company s overall  and effective tax rates would impact income tax expense and net income by million  million and million  respectively or  and per diluted share  respectively 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock incentive plans under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations 
no stock based employee compensation cost for stock options is reflected in net income  as all options granted under the plans had an exercise price equal to or greater than the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
for footnote disclosure purposes  the company calculates the impact of using the fair value method in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas 
under the fair value method  the cost of stock option grants and other incentive awards to employees and directors is generally measured by the fair value of the awards on their grant dates and is recognized over the vesting periods of the awards 
the company estimates the fair value of stock option grants as of the date of each grant  using a black scholes option pricing model 
this model incorporates reasoned assumptions regarding the expected volatility of the company s common stock price  estimated risk free interest rates  the expected dividend yield  if any  all over the expected lives of the respective options 
considering the importance of each of the above assumptions in the calculation of fair value  the company re evaluates the estimate of these assumptions on a quarterly basis 
while the company believes its stock option fair value calculations are materially accurate  a one percentage point change in any of the individual aforementioned assumptions  holding all other assumptions constant  would not have a material impact on the fair value calculated for options or the related pro forma periodic expense recognized by the company in its footnote disclosure 
legal contingencies as part of its ongoing operations  the company is subject to various inspections  audits  inquiries and similar actions by governmental regulatory authorities responsible for enforcing the laws and regulations to which the company is subject  including reviews of individual omnicare pharmacy s reimbursement documentation and administrative practices 
oftentimes  these inspections  audits and inquiries relate to prior periods  including periods predating omnicare s actual ownership of a particular acquired pharmacy 
the company is also involved with various legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
each quarter  the company reviews the status of any inspections  audits  inquiries  legal claims and legal proceedings and assesses its potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any of these is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  the company accrues a liability for the estimated loss  in accordance with sfas to the extent the amount of a probable loss is estimable only by reference to a range of equally probable outcomes  and no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount  the low end of the range is accrued 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  the use of estimates  assumptions  judgments and external factors beyond the company s control  accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  omnicare reassesses the potential liability related to any pending inspections  audits  inquiries  claims and litigation and may revise its estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on the company s results of operations and financial position 
recently issued accounting standards in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb ratified eitf no 
 the effect of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share  which requires the shares underlying contingently convertible debt instruments to be included in diluted earnings per share computations using the if converted accounting method  regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met 
under that method  the convertible debentures are assumed to be converted to common shares weighted for the number of days assumed to be outstanding during the period  and interest expense  net of taxes  related to the convertible debentures is added back to net income 
diluted earnings per common share amounts have been retroactively restated for prior periods presented to give effect to the application of eitf no 
as it relates to the company s convertible debentures issued in the second quarter of the effect of omnicare s fourth quarter adoption of eitf no 
was to decrease diluted earnings per share for the three months ended december  and  and and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for purposes of the if converted calculation   shares were assumed to be converted for the quarters ended december  and  and the year ended december   with  shares assumed to be converted for the year ended december  additionally  interest expense  net of taxes  of million for the quarters ended december  and  and million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  was added back to net income for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share using this method

outlook the company derives approximately one half of its revenues directly from government sources  principally state medicaid and to a lesser extent federal medicare programs  and one half from the private sector including individual residents  third party insurers and snfs 
as part of ongoing operations  the company and its customers are subject to regulatory changes in the level of reimbursement received from the medicare and medicaid programs 
since  congress has passed a number of federal laws that have effected major changes in the healthcare system 
the balanced budget act of the bba sought to achieve a balanced federal budget by  among other things  changing the reimbursement policies applicable to various healthcare providers 
in a significant change for the snf industry  the bba provided for the introduction in of the prospective payment system pps for medicare eligible residents of snfs 
prior to pps  snfs under medicare received cost based reimbursement 
under pps  medicare pays snfs a fixed fee per patient per day based upon the acuity level of the resident  covering substantially all items and services furnished during a medicare covered stay  including pharmacy services 
pps resulted in a significant reduction of reimbursement to snfs 
admissions of medicare residents  particularly those requiring complex care  declined in many snfs due to concerns relating to the adequacy of reimbursement under pps 
this caused a weakness in medicare census leading to a significant reduction of overall occupancy in the snfs the company serves 
this decline in occupancy and acuity levels adversely impacted omnicare s results beginning in  as the company experienced lower utilization of omnicare services  coupled with pps related pricing pressure from omnicare s snf customers 
in and  congress sought to restore some of the reductions in reimbursement resulting from pps 
this legislation helped to improve the financial condition of snfs  motivated them to increase admissions  particularly of higher acuity residents  and stabilized the unfavorable operating trends attributable to pps 
one provision gave snfs a temporary rate increase for certain specific high acuity patients beginning april   and ending when the cms implements a refined patient classification system under pps 
cms did not implement such refinements in fiscal years   or  thus continuing the additional rate increases currently in place for certain high acuity patients 
president bush s proposed fiscal year budget indicates that cms intends to implement the refinements in fiscal year  resulting in billion in decreased expenditures in however  it is unclear at this time whether cms will implement rug refinement as described in the president s budget proposal 
also  snf payments under pps are subject to annual market basket increases  which in the past have partially offset the impact of other temporary rate expirations 
nonetheless  the loss of revenues associated with future changes in snf payments could  in the future  have an adverse effect on the financial condition of the company s snf clients which could  in turn  adversely affect the timing or level of their payments to omnicare 
in december  congress enacted the mma  which includes a major expansion of the medicare prescription drug benefit under a new medicare part d 
until the part d benefit goes into effect on january   medicare beneficiaries can receive assistance with their outpatient prescription drug costs through a new prescription drug discount card program  which began in june  and which gives enrollees access to negotiated discounted prices for prescription drugs 
under the mma  medicare beneficiaries may enroll in part d plans which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs effective as of january  medicare beneficiaries generally will have to pay a premium to enroll in a part d plan  with the premium amount varying from plan to plan  although cms will provide various federal subsidies to part d plans to reduce the cost to beneficiaries 
medicare beneficiaries who are also entitled to benefits under a state medicaid program so called dual eligibles will have their prescription drug costs covered by the new medicare drug benefit  including nursing home residents served by the company whose drug costs are currently covered by state medicaid programs 
cms will provide premium and cost sharing subsidies to part d plans with respect to dual eligible residents of nursing homes 
therefore  such dual eligibles will not be required to pay a premium for enrollment in a part d plan  so long as the premium for the part d plan in which they are enrolled is at or below the premium subsidy 
dual eligible residents of nursing homes will be entitled to have all of their prescription drug costs covered by a part d plan  provided that the prescription drugs which they are taking are either on the part d plan s formulary  or an exception to the plan s formulary is granted 
cms will review the formularies of part d plans and has indicated that it will require their formularies to include the types of drugs most commonly needed by medicare beneficiaries  and that plans formulary exceptions criteria provide for coverage of drugs determined by the plan to be medically appropriate for the enrollee 
the mma also makes available partial premium and cost sharing subsidies for certain other classes of low income enrollees who do not qualify for medicaid 
pursuant to the final part d rule  we will obtain reimbursement for drugs we provide to enrollees of a given part d plan in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated between us and that part d plan 
we intend to negotiate such agreements with part d plans under which we would provide drugs and associated services to their enrollees 
until such agreements are negotiated  we will not be able to determine what changes  if any  there may be to the terms and conditions under which we provide drugs and services to medicare beneficiaries who become enrollees of part d plans 
the mma will not change the manner in which medicare pays for drugs for medicare beneficiaries covered in a part a stay 
we will continue to receive reimbursement for drugs provided to such residents from the snfs pursuant to the contracts we have negotiated with each snf 
cms will be issuing subregulatory guidance on many aspects of the final rule throughout as the new program is implemented 
in addition  the secretary of the department of health and human services is required to conduct a study of current standards of practice for pharmacy services provided to patients in long term care settings  and  among other things  make recommendations regarding necessary actions and appropriate reimbursement to ensure the provision of prescription drugs to medicare beneficiaries in nursing facilities consistent with existing patient safety and quality of care standards 
the mma also reforms the medicare part b prescription drug payment methodology  although the company s revenues for drugs dispensed under medicare part b are not significant in comparison to total revenues 
the mma also includes provisions that will institute administrative reforms designed to improve medicare program operations 
it is uncertain at this time the impact that the mma s legislative reforms ultimately will have on the company 
other healthcare funding issues remain  including pressures on federal and state medicaid budgets  which has led to decreasing reimbursement rates in certain states 
some states continue to experience budget shortfalls  which may prompt them to consider implementing reductions in medicaid reimbursement and other cost control measures 
while the company has endeavored to adjust to these pricing pressures  to date  these pressures are likely to continue or escalate  particularly if economic recovery does not emerge  and there can be no assurance that such occurrence will not have an adverse impact on the company s business 
longer term  funding for federal and state healthcare programs must consider the aging of the population and the growth in enrollees as eligibility is expanded  the escalation in drug costs owing to higher drug utilization among seniors and the introduction of new  more efficacious but also more expensive medications  and the long term financing of the medicare and medicaid programs 
given competing national priorities  it remains difficult to predict the outcome and impact on the company of any changes in healthcare policy relating to the future funding of the medicare and medicaid programs 
demographic trends indicate that demand for long term care will increase well into the middle of this century as the elderly population grows significantly 
moreover  those over consume a disproportionately high level of healthcare services  including prescription drugs  when compared with the under population 
there is widespread consensus that appropriate pharmaceutical care is generally considered the most cost effective form of treatment for the chronic ailments afflicting the elderly and also one that is able to improve the quality of life 
further  the pace and quality of new drug development is yielding many promising new drugs targeted at the diseases of the elderly 
these new drugs may be more expensive than older  less effective drug therapies due to rising research costs 
however  they are significantly more effective in curing or ameliorating illness and in lowering overall healthcare costs by reducing  among other things  hospitalizations  physician visits  nursing time and lab tests 
these trends not only support long term growth for the geriatric pharmaceutical industry but also containment of healthcare costs and the well being of the nation s growing elderly population 
in order to fund this growing demand  the company anticipates that the government and the private sector will continue to review  assess and possibly alter healthcare delivery systems and payment methodologies 
while it is not possible to predict the effect of the new medicare part d drug benefit or any further initiatives on omnicare s business  management believes that the company s expertise in geriatric pharmaceutical care and pharmaceutical cost management position omnicare to help meet the challenges of today s healthcare environment 
further  while volatility can occur from time to time in the contract research business owing to factors such as the success or failure of its clients compounds  the timing or budgetary constraints of its clients  or consolidation within our client base  new drug discovery remains an important priority of drug manufacturers 
drug manufacturers  in order to optimize their research and development efforts  will continue to turn to contract research organizations to assist them in accelerating drug research development and commercialization
