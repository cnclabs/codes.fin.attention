management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations pepco holdings  inc 
general overview pepco holdings  inc phi is a public utility holding company that  through its operating subsidiaries  is engaged primarily in three principal areas of business operations electricity and natural gas delivery power delivery  competitive energy generation  marketing and supply competitive energy  and other activities consisting primarily of investments in energy related assets other non regulated 
the power delivery business is the largest component phi s business 
in  power delivery was responsible for of phi s consolidated operating revenues and of its consolidated operating income 
the power delivery business consists primarily of the transmission and distribution of electric power  which was responsible for of power delivery revenues  and the distribution of natural gas  which contributed of power delivery revenues 
the power delivery business is conducted by three regulated utility subsidiaries potomac electric power company pepco  delmarva power light company dpl and atlantic city electric company ace  each of which is a regulated public utility in the jurisdictions that compose its service territory 
each company is responsible for the delivery of electricity and  in the case of dpl  natural gas in its service territory  for which it is paid tariff rates established by the local public service commission 
each company also provides default electricity supply to retail customers in its service territory who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive energy supplier for which it is compensated at regulated rates 
the rates each company is permitted to charge for the transmission of electricity is regulated by ferc 
this means that the profitability of the power delivery business depends on its ability through the rates it is permitted to charge to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on its capital investments 
power delivery s operating revenue and income are seasonal  and weather patterns may have a material impact on operating results 
historically  power delivery operations have generated less revenue and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer 
the competitive energy business provides competitive generation  marketing and supply of electricity and gas  and related energy management services primarily in the mid atlantic region 
these operations are conducted through conectiv energy and pepco energy services  each of which is treated as a separate business segment for financial reporting purposes 
in  the competitive energy segment  including intercompany transactions  was responsible for of phi s consolidated operating revenues and of its consolidated operating income 
of this segment s operating revenues  of phi s consolidated operating revenues were attributable to sales to the power delivery segment 
conectiv energy provides wholesale power  capacity and ancillary services in the wholesale markets administered by pjm and also supplies electricity to other wholesale market participants under long term bilateral contracts 
conectiv energy has a power supply agreement under which it provides dpl with default electricity supply for distribution to customers in delaware and virginia 
conectiv energy also supplies a portion of the default electricity supply that ace acquires for its distribution customers 
conectiv energy obtains the electricity required to meet its power supply obligations from its own generation plants  under bilateral contract purchases from other wholesale market participants and from purchases in the pjm wholesale market 
conectiv energy also sells natural gas and fuel oil to very large end users and to wholesale market participants under bilateral agreements 
pepco energy services sells retail electricity and natural gas primarily in the mid atlantic region and provides integrated energy management services 
pepco energy services also provides high voltage construction and maintenance services to utilities and other customers throughout the united states and low voltage electric and telecommunication construction and maintenance services primarily in the washington  dc area 
the primary objectives of the competitive energy business are to manage conectiv energy s generation assets to match wholesale energy supply with load and to capture retail energy supply and service opportunities in the mid atlantic region 
the financial results of the competitive energy business can be significantly affected by wholesale and retail energy prices  the cost of fuel to operate the conectiv energy plants  and the cost of purchased energy necessary to meet its power supply obligations 
in order to lower its financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations and provide a more predictable earnings stream  the competitive energy business frequently enters into contracts to hedge the power output of its generation facilities  the costs of fuel used to operate those facilities and its energy supply obligations 
this hedging strategy is more fully discussed in item business 
like the power delivery business  the competitive energy business is seasonal  and therefore weather patterns can have a material impact on operating results 
the other non regulated business has been conducted primarily through two subsidiaries of phi potomac capital investment corporation pci manages an existing portfolio of financial investments primarily consisting of energy leveraged leases 
during the second quarter of pci discontinued all new investment activities 
pepco communications  inc pepcom  which in december  sold its only asset  a membership interest in starpower communications  llc starpower  a joint venture with rcn corporation rcn  to rcn for million in cash 
phi does not plan to make further investments in its other non regulated businesses  and will focus on maintaining the earnings stream from its energy leveraged leases 
for a discussion of certain tax and accounting issues associated with pci s leveraged lease portfolio  see regulatory and other matters  herein 
business strategy phi s business strategy has three primary components achieving stable earnings in the power delivery business by focusing on the delivery of energy in a cost effective manner  while maintaining a high level of service reliability and customer satisfaction 
supplementing phi s utility earnings through complementary energy businesses that focus primarily on serving the competitive wholesale and retail markets in pjm 
these businesses use conservative risk management practices to manage their commodity price and volume exposures 
in addition  conectiv energy matches its portfolio of generation assets with its wholesale energy supply load 
strengthening phi s credit profile through active debt reduction efforts 
earnings overview year ended december  compared to year ended december  results phi s net income for the year ended december  was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share  for the year ended december  net income included the charges and credits set forth below which are presented net of tax and in millions of dollars

pepco holdings expects to fund these expenditures through internally generated cash from the power delivery businesses 
dividends pepco holdings annual dividend rate on its common stock is determined by the board of directors on a quarterly basis and takes into consideration  among other factors  current and possible future developments that may affect phi s income and cash flows 
phi s board of directors declared quarterly dividends of cents per share of common stock payable on march   june   september  and december  on january   pepco holdings declared a dividend on common stock of cents per share payable march   to shareholders of record march  under puhca  phi is prohibited  without sec approval  from paying dividends on its common stock from capital or unearned surplus 
phi generates no operating income of its own 
accordingly  its ability to pay dividends to its shareholders depends on dividends received from its subsidiaries 
in addition to their future financial performance  the ability of phi s direct and indirect subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to limits imposed by i state corporate and regulatory laws  which impose limitations on the funds that can be used to pay dividends and  in the case of regulatory laws  as applicable  may require the prior approval of the relevant utility regulatory commissions before dividends can be paid  ii puhca  which prohibits a subsidiary of a registered public utility holding company from paying a dividend out of capital or unearned surplus without the prior approval of the sec  iii the prior rights of holders of existing and futu re preferred stock  mortgage bonds and other long term debt issued by the subsidiaries  and any other restrictions imposed in connection with the incurrence of liabilities  and iv certain provisions of the charters of pepco  dpl and ace  which impose restrictions on payment of common stock dividends for the benefit of preferred stockholders 
pepco s articles of incorporation and dpl s certificate and articles of incorporation each contains provisions restricting the amount of dividends that can be paid on common stock when preferred stock is outstanding if the applicable company s capitalization ratio is less than 
for this purpose  the capitalization ratio is equal to i common stock capital plus surplus  divided by ii total capital including long term debt plus surplus 
in addition  dpl s certificate and articles of incorporation and ace s certificate of incorporation each provides that if preferred stock is outstanding  no dividends may be paid on common stock if  after payment  the applicable company s common stock capital plus surplus would be less than the involuntary liquidation value of the outstanding preferred stock 
currently  none of these charter restrictions limits the ability of pepco  dpl or ace to pay dividends 
pension funding pepco holdings has a noncontributory retirement plan the retirement plan that covers substantially all employees of pepco  conectiv and certain employees of other pepco holdings subsidiaries 
following the consummation of the acquisition of conectiv by pepco on august   the pepco general retirement plan and the conectiv retirement plan were merged into the retirement plan on december  the provisions and benefits of the merged retirement plan applicable to pepco employees are identical to those in the original pepco plan and the provisions and benefits applicable to conectiv employees are identical to those in the original conectiv plan 
as of the valuation  the retirement plan satisfied the minimum funding requirements of the employment retirement income security act of erisa without requiring any additional funding 
however  phi s funding policy with regard to the retirement plan is to maintain a funding level in excess of of its accumulated benefit obligation abo 
in and  phi made discretionary tax deductible cash contributions to the retirement plan in accordance with its funding policy 
in  the accumulated benefit obligation for the retirement plan increased over  due to the accrual of an additional year of service for participants and a decrease in the discount rate used to value the accumulated benefit obligation 
the change in the discount rate reflected the continued decline in interest rates in the retirement plan assets achieved returns in in excess of the levels assumed in the valuation 
as a result of the combination of these factors  in december phi contributed million all of which was funded by pepco to the retirement plan 
the contribution was made to ensure that under reasonable assumptions  the funding level at year end would be in excess of of the accrued benefit obligation 
in  phi contributed a total of million of which million was funded by pepco and million was funded by ace to the retirement plan 
assuming no changes to the current pension plan assumptions  phi projects no funding will be required under erisa in  however  phi may elect to make a discretionary tax deductible contribution  if required to main tain its assets in excess of its abo

pepco holdings has issued standby letters of credit of million on behalf of subsidiary operations related to conectiv energy s competitive energy activities and third party construction performance 
these standby letters of credit were put into place in order to allow the subsidiaries the flexibility needed to conduct business with counterparties without having to post substantial cash collateral 
while the exposure under these standby letters of credit is million  pepco holdings does not expect to fund the full amount 
subsidiaries of pepco holdings and conectiv have guaranteed residual values in excess of fair value related to certain equipment and fleet vehicles held through lease agreements 
as of december   obligations under the guarantees were approximately million 
assets leased under agreements subject to residual value guarantees are typically for periods ranging from years to years 
historically  payments under the guarantee have not been made by the guarantor as  under normal conditions  the contract runs to full term at which time the residual value is minimal 
as such  pepco holdings believes the likelihood of requiring payment under the guarantee is remote 
pepco holdings has issued a guarantee on behalf of a subsidiary s unconsolidated investment in a limited liability company for repayment of borrowings under a loan agreement of approximately million 
conectiv has performance obligations of million relating to obligations to third party suppliers of equipment

as of december   the guarantees cover the remaining million in rental obligations 
pepco holdings and certain of its subsidiaries have entered into various indemnification agreements related to purchase and sale agreements and other types of contractual agreements with vendors and other third parties 
these indemnification agreements typically cover environmental  tax  litigation and other matters  as well as breaches of representations  warranties and covenants set forth in the agreements 
typically  claims may be made by third parties under these indemnification agreements over various periods of time depending on the nature of the claim 
the maximum potential exposure under these indemnification agreements can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount depending on the nature of the claim and the particular transaction 
the total maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification agreements is not estimable due to several factors  including uncertainty as to whether or when claims may be made under these indemnities

contractual arrangements with credit rating triggers or margining rights under certain contractual arrangements entered into by phi s subsidiaries in connection with competitive energy and other transactions  the affected company may be required to provide cash collateral or letters of credit as security for its contractual obligations if the credit ratings of the applicable company are downgraded one or more levels 
in the event of a downgrade  the amount required to be posted would depend on the amount of the underlying contractual obligation existing at the time of the downgrade 
as of december   a one level downgrade in the credit rating of phi and all of its affected subsidiaries would have required phi and such subsidiaries to provide aggregate cash collateral or letters of credit of approximately up to million 
an additional approximately million of aggregate cash collateral or letters of credit would have been required in the event of subsequent downgrades to below investment grad e 
phi and its utility subsidiaries maintain adequate short term funding sources in the event the additional collateral or letters of credit are required 
see sources of capital short term funding sources 
many of the contractual arrangements entered into by phi s subsidiaries in connection with competitive energy activities include margining rights pursuant to which the phi subsidiary or a counterparty may request collateral if the market value of the contractual obligations reaches levels that are in excess of the credit thresholds established in the applicable arrangements 
pursuant to these margining rights  the affected phi subsidiary may receive  or be required to post  collateral due to energy price movements 
as of december   pepco holdings subsidiaries engaged in competitive energy activities were in receipt of a net holder of cash collateral in the amount of million in connection with their competitive energy activities 
environmental remediation obligations phi s accrued liabilities as of december  include approximately million  of which million is expected to be incurred in  for potential cleanup and other costs related to sites at which an operating subsidiary is a prp  is alleged to be a third party contributor  or has made a decision to clean up contamination on its own property 
for information regarding projected expenditures for environmental control facilities  see business environmental matters 
the principal environmental remediation obligations as of december   were million  of which million is expected to be incurred in  payable by dpl in accordance with a consent agreement reached with dnrec during  for remediation  site restoration  natural resource damage compensatory projects and other costs associated with environmental contamination that resulted from an oil release at the indian river power plant 
that plant was sold on june  ace s planned sale of the bl england and deepwater generating facilities triggered the applicability of the new jersey industrial site recovery act requiring remediation at these facilities 
when the prospective purchaser of these generating facilities terminated the agreement of sale in accordance with the agreement s termination provisions  ace decided to continue the environmental investigation process at these facilities 
ace and conectiv energy to which ace transferred the deepwater generating facility on february  are continuing the investigation with oversight from njdep 
ace anticipates that it will incur costs of approximately million in environmental remediation costs  of which  is expected to be incurred in  associated with the bl england generating facility 
conectiv energy anticipates that it will incur approximately million in environmental remediation costs  of which  is expected to be incurred in  associated with the deepwater generating facility 
as a result of a december  oil spill at the bl england generating facility   was accrued in december for estimated clean up  remediation  restoration  and potential njdep natural resources damage assessments 
as of december   ace has spent  for clean up  remediation  and restoration 
the remaining liability of  is anticipated to cover future restoration efforts to be monitored for three years beginning in may the njdep natural resource damage assessments  if any  have not been determined at this time 
dpl expects to incur costs of approximately million in connection with the wilmington coal gas site to remediate residual material from the historical operation of a manufactured gas plant 
approximately million is expected to be incurred in pepco expects to incur approximately million for long term monitoring in connection with pepco s swanson creek oil release  of which  is expected to be incurred in sources of capital pepco holdings sources to meet its long term funding needs  such as capital expenditures  dividends  and new investments  and its short term funding needs  such as working capital and the temporary funding of long term funding needs  include internally generated funds  securities issuances and bank financing under new or existing facilities 
phi s ability to generate funds from its operations and to access capital and credit markets is subject to risks and uncertainties 
see risk factors for a discussion of important factors that may impact these sources of capital 
internally generated cash the primary source of pepco holdings internally generated funds is the cash flow generated by its regulated utility subsidiaries in the power delivery business 
additional sources of funds include cash flow generated from its non regulated subsidiaries and the sale of non core assets 
short term funding sources pepco holdings and its regulated utility subsidiaries have traditionally used a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs  such as commercial paper  short term notes and bank lines of credit 
proceeds from short term borrowings are used primarily to meet working capital needs but may also be used to temporarily fund long term capital requirements 
pepco holdings maintains an ongoing commercial paper program of up to million 
pepco  dpl  and ace have ongoing commercial paper programs of up to million  up to million  and up to million  respectively 
the commercial paper notes can be issued with maturities up to days from the date of issue 
in july  pepco holdings  pepco  dpl and ace entered into a five year credit agreement with an aggregate borrowing limit of million 
this agreement replaced a million day credit agreement that was entered into on july  the respective companies also are parties to a three year credit agreement that was entered into in july and terminates in july with an aggregate borrowing limit of million 
pepco holdings credit limit under these facilities is million  and the credit limit of each of pepco  dpl and ace under these facilities is the lower of million and the maximum amount of short term debt authorized by the appropriate state commission  except that the aggregate amount of credit utilized by pepco  dpl and ace at any given time under these facilities may not exceed million 
funds borrowed under these facilities are available for general corporate purposes 
either credit facility also can be used as credit support for the commercial paper programs of the respective companies 
the three year and five year credit agreements contain customary financial and other covenants that  if not satisfied  could result in the acceleration of repayment obligations under the agreements or restrict the ability of the companies to borrow under the agreements 
among these covenants is the requirement that each borrowing company maintain a ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization of or less  computed in accordance with the terms of the credit agreements 
as of december   the applicable ratios for pepco holdings  pepco  dpl and ace were   and  respectively 
the credit agreements also contain a number of customary events of default that could result in the acceleration of repayment obligations under the agreements  including i the failure of any borrowing company or any of its significant subsidiaries to pay when due  or the acceleration of  certain indebtedness under other borrowing arrangements  ii certain bankruptcy events  judgments or decrees against any borrowing company or its significant subsidiaries  and iii a change in control as defined in the credit agreements of pepco holdings or the failure of pepco holdings to own all of the voting stock of pepco  dpl and ace 
in december  phi entered into a million term loan due december  with a bank 
the loan is variable rate  based on libor 
phi has the option to select interest periods based on one  two  three or six month libor rates 
the covenants in the agreement are substantially consistent with those found in the three year and five year credit agreements 
proceeds from the loan were used to pay down commercial paper 
long term funding sources the sources of long term funding for phi and its subsidiaries are the issuance of debt and equity securities and borrowing under long term credit agreements 
proceeds from long term financings are used primarily to fund long term capital requirements  such as capital expenditures and new investments  and to refund or refinance existing securities 
puhca restrictions because pepco holdings is a public utility holding company registered under the public utility holding company act puhca  it must obtain sec approval to issue securities 
puhca also prohibits pepco holdings from borrowing from its subsidiaries 
under an sec financing order dated july  the financing order  pepco holdings is authorized to issue equity  preferred securities and debt securities in an aggregate amount not to exceed billion through an authorization period ending june   subject to a ceiling on the effective cost of these funds 
pepco holdings is also authorized to enter into guarantees to third parties or otherwise provide credit support with respect to obligations of its subsidiaries for up to billion 
of this amount  only billion may be on behalf of subsidiaries engaged in energy marketing activities 
pepco holdings may issue common stock to satisfy its obligations under its shareholder dividend reinvestment plan and various employee benefit plans 
under the financing order  pepco holdings is limited to issuing no more than an aggregate of million shares of common stock under its shareholder dividend reinvestment plan and employee benefit plans during the period ending june  the financing order requires that  in order to issue debt or equity securities  including commercial paper  pepco holdings must maintain a ratio of common stock equity to total capitalization consisting of common stock  preferred stock  if any  long term debt and short term debt of at least percent 
at december   pepco holdings common equity ratio for purposes of the financing order was percent 
the financing order also requires that all rated securities issued by pepco holdings be rated investment grade by at least one nationally recognized rating agency 
accordingly  if pepco holdings common equity ratio were less than percent or if no nationally recognized rating agency rated a security investment grade  pepco holdings could not issue the security without first obtaining an amendment to the financing order from the sec 
if an amendment to the financing order is required to enable pepco holdings or any of its subsidiaries to effect a financing  there is no certainty that such an amendment could be obtained or as to the timing of sec action 
the failure to obtain timely relief from the sec  in such circumstances  could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of pepco holdings and its subsidiaries 
the foregoing financing limitations also generally apply to pepco  dpl  ace and certain other pepco holdings subsidiaries 
on february   phi and its subsidiaries filed an application with the sec for authorization to engage in various financing activities described therein for an authorization period through june  money pool under the july  financing order  pepco holdings has received sec authorization under puhca to establish the pepco holdings system money pool 
the money pool is a cash management mechanism used by pepco holdings to manage the short term investment and borrowing requirements of the phi subsidiaries that participate in the money pool 
pepco holdings may invest in but not borrow from the money pool 
eligible subsidiaries with surplus cash may deposit those funds in the money pool 
deposits in the money pool are guaranteed by pepco holdings 
eligible subsidiaries with cash requirements may borrow from the money pool 
borrowings from the money pool are unsecured 
depositors in the money pool receive  and borrowers from the money pool pay  an interest rate based primarily on pepco holdings short term borrowing rate 
pepco holdings deposits funds in the money pool to the extent that the pool has insufficient funds to meet the borrowin g needs of its participants  which may require pepco holdings to borrow funds for deposit from external sources 
consequently  pepco holdings external borrowing requirements fluctuate based on the amount of funds required to be deposited in the money pool 
regulatory and other matters relationship with mirant corporation in  pepco sold substantially all of its electricity generation assets to mirant corporation  formerly southern energy  inc  pursuant to an asset purchase and sale agreement 
as part of the asset purchase and sale agreement  pepco entered into several ongoing contractual arrangements with mirant and certain of its subsidiaries collectively  mirant 
on july   mirant corporation and most of its subsidiaries filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court for the northern district of texas the bankruptcy court 
depending on the outcome of the matters discussed below  the mirant bankruptcy could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of pepco holdings and pepco 
however  management currently believes that pepco holdings and pepco currently have sufficient cash  cash flow and borrowing capacity under their credit facilities and in the capital markets to be able to satisfy any additional cash requirements that have arisen or may arise due to the mirant bankruptcy 
accordingly  management does not anticipate that the mirant bankruptcy will impair the ability of pepco holdings or pepco to fulfill their contractual obligations or to fund projected capital expenditures 
on this basis  management currently does not believe that the mirant bankruptcy will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of either company 
transition power agreements as part of the asset purchase and sale agreement  pepco and mirant entered into transition power agreements for maryland and the district of columbia  respectively collectively  the tpas 
under these agreements  mirant was obligated to supply pepco with all of the capacity and energy needed to fulfill its standard offer service obligations in maryland through june and its standard offer service obligations in the district of columbia through january  to avoid the potential rejection of the tpas  pepco and mirant entered into an amended settlement agreement and release dated as of october  the settlement agreement pursuant to which mirant assumed both of the tpas and the terms of the tpas were modified 
the settlement agreement also provided that pepco has an allowed  pre petition general unsecured claim against mirant corporation in the amount of million the pepco tpa claim 
pepco has also asserted the pepco tpa claim against other mirant entities that pepco believes are liable to pepco under the terms of the asset purchase and sale agreement s assignment and assumption agreement the assignment agreement 
under the assignment agreement  pepco believes that each of the mirant entities assumed and agreed to discharge certain liabilities and obligations of pepco as defined in the asset purchase and sale agreement 
mirant has filed objections to these claims 
under the current plan of reorganization filed by the mirant entities with the bankruptcy court  certain mirant entities other than mirant corporation would pay significantly higher portions of the claims of their creditors than would mirant corporation 
the amount that pepco will be able to recover from the mirant bankruptcy estate with respect to the pepco tpa claim will depend on the amount of assets available for distribution to creditors of the mirant entities that are found to be liable for the pepco tpa claim 
power purchase agreements under agreements with firstenergy corp  formerly ohio edison firstenergy  and allegheny energy  inc  both entered into in  pepco is obligated to purchase from firstenergy megawatts of capacity and energy annually through december the firstenergy ppa 
under an agreement with panda  entered into in  pepco is obligated to purchase from panda megawatts of capacity and energy annually through the panda ppa 
in each case  the purchase price is substantially in excess of current market price 
as a part of the asset purchase and sale agreement  pepco entered into a back to back arrangement with mirant 
under this arrangement  mirant is obligated  among other things  to purchase from pepco the capacity and energy that pepco is obligated to purchase under the firstenergy ppa and the panda ppa at a price equal to the price pepco is obligated to pay under the firstenergy ppa and the panda ppa the ppa related oblig ations 
pepco pre petition claims when mirant filed its bankruptcy petition on july   mirant had unpaid obligations to pepco of approximately million  consisting primarily of payments due to pepco in respect of the ppa related obligations the mirant pre petition obligations 
the mirant pre petition obligations constitute part of the indebtedness for which mirant is seeking relief in its bankruptcy proceeding 
pepco has filed proofs of claim in the mirant bankruptcy proceeding in the amount of approximately million to recover this indebtedness  however  the amount of pepco s recovery  if any  is uncertain 
the million difference between mirant s unpaid obligation to pepco and the million proofs of claim primarily represents a tpa settlement adjustment which is included in the million proofs of claim filed by pepco against the mirant debtors in respect of the pepco tpa claim 
in view of this uncertainty  pepco  in the third quarter of  expen sed million to establish a reserve against the million receivable from mirant 
in january  pepco paid approximately million to panda in settlement of certain billing disputes under the panda ppa that related to periods after the sale of pepco s generation assets to mirant 
pepco believes that under the terms of the asset purchase and sale agreement  mirant is obligated to reimburse pepco for the settlement payment 
accordingly  in the first quarter of  pepco increased the amount of the receivable due from mirant by approximately million and amended its proofs of claim to include this amount 
pepco currently estimates that the million expensed in the third quarter of represents the portion of the entire million receivable unlikely to be recovered in bankruptcy  and no additional reserve has been established for the million increase in the receivable 
the amount expensed represents pepco s estimate of the possible outcome in bankruptcy  although the amou nt ultimately recovered could be higher or lower 
mirant s attempt to reject the ppa related obligations on august   mirant filed with the bankruptcy court a motion seeking authorization to reject its ppa related obligations 
upon motions filed with the us district court for the northern district of texas the district court by pepco and ferc  in october  the district court withdrew jurisdiction over the rejection proceedings from the bankruptcy court 
in december  the district court denied mirant s motion to reject the ppa related obligations on jurisdictional grounds 
the district court s decision was appealed by mirant and the official committee of unsecured creditors of mirant corporation the creditors committee to the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit the court of appeals 
on august   the court of appeals remanded the case to the district court saying that the district court has jurisdiction to rule on the merits of mirant s rejection motion  suggesting that in doing so the court apply a more rigorous standard than the business judgment rule usually applied by bankruptcy courts in ruling on rejection motions 
on december   the district court issued an order again denying mirant s motion to reject the ppa related obligations 
the district court found that the ppa related obligations are not severable from the asset purchase and sale agreement and that the asset purchase and sale agreement cannot be rejected in part  as mirant was seeking to do 
on december  the creditors committee appealed the district court s order to the court of appeals  and on december   mirant also appealed the district court s order 
as more fully discussed below  mirant had been making regular periodic payments in respect of the ppa related obligations 
on december   mirant filed a notice with the bankruptcy court that it was suspending payments to pepco in respect of the ppa related obligations 
on december   mirant failed to make a payment of approximately million due to pepco for the period november  to november  mirant failed to make that payment 
on december   pepco received a payment of approximately million from mirant  which according to mirant represented the market value of the power for which payment was due on december mirant has informed pepco that it intends to continue to pay the market value  but not the above market portion  of the power purchased under the ppa related obligations 
pepco disagrees with mirant s assertion that it need only pay the market value and believes that the amount repr esenting the market value calculated by mirant is insufficient 
on january   mirant made a approximately million  which  according to mirant  includes the payment for the firstenergy ppa for december and includes the december tpa revenue in the amount of  the tpa costs in the amount of  and an allocated share of 
firstenergy s 
ppa bill credits charges in the amount of 
pepco disputes mirant s contention that the amount paid reflects the full amount due pepco under these agreements for the applicable periods 
as of march   mirant has withheld payment of approximately million due to pepco under the ppa related obligations 
on january   mirant filed in the bankruptcy court a motion seeking to reject certain of its ongoing obligations under the asset purchase and sale agreement  including the ppa related obligations 
on march  as amended by order dated march   the district court granted pepco s motion to withdraw jurisdiction over the asset purchase and sale agreement rejection proceedings from the bankruptcy court 
in addition  the district court ordered mirant to pay on march   all past due unpaid amounts under the ppa related obligations 
mirant has filed a motion for reconsideration and a stay of the march  order 
pepco is exercising all available legal remedies and vigorously opposing mirant s attempt to reject the ppa related obligations and other obligations under the asset purchase and sale agreement in order to protect the interests of its customers and shareholders 
while pepco believes that it has substantial legal bases to oppose the attempt to reject the agreements  the outcome of mirant s efforts to reject the ppa related obligations is uncertain 
if mirant ultimately is successful in rejecting the ppa related obligations  pepco could be required to repay to mirant  for the period beginning on the effective date of the rejection which date could be prior to the date of the court s order and possibly as early as september  and ending on the date mirant is entitled to cease its purchases of energy and capacity from pepco  all amounts paid by mirant to pepco in respect of the ppa related obligations  less an amount equal to the price at which mirant resold the purchased energy and capacity 
pepco estimates that the amount it could be required to repay to mirant in the unlikely event that september   is determined to be the effective date of rejection  is approximately million as of march  assuming mirant continues to withhold unpaid amounts of approximately million as of march  mirant has also indicated to the bankruptcy court that it will move to require pepco to disgorge all amounts paid by mirant to pepco in respect of the ppa related obligations  less an amount equal to the price at which mirant resold the purchased energy and capacity  for the period july  the date on which mirant filed its bankruptcy petition through rejection  if approved  on the theory that mirant did not receive value for those payments 
pepco estimates that the amount it would be required to repay to mirant on the disgorgement theory  in addition to the amounts described above  is approximately million 
any repayment by pepco of amounts paid by mirant would entitle pepco to file a claim against the bankruptcy estate in an amount equal to the amount repaid 
pepco believes that  to the extent such amounts were not recovered from the mirant bankruptcy estate  they would be recoverable as stranded costs from customers through distribution rates as described below 
the following are estimates prepared by pepco of its potential future exposure if mirant s attempt to reject the ppa related obligations ultimately is successful 
these estimates are based in part on current market prices and forward price estimates for energy and capacity  and do not include financing costs  all of which could be subject to significant fluctuation 
the estimates assume no recovery from the mirant bankruptcy estate and no regulatory recovery  either of which would mitigate the effect of the estimated loss 
pepco does not consider it realistic to assume that there will be no such recoveries 
based on these assumptions  pepco estimates that its pre tax exposure as of march   representing the loss of the future benefit of the ppa related obligations to pepco  is as follows if pepco were required to purchase capacity and energy from firstenergy commencing as of march   at the rates provided in the ppa with an average price per kilowatt hour of approximately cents and resold the capacity and energy at market rates projected  given the characteristics of the firstenergy ppa  to be approximately cents per kilowatt hour  pepco estimates that it would cost approximately million for the remainder of  the final year of the firstenergy ppa 
if pepco were required to purchase capacity and energy from panda commencing as of march   at the rates provided in the ppa with an average price per kilowatt hour of approximately cents  and resold the capacity and energy at market rates projected  given the characteristics of the panda ppa  to be approximately cents per kilowatt hour  pepco estimates that it would cost approximately million for the remainder of  approximately million in and  and approximately million to million annually thereafter through the contract termination date 
the ability of pepco to recover from the mirant bankruptcy estate in respect to the mirant pre petition obligations and damages if the ppa related obligations are successfully rejected will depend on whether pepco s claims are allowed  the amount of assets available for distribution to the creditors of the mirant companies determined to be liable for those claims  and pepco s priority relative to other creditors 
at the current stage of the bankruptcy proceeding  there is insufficient information to determine the amount  if any  that pepco might be able to recover from the mirant bankruptcy estate  whether the recovery would be in cash or another form of payment  or the timing of any recovery 
if mirant ultimately is successful in rejecting the ppa related obligations and pepco s full claim is not recovered from the mirant bankruptcy estate  pepco may seek authority from the mpsc and the dcpsc to recover its additional costs 
pepco is committed to working with its regulatory authorities to achieve a result that is appropriate for its shareholders and customers 
under the provisions of the settlement agreements approved by the mpsc and the dcpsc in the deregulation proceedings in which pepco agreed to divest its generation assets under certain conditions  the ppas were to become assets of pepco s distribution business if they could not be sold 
pepco believes that  if mirant ultimately is successful in rejecting the ppa related obligations  these provisions would allow the stranded costs of the ppas that are not recovered from the mirant bankruptcy estate to be recovered from pepco s customers through its distribution rates 
if pe pco s interpretation of the settlement agreements is confirmed  pepco expects to be able to establish the amount of its anticipated recovery as a regulatory asset 
however  there is no assurance that pepco s interpretation of the settlement agreements would be confirmed by the respective public service commissions 
if the ppa related obligations are successfully rejected  and there is no regulatory recovery  pepco will incur a loss 
however  the accounting treatment of such a loss depends on a number of legal and regulatory factors  and is not determinable at this time 
the smeco agreement as a term of the asset purchase and sale agreement  pepco assigned to mirant a facility and capacity agreement with southern maryland electric cooperative  inc smeco under which pepco was obligated to purchase the capacity of an megawatt combustion turbine installed and owned by smeco at a former pepco generating facility the smeco agreement 
the smeco agreement expires in and contemplates a monthly payment to smeco of approximately 
million 
pepco is responsible to smeco for the performance of the smeco agreement if mirant fails to perform its obligations thereunder 
at this time  mirant continues to make post petition payments due to smeco 
on march   mirant filed a complaint with the bankruptcy court seeking a declaratory judgment that the facility and capacity credit agreement is an unexpired lease of non residential real property rather than an executory contract and that if mirant were to successfully reject the agreement  any claim against the bankruptcy estate for damages made by smeco or by pepco as subrogee would be subject to the provisions of the bankruptcy code that limit the recovery of rejection damages by lessors 
pepco believes that there is no reasonable factual or legal basis to support mirant s contention that the smeco agreement is a lease of real property 
litigation continues and the outcome of this proceeding cannot be predicted 
federal tax treatment of cross border leases pci maintains a portfolio of cross border energy sale leaseback transactions  which as of december  had a book value of approximately billion 
the american jobs creation act of imposed new passive loss limitation rules that apply prospectively to leases including cross border leases entered into after march  with tax indifferent parties ie  municipalities and tax exempt or governmental entities 
all of pci s cross border energy leases are with tax indifferent parties and were entered into prior to although this legislation is prospective in nature and does not affect pci s existing cross border energy leases  it does not prohibit the irs from challenging prior leasing transactions 
in this regard  on february   the treasury department and irs issued notice informing taxpayers that the irs intends to challenge on various grounds the purported tax benefits claimed by taxpayers enteri ng into certain sale leaseback transactions with tax indifferent parties  including those entered into on or prior to march  the notice 
pci s cross border energy leases are similar to those sale leaseback transactions described in the notice 
pci s leases are currently under examination by the irs as part of the normal phi tax audit 
phi believes there is a substantial likelihood that the irs will challenge the tax benefits realized from interest and depreciation deductions claimed by pci with respect to these leases  or the timing of these benefits  for the years through the tax benefits claimed by pci for these years were approximately million 
the ultimate outcome of this issue is uncertain  however  if the irs prevails  phi would be subject to additional taxes  along with interest and possibly penalties on the additional taxes  which could have a material adverse effect on phi s results of operations and cash flow 
phi believes that its tax position related to these transactions was proper based on applicable statutes  regulations and case law  and intends to contest any adjustments proposed by the irs  however  there is no assurance that phi s position will prevail 
under sfas no 
 as currently interpreted  a deferral of tax benefits that does not change the total estimated net income from phi s leases does not require an adjustment to the book value of the leases 
however  if the irs were to disallow  rather than require the deferral of  certain tax deductions related to phi s leases  phi would be required to adjust the book value of the leases and record a charge to earnings equal to the repricing impact of the disallowed deductions 
such a charge to earnings  if required  is likely to have a material adverse effect on phi s results of operations for the period in which the charge is recorded 
in recent deliberations  the financial accounting standards board fasb has determined that a change in the timing of tax benefits also should require a repricing of the lease and an adjustment to the book value of a lease 
under this interpretation  a material change in the timing of cash flows under phi s cross border leases as the result of a settlement with the irs also would require an adjustment to the book value 
phi understands that the fasb intends to publish this guidance for comment in the near future to become effective at the end of if adopted  the application of this guidance could result in a material adverse effect on phi s results of operations even if the resolution is limited to a deferral of the tax benefits realized by pci from its leases 
rate proceedings in february  ace filed a petition with the njbpu to increase its electric distribution rates and its regulatory asset recovery charge rarc in new jersey 
the petition was based on actual data for the nine months ended september   and forecasted data for the three months ended december  and sought an overall rate increase of approximately million  consisting of an approximately million increase in electricity distribution rates and million for recovery of regulatory assets through the rarc 
in october  ace filed an update supporting an overall rate increase of approximately million  consisting of a million increase in electricity distribution rates and a rarc of million 
this petition was ace s first increase request for electric distribution rates since the requested increase would apply to all rate schedules in ace s tariff 
the ratepayer advocate filed testimony on january   proposing an annual rate decrease of million 
intervenor groups representing industrial users and local generators filed testimony that did not take a position with respect to an overall rate change but their proposals  if implemented  would affect the way in which an overall rate increase or decrease would be applied to the particular rates under which they receive service 
ace s rebuttal testimony  filed in february  made some changes to its october filing and proposed an overall rate increase of approximately million  consisting of a million increase in distribution rates and a million increase in the rarc 
hearings were held before an administrative law judge in late march  early april and may at the hearing held in april  the ratepayer advocate proposed an annual rate decrease of million  modifying its earlier proposal that rates be decreased by million annually 
the ratepayer advocate and staff of the njbpu filed their briefs in this proceeding in august the ratepayer advocate s brief supported its earlier proposal of an annual rate decrease of million 
the staff s brief  however  stated for the first time its position calling for an overall decrease of million 
reply briefs were filed on august  settlement discussions between ace  the njbpu staff and the ratepayer advocate have been ongoing 
on december   the njbpu issued an order also consolidating outstanding issues from several other proceedings into the base rate case proceeding 
on december   ace filed a motion for reconsideration in which it suggested that these issues be dealt with in a phase ii to the base rate case to address the outstanding issues identified in the december  order 
after discussion with the parties to the base rate case  it was agreed that a phase ii to the base rate case to address these issues  along with the million of deferred restructuring costs previously transferred into the base rate case  would be initiated in april on april   ace filed testimony with the njbpu initiating a phase ii to the base rate proceeding described above 
the parties to this case have been actively engaged in settlement discussions in conjunction with settlement of phase i issues 
on august   ace filed requests with the njbpu proposing changes to its transition bond charge  its market transition charge tax rate  and its bgs reconciliation charges 
the net impact of these rate changes is to decrease ace s annual revenues by approximately 
all of these rate changes were implemented on october  on october   dpl submitted its annual gas cost rate gcr filing to the dpsc 
in its filing  dpl sought to increase its gcr by approximately in anticipation of increasing natural gas commodity costs 
the gcr  which permits dpl to recover its procurement gas costs through customer rates  became effective november  and is subject to refund pending evidentiary hearings 
in addition  on november   dpl filed a supplemental filing seeking approval to further increase gcr rates by an additional effective december  the additional gcr increase became effective december  and is subject to refund pending evidentiary hearings 
the dpsc staff and the division of public advocate filed their testimony on march  recommending full approval of the gcr changes being sought by dpl  including the revisions to the tariff in the original and supplemental filings 
a final order addressing both the nov ember and december increases is expected in the spring of on february   dpl filed with the dpsc for a change in electric ancillary service rates that would have an aggregate effect of increasing annual delaware electric revenues by million or 
this filing was prompted by the increasing ancillary service costs charged to dpl by pjm 
the proposed rates went into effect on march   subject to refund 
on june   the dpsc approved a settlement agreement that provided for an increase having an aggregate effect of increasing annual delaware electric revenues by million  or  with rates effective june  the approved increase was slightly less than the proposed increase that went into effect on march  as part of the settlement  the resulting estimated over collection of  was given by dpl to the state of delaware low income fund administered by the delaware department of human services on july  in compliance with the settlement approved by the mpsc in connection with the merger of pepco and conectiv  on december   dpl and pepco submitted testimony and supporting schedules to review and reset if necessary its electricity distribution rates in maryland to be effective july   when the then current distribution rate freeze caps ended 
dpl s filing demonstrated that it was in an under earning situation and  as allowed in the merger settlement  dpl requested that a temporary rate reduction implemented on july  for non residential customers be terminated effective july  dpl estimated that the termination of the rate reduction would increase its annual revenues by approximately million 
a settlement reached between the parties allowing for this million increase to be effective july  was approved by the mpsc in order no 
with limited exceptions  dpl cannot increase its distribution rates until january  pepco s filing demonstrated that it also was in an under earning situation 
however the merger settlement provided that pepco s distribution rates after july  could only remain the same or be decreased 
with limited exceptions  pepco cannot increase its distribution rates until january  in an order dated july  the mpsc affirmed the hearing examiner s recommendation that no rate decrease was warranted at that time 
on july   pepco filed a distribution rate review case with the dcpsc as required by the terms of the pepco conectiv merger settlement approved by the dcpsc 
this case will determine whether pepco s distribution rates will be decreased 
in accordance with the terms of the merger settlement  pepco s distribution rates cannot be increased as a result of the case 
on november   the dcpsc issued an order that designated the issues to be considered in the case and set the hearing schedule 
on december   pepco filed supplemental direct testimony addressing the dcpsc designated issues 
pepco s filings indicate that no rate decrease is warranted 
on march   the dcpsc issued an order granting a joint motion filed on march   on behalf of pepco and several other parties in the case to suspend the procedural schedule to allow the parties to focus on completing settlement discussions 
in the joint motion  the movin g parties informed the dcpsc that they had agreed in principle to settlement provisions that would resolve all issues in the proceeding and that a settlement agreement could be filed in the near future 
restructuring deferral pursuant to a july summary order issued by the njbpu under the new jersey electric discount and energy competition act edeca which was subsequently affirmed by a final decision and order issued in march  ace was obligated to provide basic generation service bgs from august  to at least july  to retail electricity customers in ace s service territory who did not choose a competitive energy supplier 
the order allowed ace to recover through customer rates certain costs incurred in providing bgs 
ace s obligation to provide bgs was subsequently extended to july  at the allowed rates  for the period august  through july   ace s aggregate allowed costs exceeded its aggregate revenues from supplying bgs 
these under recovered costs were partially offset by a million deferred energy cost liability existing as of july  leac liability that was related to ace s levelized ener gy adjustment clause and ace s demand side management programs 
ace established a regulatory asset in an amount equal to the balance 
in august  ace filed a petition with the njbpu for the recovery of approximately million in actual and projected deferred costs relating to the provision of bgs and other restructuring related costs incurred by ace over the four year period august  through july  the deferred balance was net of the million offset for the leac liability 
the petition also requested that ace s rates be reset as of august  so that there would be no under recovery of costs embedded in the rates on or after that date 
the increase sought represented an overall annual increase in electric rates and was in addition to the base rate increase discussed above 
ace s recovery of the deferred costs is subject to review and approval by the njbpu in accordance with edeca 
in july  the njbpu issued a summary order  which i permitted ace to begin collecting a portion of the deferred costs and reset rates to recover on going costs incurred as a result of edeca  ii approved the recovery of million of the deferred balance over a ten year amortization period beginning august   iii transferred to ace s pending base rate case for further consideration approximately million of the deferred balance  and iv estimated the overall deferral balance as of july  at million  of which million was disallowed recovery by ace 
in july  the njbpu issued its final order in the restructuring deferral proceeding 
the final order did not modify the amount of the disallowances set forth in the july summary order  but did provide a much more detailed analysis of evidence and other information relied on by the njbpu as justification for the disallowances 
ace believes the record does not justify the level of disallowance imposed by the njbpu 
in august  ace filed with the appellate division of the superior court of new jersey  which hears appeals of new jersey administrative agencies  including the njbpu  a notice of appeal related to the july final order 
ace cannot predict the outcome of this appeal 
divestiture cases district of columbia final briefs on pepco s district of columbia divestiture proceeds sharing application were filed on july  following an evidentiary hearing in june that application was filed to implement a provision of pepco s dcpsc approved divestiture settlement that provided for a sharing of any net proceeds from the sale of pepco s generation related assets 
one of the principal issues in the case is whether pepco should be required to share with customers the excess deferred income taxes edit and accumulated deferred investment tax credits aditc associated with the sold assets and  if so  whether such sharing would violate the normalization provisions of the internal revenue code and its implementing regulations 
the district of columbia allocated portions of edit and aditc associated with the divested generation assets were approximately million and million  respectively 
on march   the internal revenue s ervice irs issued a notice of proposed rulemaking nopr that is relevant to that principal issue 
comments on the nopr were filed by several parties on june   and the irs held a public hearing on june  as a result of the nopr  three of the parties in the divestiture case filed comments with the dcpsc urging the dcpsc to decide the tax issues now on the basis of the proposed rule 
pepco filed comments with the dcpsc in reply to those comments  in which pepco stated that the courts have held and the irs has stated that proposed rules are not authoritative and that no decision should be issued on the basis of proposed rules 
instead  pepco argued that the only prudent course of action is for the dcpsc to await the issuance of final regulations relating to the tax issues and then allow the parties to file supplemental briefs on the tax issues 
pepco cannot predict whether the irs will adopt the regulations as proposed  make changes before issuing final regulations or decide not to adopt regulations 
other issues in the proceeding deal with the treatment of internal costs and cost allocations as deductions from the gross proceeds of the divestiture 
pepco believes that a sharing of edit and aditc would violate the normalization rules 
if pepco were required to share edit and aditc and  as a result  the normalization rules were violated  pepco would be unable to use accelerated depreciation on district of columbia allocated or assigned property 
pepco  in addition to sharing with customers the generation related aditc balance  would have to pay to the irs an amount equal to pepco s million district of columbia jurisdictional generation related aditc balance as well as its district of columbia jurisdictional transmission and distribution related aditc balance as of the later of the date a dcpsc order is issued and all rights to appeal have been exhausted or lapsed  or the date the dcpsc order becomes operative 
as of december   the district of columbia jurisdictional transmission and distribution related aditc balance was approximately million 
pepco believes that its calculation of the district of columbia customers share of divestiture proceeds is correct 
however  depending on the ultimate outcome of this proceeding  pepco could be required to make additional gain sharing payments to dc customers  including the payments described above related to edit and aditc 
such additional payments which  other than the edit and aditc related payments  cannot be estimated would be charged to expense in the quarter and year in which a final decision is rendered and could have a material adverse effect on pepco s and phi s results of operations for those periods 
however  neither phi nor pepco believes that additional gain sharing payments  if any  or the aditc related payments to the irs  if required  would have a material adverse impact on its financial condition 
it is uncertain when the dcpsc will issue a decision 
maryland pepco filed its divestiture proceeds plan application in maryland in april reply briefs were filed in may the principal issue in the maryland case is the same edit and aditc sharing issue that was raised in the dc case 
as of december   the maryland allocated portions of edit and aditc associated with the divested generation assets were approximately million and million  respectively 
other issues deal with the treatment of certain costs as deductions from the gross proceeds of the divestiture 
in november  the hearing examiner in the maryland proceeding issued a proposed order that concluded that pepco s maryland divestiture settlement agreement provided for a sharing between pepco and customers of the edit and aditc associated with the sold assets 
pepco believes that such a sharing would violate the normalization rules and would result in pepco s inability to use accelerated depreciation on maryland allocated or assigned property 
if the proposed order is affirmed  pepco would have to share with its maryland customers  on an approximately basis  the maryland allocated portion of the generation related edit  ie  million  and the generation related aditc 
if such sharing were to violate the normalization rules  pepco  in addition to sharing with customers an amount equal to approximately percent of the generation related aditc balance  would be unable to use accelerated depreciation on maryland allocated or assigned property 
furthermore  pepco would have to pay to the irs an amount equal to pepco s million maryland jurisdictional generation related aditc balance  as well as its maryland retail jurisdictional aditc transmission and distribution related balance as of the later of the date a mpsc order is issued and all rights to appeal have been exhausted or lapsed  or the date the mpsc order becomes operative 
as of december   the maryland retail jurisdiction al transmission and distribution related aditc balance was approximately million 
the hearing examiner decided all other issues in favor of pepco  except that only one half of the severance payments that pepco included in its calculation of corporate reorganization costs should be deducted from the sales proceeds before sharing of the net gain between pepco and customers 
see also the disclosure above under divestiture cases district of columbia regarding the march  irs nopr 
under maryland law  if the proposed order is appealed to the mpsc  the proposed order is not a final  binding order of the mpsc and further action by the mpsc is required with respect to this matter 
pepco has appealed the hearing examiner s decision on the treatment of edit and aditc and corporate reorganization costs to the mpsc 
pepco cannot predict what the outcome of the appeal will be or when the appeal might be decided 
pepco believes that its calculation of the maryland customers share of divestiture proceeds is correct 
however  depending on the ultimate outcome of this proceeding  pepco could be required to share with its customers approximately percent of the edit and aditc balances described above and make additional gain sharing payments related to the disallowed severance payments 
such additional payments would be charged to expense in the quarter and year in which a final decision is rendered and could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for those periods 
however  neither phi nor pepco believes that additional gain sharing payments  if any  or the aditc related payments to the irs  if required  would have a material adverse impact on its financial condition 
sos and default service proceedings district of columbia in february  the dcpsc opened a new proceeding to consider issues relating to a the establishment of terms and conditions for providing sos in the district of columbia after pepco s obligation to provide sos terminated on february   and b the selection of a new sos provider 
in december  the dcpsc issued an order that set forth the terms and conditions for the selection of a new sos provider s and the provision of sos by pepco on a contingency basis 
in december  the dcpsc also issued an order adopting terms and conditions that would apply if pepco continued as the sos provider after february  in march  the dcpsc issued an order adopting the wholesale sos model  ie  pepco would continue to be the sos provider in the district of columbia after february  this march order  as amended by a dcpsc order issued in july  extends pepco s obligation to provide default electricity supply at market rates for up to an additional months for small commercial and residential customers  and for an additional months for large commercial customers 
in august  the dcpsc issued an order adopting administrative charges for residential  small and large commercial dc sos customers that are intended to allow pepco to recover the administrative costs incurred to provide the sos supply 
the approved administrative charges include an average margin for pepco of approximately per kilowatt hour  calculated based on total sales to residential  small and large commercial dc sos customers over the twelve months ended december  because margins vary by customer class  the actual average margin over any given time period will depend on the number of dc sos customers from each customer class and the load taken by such customers over the time period 
the administrative charges went into effect for pepco s dc sos sales on february  pepco completed the first competitive procurement process for dc sos at the end of october and filed the proposed new sos rates with the dc psc on november  the tpa with mirant under which pepco obtained the fixed rate dc sos supply ended on january   while the new sos supply contracts with the winning bidders in the competitive procurement process began on february  pepco procured power separately on the market for next day deliveries to cover the period from january through january   before the new dc sos contracts began 
consequently  pepco had to pay the difference between the procurement cost of power on the market for next day deliveries and the current dc sos rates charged to customers during the period from january through january  in addition  because the new dc sos rates did not go into effect until february   pepco had to pay the difference between the procurement cost of power under the new dc sos contracts and the dc sos rates charged to customers for the period from february to february  the total amount of the diff erence is estimated to be approximately million 
this difference  however  will be included in the calculation of the generation procurement credit gpc for dc for the period february  through february  the gpc provides for a sharing between pepco s customers and shareholders  on an annual basis  of any margins  but not losses  that pepco earned providing sos in the district of columbia during the four year period from february  through february  currently  based on the rates paid by pepco to mirant under the tpa settlement  there is no customer sharing 
however  in the event that pepco were to ultimately realize a significant recovery from the mirant bankruptcy estate associated with the tpa settlement  the gpc would be recalculated  and the amount of customer sharing with respect to such recovery would be reduced because of the million loss being included in the gpc calculation 
maryland under a settlement approved by the mpsc in april addressing sos service in maryland following the expiration of pepco s fixed rate default supply obligations in july  pepco is required to provide default electricity supply at market rates to residential and small commercial customers through may  to medium sized commercial customers through may  and to large commercial customers through may in accordance with the settlement  pepco purchases the power supply required to satisfy its market rate default supply obligations from wholesale suppliers under contracts entered into pursuant to a competitive bid procedure approved by the mpsc 
pepco is entitled to recover from its default supply customers the cost of the default supply plus an average margin of per kilowatt hour  calculated based on total sales to residential  small and large commercial maryland sos customers over the twelve months ended december  because margins vary by customer class  the actual average margin over any given time period will depend on the number of maryland sos customers from each customer class and the load taken by such customers over the time period 
under a settlement approved by the mpsc in april addressing sos service in maryland following the expiration of dpl s fixed rate default supply obligations to non residential customers in june and to residential customers through june  dpl is required to provide default electricity supply at market rates to residential and small commercial customers through may  to medium sized commercial customers through may  and to large commercial customers through may in accordance with the settlement  dpl purchases the power supply required to satisfy its market rate default supply obligations from wholesale suppliers under contracts entered into pursuant to a competitive bid procedure approved and supervised by the mpsc 
dpl is entitled to recover from its default supply customers the costs of the default supply plus an average margin of per kilowatt hour  calculated based on total sales to residential  small  and large commercial maryland sos customers over the twelve months ended december  because margins vary by customer class  the actual average margin over any given time period will depend on the number of maryland sos customers from each customer class and the load taken by such customers over the time period 
virginia under amendments to the virginia electric utility restructuring act implemented in march  dpl is obligated to offer default service to customers in virginia for an indefinite period until relieved of that obligation by the vscc 
dpl currently obtains all of the energy and capacity needed to fulfill its default service obligations in virginia under a supply agreement with conectiv energy 
a prior agreement  also with conectiv energy  terminated effective december  the current contract was entered into after conducting a competitive bid procedure identical to the maryland sos process in most respects and conectiv energy was the lowest bidder to provide wholesale power supply for dpl s virginia default service customers 
the new supply agreement commenced january  and expires in may on october   dpl filed an application with the vscc for approval to increase the rates that dpl charges its virginia default service customers to allow it to recover its costs for power under the new supply agreement plus an administrative charge and a margin 
a vscc order dated november  allowed dpl to put interim rates into effect on january   subject to refund if the vscc subsequently determined the rate is excessive 
the interim rates reflected an increase of cents per kwh to the fuel rate  which provide for recovery of the entire amount being paid by dpl to conectiv energy  but did not include an administrative charge or margin  pending further consideration of this issue 
therefore  the november order also directed the parties to file memoranda concerning whether administrative costs and a margin are properly recovered through a fuel clause mechanism 
memoranda were filed by dpl  the vscc staff and virginia s office of attorney general 
the vscc ruled on january   that the administrative charge and margin are base rate items not recoverable through a fuel clause 
no appeal is planned regarding this filing 
a settlement resolving all other issues and m aking the interim rates final was filed on march   contingent only on possible future adjustment depending on the result of a related proceeding at ferc 
a hearing is scheduled for march   and the vscc is expected to approve the settlement 
also in october  dpl and conectiv energy jointly filed an application with the vscc under virginia s affiliates act requesting authorization for dpl to enter into a contract to purchase power from an affiliate 
this authorization permits the contract to be executed with an affiliate  but is not a ruling on the merits of the contract 
a vscc order dated december  granted approval for dpl to purchase power from conectiv energy under the new contract according to its terms beginning january  on october   conectiv energy made a filing with ferc requesting authorization to enter into a contract to supply power to an affiliate 
on december   ferc granted the requested authorization effective january   subject to refund and hearings on the narrow question whether  in the absence of direct vscc oversight over the dpl competitive bid process  dpl unduly preferred its own affiliate  conectiv energy  in the design and implementation of the dpl competitive bid process  or unduly favored conectiv energy in the credit criteria and analysis applied 
dpl cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding 
delaware under a settlement approved by the dpsc  dpl is required to provide default electricity supply to customers in delaware until may  on october   the dpsc initiated a proceeding to investigate and determine which entity should act as the standard offer supplier in dpl s delaware service territory after may   and what prices should be charged for sos after may  similar to the process used in maryland  the process used in delaware consists of three separate stages 
the stage process was constructed to allow the dpsc to determine by february  the fundamental issues related to the selection of an sos supplier 
stage will resolve issues relating to the process under which supply will be acquired by the sos provider and way in which sos prices will be set and monitored 
in the last stage  these selection and pricing mechanisms would be implemented to determine the post may sos supplier and the post may sos price 
on january   the dpsc staff issued a report recommending to the dpsc that dpl be selected as the sos supplier  subject to further discussions as to how to establish sos prices 
on february   the dpsc voted to approve an sos process that will allow a wholesale standard offer service model with dpl as the sos provider 
issues including the length of this extension and any profit margin that dpl may be able to earn and retain in conjunction with this service have been deferred for further discussion and will be decided by the dpsc at a later date 
a written dpsc order documenting this decision is expected sometime in march or april proposed shut down of bl england generating facility  construction of transmission facilities pursuant to a september  njbpu order  ace filed a report on april  with the njbpu recommending that the bl england generating facility be shut down in accordance with the terms of an april  preliminary settlement agreement among phi  conectiv and ace  njdep and the attorney general of new jersey 
the report stated that the operation of the bl england facility is necessary at the present time to satisfy reliability standards  but that those reliability standards could also be satisfied in other ways 
the report concludes that  based on bl england s current and projected operating costs resulting from compliance with more restrictive environmental requirements  the most cost effective way in which to meet reliability standards is to shut down the bl england facility and construct additional transmission lines into southern new jersey 
ace cannot predict whether the njbpu will approve the construction of the additional transmission lines 
in letters dated may and september to pjm  ace informed pjm of its intent  as owner of the bl england generating plant  to retire the entire plant mw on december  pjm completed its independent analysis to determine the upgrades required to eliminate any identified reliability problems resulting from the retirement of bl england and recommended that certain transmission upgrades be installed prior to the summer of ace s independent assessment confirmed that the transmission upgrades identified by pjm are the transmission upgrades necessary to maintain reliability in the atlantic zone after the retirement of bl england 
the amount of the costs incurred by ace to construct the recommended transmission upgrades that ace would be permitted to recover from load serving entities that use ace s transmission system would be subject to approval by ferc 
the amount of construction costs that ace would be permitted to re cover from retail ratepayers would be determined in accordance with the treatment of transmission related revenue requirements in retail rates under the jurisdiction of the appropriate state regulatory commission 
ace cannot predict how the recovery of such costs will ultimately be treated by ferc and the state regulatory commissions and  therefore  cannot predict the financial impact to ace of installing the recommended transmission upgrades 
however  in the event that the njbpu makes satisfactory findings and grants other requested approvals concerning the retirement of bl england and approves the construction of the transmission upgrades required to maintain reliability in the atlantic zone after such retirement  ace expects to begin construction of the appropriate transmission upgrades while final decisions by ferc and state regulatory commissions concerning the methodology for recovery of the costs of such construction are still pending 
on november   ace made a filing with the njbpu requesting approval of the transmission upgrades required to maintain reliability in the atlantic zone after the retirement of bl england 
on december   ace filed a petition with the njbpu requesting that the njbpu establish a proceeding that will consist of a phase i and phase ii and that the procedural process for the phase i proceeding require intervention and participation by all persons interested in the prudence of the decision to shut down bl england generating facility and the categories of stranded costs associated with shutting down and dismantling the facility and remediation of the site 
ace contemplates that phase ii of this proceeding  which would be initiated by an ace filing in or  would establish the actual level of prudently incurred stranded costs to be recovered from customers in rates 
ace cannot predict the outcome of these two proceedings 
on november   ace made a filing with the njbpu requesting approval of year capital projects with respect to bl england 
this filing was made pursuant the september  bl england rate order  which established a requirement that ace file for approval of capital expenditures in excess of million 
for  four projects  totaling million in capital expenditures  have been identified as necessary to allow continued operation of bl england until its retirement 
two of these projects are well below the million threshold set forth in the september  njbpu order and two are above that threshold 
ace cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding 
general litigation asbestos during  pepco was served with amended complaints filed in the state circuit courts of prince george s county  baltimore city and baltimore county  maryland in separate ongoing  consolidated proceedings known as in re personal injury asbestos case 
pepco and other corporate entities were brought into these cases on a theory of premises liability 
under this theory  plaintiffs argue that pepco was negligent in not providing a safe work environment for employees or its contractors  who allegedly were exposed to asbestos while working on pepco s property 
initially  a total of approximately individual plaintiffs added pepco to their complaints 
while the pleadings are not entirely clear  it appears that each plaintiff sought million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages from each defendant 
since the initial filings in  additional individual suits have been filed against pepco  and significant numbers of cases have been dismissed 
as a result of two motions to dismiss  numerous hearings and meetings and one motion for summary judgment  pepco has had approximately of these cases successfully dismissed with prejudice  either voluntarily by the plaintiff or by the court 
of the approximately remaining asbestos cases pending against pepco  approximately cases were filed after december   and have been tendered to mirant for defense and indemnification pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase and sale agreement 
while the aggregate amount of monetary damages sought in the remaining suits excluding those tendered to mirant exceeds million  pepco believes the amounts claimed by current plaintiffs are greatly exaggerated 
the amount of total liability  if any  and any related insurance recovery cannot be determined at this time  however  based on information and relevant circumstances known at this time  pepco does not believe these suits will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition 
however  if an unfavorable decision were rendered against pepco  it could have a material adverse effect on pepco s and phi s results of operations 
enron on december   enron north america corp 
and several of its affiliates collectively  enron filed for protection under the united states bankruptcy code 
in december  dpl and conectiv energy terminated all energy trading transactions under various agreements with enron 
in late january  after several months of discussions between the parties concerning the amount owed by dpl and conectiv energy  enron filed an adversary complaint against conectiv energy in the bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york 
the complaint sought  among other things  damages in the amount of approximately million 
on june   the bankruptcy court approved a settlement among enron  conectiv energy and dpl pursuant to which conectiv energy paid enron an agreed settlement amount that was less than the million damages enron sought and the parties released all claims against each other 
conectiv energy had previously established a reserve in an amount equal to the agreed settlement payment 
accordingly  the settlement did not have an effect on earnings 
environmental litigation phi  through its subsidiaries  is subject to regulation by various federal  regional  state  and local authorities with respect to the environmental effects of its operations  including air and water quality control  solid and hazardous waste disposal  and limitations on land use 
in addition  federal and state statutes authorize governmental agencies to compel responsible parties to clean up certain abandoned or unremediated hazardous waste sites 
phi s subsidiaries may incur costs to clean up currently or formerly owned facilities or sites found to be contaminated  as well as other facilities or sites that may have been contaminated due to past disposal practices 
in may  the us department of justice doj invited dpl to enter into pre filing negotiations in connection with dpl s alleged liability under cercla at the diamond state salvage site in wilmington  delaware 
in the context of the negotiations  doj informed dpl that dpl is a de minimis party at the site 
in february  dpl entered into a de minimis consent decree with the united states which  if approved by the us district court  would require dpl to pay  as reimbursement of the government s response costs  resolve dpl s alleged liability  and provide dpl a covenant not to sue from the united states and protection from third party claims for contribution 
in july  dpl entered into an administrative consent order with the maryland department of the environment mde to perform a remedial investigation feasibility study ri fs to further identify the extent of soil  sediment and ground and surface water contamination related to former manufactured gas plant mgp operations at the cambridge  maryland site on dpl owned property and to investigate the extent of mgp contamination on adjacent property 
the costs for completing the ri fs for this site are approximately  approximately  of which will be expended in the costs of cleanup resulting from the ri fs will not be determinable until the ri fs is completed and an agreement with respect to cleanup is reached with the mde 
dpl expects to complete the ri fs in the first quarter of in october  each of pepco and dpl received notice from epa that it  along with several hundred other companies  might be a prp in connection with the spectron superfund site in elkton  maryland 
the site was operated as a hazardous waste disposal  recycling and processing facility from to in august  pepco entered into a consent decree for de minimis parties with epa to resolve its liability at this site 
under the terms of the consent decree  which was approved by the us district court for the district of maryland on march   pepco made de minimis payments to the united states and a group of prps 
in return  those parties agreed not to sue pepco for past and future costs of remediation at the site and the united states will also provide protection against third party claims for contributions related to response actions at the site 
the consent decree does not cover any damages to natural resources 
however  pepco believes that any liability that it might incur due to natural resource damage at this site would not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
in february  the epa informed dpl that it will have no future liability for contribution to the remediation of the site 
in the early s  both pepco and dpl sold scrap transformers  some of which may have contained some level of pcbs  to a metal reclaimer operating at the metal bank cottman avenue site in philadelphia  pennsylvania  owned by a nonaffiliated company 
in december  pepco and dpl were notified by epa that they  along with a number of other utilities and non utilities  were prps in connection with the pcb contamination at the site 
in october  an ri fs including a number of possible remedies was submitted to the epa 
in december  the epa issued a record of decision that set forth a selected remedial action plan with estimated implementation costs of approximately million 
in june  the epa issued a unilateral administrative order to pepco and other prps to conduct the design and actions called for in its decision 
on may   two of the potentially liable owner operator entities filed for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
on october   the bankruptcy court confirmed a reorganization plan that incorporates the terms of a settlement among the debtors  the united states and a group of utility prps including pepco 
under the settlement  the reorganized entity site owner will pay a total of million to remediate the site 
as of december   pepco had accrued million to meet its liability for a site remedy 
at the present time  it is not possible to estimate the total extent of epa s administrative and oversight costs or the expense associated with a site remedy ultimately implemented 
however  pepco believes that its liability at this site will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
in  dpl entered into a de minimis settlement with epa and paid approximately  to resolve its liability for cleanup costs at the site 
the de minimis settlement did not resolve dpl s responsibility for natural resource damages  if any  at the site 
dpl believes that any liability for natural resource damages at this site will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
in june  epa identified ace as a prp at the bridgeport rental and oil services superfund site in logan township  new jersey 
in september  ace along with other prps signed a consent decree with epa and njdep to address remediation of the site 
ace s liability is limited to percent of the aggregate remediation liability and thus far ace has made contributions of approximately  based on information currently available  ace may be required to contribute approximately an additional  ace believes that its liability at this site will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
in november  njdep identified ace as a prp at the delilah road landfill site in egg harbor township  new jersey 
in  ace  along with other prps  signed an administrative consent order with njdep to remediate the site 
the soil cap remedy for the site has been completed and the njdep conditionally approved the report submitted by the parties on the implementation of the remedy in january in march  njdep approved a ground water sampling and analysis plan 
the results of groundwater monitoring over the first year of this ground water sampling plan will help to determine the extent of post remedy operation and maintenance costs 
in march  epa demanded from the prp group reimbursement for epa s past costs at the site  totaling  the prp group objected to the demand for certain costs  but agreed to reimburse epa approximately  based on information currently available  ace may be required to contribute approximately an additional  ace believes that its liability for post remedy operation and maintenance costs will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
on april   approximately  gallons of oil leaked from a pipeline at a generation station that was owned by pepco at chalk point generating station in aquasco  maryland 
the pipeline was operated by support terminals services operating partnership lp st services  an unaffiliated pipeline management company 
the oil spread from swanson creek to the patuxent river and several of its tributaries 
the area affected covers portions of miles of shoreline along the patuxent river and approximately acres of marshland adjacent to the chalk point property 
in december  the department of transportation  office of pipeline safety  research and special programs administration ops issued a notice of probable violation  proposed civil penalty and proposed compliance order nopv 
the nopv alleged various deficiencies in compliance with regulations related to spill reporting  operations and maintenance of the pipeline and record keeping  none of which relate to the cause of the spill 
the nopv was issued to both pepco and st services and proposed a civil penalty in the amount of  on june   the ops issued a final order regarding the nopv in this matter 
the final order assessed a total fine of  with  of that amount assessed jointly against pepco and st services and the remaining  assessed solely against st services 
st services subsequently filed a petition for reconsideration 
all penalties were stayed pending the outcome of the petition for rec onsideration 
on february   ops issued a decision on the petition for reconsideration that affirmed the final order 
pepco s share of the  penalty assessed pursuant to the final order amounts to  preliminary settlement agreement with the njdep in an effort to address njdep s concerns regarding ace s compliance with new source review nsr requirements at bl england  on april   phi  conectiv and ace entered into a preliminary settlement agreement with njdep and the attorney general of new jersey 
the preliminary settlement agreement outlines the basic parameters for a definitive agreement to resolve ace s nsr liability at bl england and various other environmental issues at ace and conectiv energy facilities in new jersey 
among other things  the preliminary settlement agreement provides that contingent upon the receipt of necessary approvals from the njbpu  pjm  nerc  ferc  and other regulatory authorities and the receipt of permits to construct certain transmission facilities in southern new jersey ace will permanently cease operation of the bl england generating facility by december  in the event that ace is unable to shut down the bl england facility by december  through no fault of its own eg  because of failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals  bl england unit would be required to comply with stringent so  nox and particulate matter emissions limits set forth in the preliminary settlement agreement by october   and bl england unit would be required to comply with these emissions limits by may  if ace does not either shut down the bl england facility by december  or satisfy the emissions limits applicable in the event shut down is not so completed  ace would be re quired to pay significant monetary penalties 
to address ace s appeal of njdep actions relating to njdep s july denial of ace s request to renew a permit variance from sulfur in fuel requirements under new jersey regulations  effective through july   that authorized unit at bl england generating station to burn bituminous coal containing greater than sulfur  ace will be permitted to combust coal with a sulfur content of greater than at the bl england facility in accordance with the terms of bl england s current permit until december  and njdep will not impose new  more stringent short term so emissions limits on the bl england facility during this period 
to resolve any possible civil liability and without admitting liability for violations of the permit provisions of the new jersey apca and the psd provisions of the caa relating to modifications that may have been undertaken at the bl england facility  ace paid a  civil penalty to njdep on june   to compensate new jersey for other alleged violations of the apca and or the caa  ace will undertake environmental projects valued at million  which are beneficial to the state of new jersey and approved by the njdep in a consent order or other final settlement document 
ace will submit all federally required studies and complete construction of facilities necessary to satisfy the epa s new cooling water intake structure regulations in accordance with a schedule that njdep will establish in the renewal njpdes permit for the bl england facility 
the schedule will take into account ace s agreement  provided that all regulatory approvals are obtained  to shut down the bl england facility by december  to resolve any possible civil liability and without admitting liability for natural resource damages resulting from groundwater contamination at the bl england facility  conectiv energy s deepwater generating facility and ace s operations center near pleasantville  new jersey  ace and conectiv will pay njdep  or property of equivalent value and will remediate the groundwater contamination at all three sites 
if subsequent data indicate that groundwater contamination is more extensive than indicated in njdep s preliminary analysis  njdep may seek additional compensation for natural resource damages 
the preliminary settlement agreement also provides that the parties will work toward a consent order or other final settlement document that reflects the terms of the preliminary settlement agreement 
ace  conectiv and phi continue to negotiate with the njdep the terms of a consent order or other final settlement document 
critical accounting policies general the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates represent those estimates and assumptions that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and that have a material impact on financial condition or operating performance 
accounting policy choices pepco holdings management believes that based on the nature of the businesses in which its subsidiaries are primarily engaged  pepco holdings has very little choice regarding many of the accounting policies it utilizes 
in that regard  the most significant portion of pepco holdings business consists of its regulated utility operations  which are subject to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
sfas no 
does allow regulated entities  in appropriate circumstances  to establish regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities and to defer the income statement impact of certain costs that are expected to be recovered in future rates 
however  management believes that in the areas that pepco holdings is afforded accounting policy choices  its selection from among the alternatives available generally would not have a material impact on the compan y s financial condition or results of operations 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  such as statement of position disclosure of certain significant risks and uncertainties  requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
examples of significant estimates used by pepco holdings include the assessment of contingencies and the need amount for reserves of future receipts from mirant refer to the relationship with mirant section  herein  the calculation of future cash flows and fair value amounts for use in goodwill and asset impairment evaluations  fair value calculations based on estimating market pricing associated with derivative instruments  pension and other post retirement benefits assumptions  unbilled revenue calculations  and judgment involved with assessing the probability of recovery of regulatory assets 
additionally  phi is subject to legal  regulatory  and other proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business 
we record an estimated liability for these proceedings and claims based upon the probable and reasonably estimatable criteria contained in sfas no 
accounting for contingencies 
although pepco holdings believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
goodwill impairment evaluation pepco holdings believes that the estimates involved in its goodwill impairment evaluation process represent critical accounting estimates because they i may be susceptible to change from period to period because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about the discounting of future cash flows  which are inherently uncertain  ii actual results could vary from those used in pepco holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material  and iii the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on pepco holdings assets and the net loss related to an impairment charge could be material 
the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  require the evaluation of goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
sfas no 
indicates that if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  including goodwill  an impairment charge may be necessary 
pepco holdings goodwill that was generated in the transaction by which pepco acquired conectiv in was allocated to pepco holdings power delivery segment 
in order to estimate the fair value of its power delivery segment  pepco holdings discounts the estimated future cash flows associated with the segment using a discounted cash flow model with a single interest rate that is commensurate with the risk involved with such an investment 
the estimation of fair value is dependent on a number of factors  including but not limited to interest rates  future growth assumptions  operating and capital expenditure requirements and other factors  changes in which could materially impact the results of impairment testing 
pepco holdings tested its goodwill for impairment as of july  this testing concluded that pepco holdings goodwill balance was not impaired 
a hypothetical decrease in phi power delivery segment s forecasted cash flows of percent would not have resulted in an impairment charge 
long lived assets impairment evaluation pepco holdings believes that the estimates involved in its long lived asset impairment evaluation process represent critical accounting estimates because they i are highly susceptible to change from period to period because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about undiscounted and discounted future cash flows and fair values  which are inherently uncertain  ii actual results could vary from those used in pepco holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material  and iii the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on pepco holdings assets as well as the net loss related to an impairment charge could be material 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets requires that certain long lived assets must be tested for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss shall only be recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
the asset is deemed to not be recoverable when its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
in order to estimate an asset s future cash flows  pepco holdings considers historical cash flows 
pepco holdings uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors  including forward price curves for energy  fuel costs  legislative initiatives  and operating costs 
the process of determining fair value is done consistent with the process described in assessing the fair value of goodwill  discussed above 
derivative instruments pepco holdings believes that the estimates involved in accounting for its derivative instruments represent critical accounting estimates because i the fair value of the instruments are highly susceptible to changes in market value and interest rate fluctuations  ii there are significant uncertainties in modeling techniques used to measure fair value in certain circumstances  iii actual results could vary from those used in pepco holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material  and iv changes in fair values and market prices could result in material impacts to pepco holdings assets  liabilities  other comprehensive income loss  and results of operations 
refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies accounting for derivatives  herein  for information on phi s accounting for derivatives 
pepco holdings and its subsidiaries use derivative instruments primarily to manage risk associated with commodity prices and interest rates 
sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  governs the accounting treatment for derivatives and requires that derivative instruments be measured at fair value 
the fair value of derivatives is determined using quoted exchange prices where available 
for instruments that are not traded on an exchange  external broker quotes are used to determine fair value 
for some custom and complex instruments  an internal model is used to interpolate broker quality price information 
models are also used to estimate volumes for certain transactions 
the same valuation methods are used to determine the value of non derivative  commodity exposure for risk management purposes 
pension and other post retirement benefit plans pepco holdings believes that the estimates involved in reporting the costs of providing pension and other post retirement benefits represent critical accounting estimates because i they are based on an actuarial calculation that includes a number of assumptions which are subjective in nature  ii they are dependent on numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience  and iii changes in assumptions could impact pepco holdings expected future cash funding requirements for the plans and would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations  the reported pension and other post retirement benefit liability on the balance sheet  and the reported annual net periodic pension and other post retirement benefit cost on the income statement 
in terms of quantifying the anticipated impact of a change in assumptions  pepco holdings estimates that a 
change in the discount rate used to value the benef it obligations could result in a million impact on its consolidated balance sheets and income statements 
additionally  pepco holdings estimates that a 
change in the expected return on plan assets could result in a million impact on the consolidated balance sheets and income statements and a 
change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate could result in a 
million impact on its consolidated balance sheets and income statements 
pepco holdings management consults with its actuaries and investment consultants when selecting its plan assumptions 
pepco holdings follows the guidance of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions  when accounting for these benefits 
under these accounting standards  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
in accordance with these standards  the impact of changes in these assumptions and the difference between actual and expected or estimated results on pension and post retirement obligations is generally recognized over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans rather than immediately recognized in the income statement 
plan assets are stated at their market value as of the measurement date  december regulation of power delivery operations the requirements of sfas no 
apply to the power delivery businesses of pepco  dpl  and ace 
pepco holdings believes that the judgment involved in accounting for its regulated activities represent critical accounting estimates because i a significant amount of judgment is required including but not limited to the interpretation of laws and regulatory commission orders to assess the probability of the recovery of regulatory assets  ii actual results and interpretations could vary from those used in pepco holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material  and iii the impact that writing off a regulatory asset would have on pepco holdings assets and the net loss related to the charge could be material 
new accounting policies issued sfas r in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment which establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments primarily for employee services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
in most cases  fas r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and to recognize that cost over the service period  normally the vesting period 
fas r will be effective for pepco holdings as of the july  pepco holdings is in the process of evaluating the impact of fas r and does not anticipate that its implementation will hav e a material effect on its overall financial position or net results of operations 
risk factors the business of phi and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including the events or conditions identified below 
the occurrence of one or more of these events or conditions could have an adverse effect on the business of phi and its subsidiaries  including  depending on the circumstances  their results of operations and financial condition 
phi and its subsidiaries are subject to substantial governmental regulation 
if phi or any of its subsidiaries receives unfavorable regulatory treatment  phi s business could be negatively affected 
phi is a registered public utility holding company that is subject to regulation by the sec under puhca 
as a registered public utility holding company  phi requires sec approval to  among other things  issue securities  acquire or dispose of utility assets or securities of utility companies and acquire other businesses 
in addition  under puhca transactions among phi and its subsidiaries generally must be performed at cost and subsidiaries are prohibited from paying dividends out of capital or unearned surplus without sec approval 
the utility businesses conducted by phi s power delivery subsidiaries are subject to regulation by various federal  state and local regulatory agencies that significantly affects their operations 
each of pepco  dpl and ace is regulated by public service commissions in its service territories  with respect to  among other things  the rates it can charge retail customers for the delivery of electricity 
in addition  the rates that the companies can charge for electricity transmission are regulated by ferc 
the companies cannot change delivery or transmission rates without approval by the applicable regulatory authority 
while the approved delivery and transmission rates are intended to permit the companies to recover their costs of service and earn a reasonable rate of return  the profitability of the companies is affected by the rates they are able to charge 
in addition  if the costs incurred by any of the companies in operating it s transmission and distribution facilities exceed the allowed amounts for costs included in the approved rates  the financial results of that company  and correspondingly  phi  will be adversely affected 
phi s subsidiaries also are required to have numerous permits  approvals and certificates from governmental agencies that regulate their businesses 
phi believes that its subsidiaries have obtained or sought renewal of the material permits  approvals and certificates necessary for their existing operations and that their businesses are conducted in accordance with applicable laws  however  phi is unable to predict the impact of future regulatory activities of any of these agencies on its business 
changes in or reinterpretations of existing laws or regulations  or the imposition of new laws or regulations  may require phi s subsidiaries to incur additional expenses or to change the way they conduct their operations 
phi s business could be adversely affected by the mirant bankruptcy 
in  pepco sold substantially all of its electricity generation assets to mirant 
as part of the sale  pepco entered into several ongoing contractual arrangements with mirant and certain of its subsidiaries 
on july   mirant and most of its subsidiaries filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court for the northern district of texas 
depending on the outcome of the proceedings  the mirant bankruptcy could adversely affect phi s business 
see relationship with mirant corporation  herein 
pepco may be required to make additional divestiture proceeds gain sharing payments to customers in the district of columbia and maryland 
pepco currently is involved in regulatory proceedings in maryland and the district of columbia related to the sharing of the net proceeds from the sale of its generation related assets 
the principal issue in the proceedings is whether pepco should be required to share with customers the excess deferred income taxes and accumulated deferred investment tax credits associated with the sold assets and  if so  whether such sharing would violate the normalization provisions of the internal revenue code and its implementing regulations 
depending on the outcome of the proceedings  pepco could be required to make additional gain sharing payments to customers and payments to the irs in the amount of the associated accumulated deferred investment tax credits  and pepco might be unable to use accelerated depreciation on district of columbia and maryland allocated or assigned property 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regulatory and other matters 
the operating results of phi s power delivery and competitive energy subsidiaries fluctuate on a seasonal basis and can be adversely affected by changes in weather 
the businesses of phi s power delivery and competitive energy subsidiaries are seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on their operating performance 
demand for electricity is generally greater in the summer months associated with cooling and demand for electricity and gas is generally greater in the winter months associated with heating as compared to other times of the year 
accordingly  phi s power delivery and competitive energy subsidiaries historically have generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer 
the facilities of phi s subsidiaries may not operate as planned or may require significant maintenance expenditures  which could decrease their revenues or increase their expenses 
operation of generation  transmission and distribution facilities involves many risks  including the breakdown or failure of equipment  accidents  labor disputes and performance below expected levels 
older facilities and equipment  even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices  may require significant capital expenditures for additions or upgrades to keep them operating at peak efficiency  to comply with changing environmental requirements  or to provide reliable operations 
natural disasters and weather related incidents  including tornadoes  hurricanes and snow and ice storms  also can disrupt generation  transmission and distribution delivery systems 
operation of generation  transmission and distribution facilities below expected capacity levels can reduce revenues and result in the incurrence of additional expenses that may not be recoverable from customers or through insurance 
furthermore  if phi s operatin g subsidiaries are unable to perform their contractual obligations for any of these reasons  they may incur penalties or damages 
the transmission facilities of phi s power delivery subsidiaries are interconnected with the facilities of other transmission facility owners whose actions could have a negative impact on the operations of phi s subsidiaries 
the transmission facilities of pepco  dpl and ace are directly interconnected with the transmission facilities of contiguous utilities and as such are part of an interstate power transmission grid 
ferc has designated a number of regional transmission operators to coordinate the operation of portions of the interstate transmission grid 
each of pepco  dpl and ace is a member of pjm  which is the regional transmission operator that coordinates the movement of electricity in all or parts of delaware  maryland  new jersey  ohio  pennsylvania  virginia  west virginia and the district of columbia 
pepco  dpl and ace operate their transmission facilities under the direction and control of pjm 
pjm and the other regional transmission operators have established sophisticated systems that are designed to ensure the reliability of the operation of transmission facilities and prevent the operations of one utility from having an adverse impact o n the operations of the other utilities 
however  the systems put in place by pjm and the other regional transmission operators may not always be adequate to prevent problems at other utilities from causing service interruptions in the transmission facilities of pepco  dpl or ace 
if any of pepco  dpl or ace were to suffer such a service interruption  it could have a negative impact on its and phi s business 
the cost of compliance with environmental laws is significant and new environmental laws may increase the expenses of phi and its subsidiaries 
the operations of phi s subsidiaries  both regulated and unregulated  are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental statutes  rules and regulations  relating to air quality  water quality  spill prevention  waste management  natural resources  site remediation  and health and safety 
these laws and regulations require phi s subsidiaries to make capital expenditures and to incur other expenditures to  among other things  meet emissions standards  conduct site remediation and perform environmental monitoring 
phi s subsidiaries also may be required to pay significant remediation costs with respect to third party sites 
if phi s subsidiaries fail to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations  even if caused by factors beyond their control  such failure could result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities and the need to expend significant sums to come into compliance 
in addition  phi s subsidiaries incur costs to obtain and comply with a variety of environmental permits  licenses  inspections and other approvals 
if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if phi s subsidiaries fail to obtain  maintain or comply with any such approval  operations at affected facilities could be halted or subjected to additional costs 
new environmental laws and regulations  or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations  could impose more stringent limitations on the operations of phi s subsidiaries or require them to incur significant additional costs 
phi s current compliance strategy may not successfully address the relevant standards and interpretations of the future 
phi s competitive energy business is highly competitive the unregulated energy generation  supply and marketing businesses in the mid atlantic region are characterized by intense competition at both the wholesale and retail levels 
phi s competitive energy businesses compete with numerous non utility generators  independent power producers  wholesale power marketers and brokers  and traditional utilities that continue to operate generation assets 
this competition generally has the effect of reducing margins and requires a continual focus on controlling costs 
phi s competitive energy businesses rely on some transmission and distribution assets that they do not own or control to deliver wholesale electricity and to obtain fuel for their generation facilities 
phi s competitive energy businesses depend upon transmission facilities owned and operated by others for delivery to customers 
the operation of their generation facilities also depends upon coal  natural gas or diesel fuel supplied by others 
if electric transmission is disrupted or capacity is inadequate or unavailable  the competitive energy businesses ability to sell and deliver wholesale power  and therefore to fulfill their contractual obligations  could be adversely affected 
similarly  if the fuel supply to one or more of their generation plants is disrupted and storage or other alternative sources of supply are not available the competitive energy businesses ability to operate their generating facilities could be adversely affected 
changes in technology may adversely affect phi s power delivery and competitive energy businesses 
research and development activities are ongoing to improve alternative technologies to produce electricity  including fuel cells  microturbines and photovoltaic solar cells 
it is possible that advances in these or other alternative technologies will reduce the costs of electricity production from these technologies  thereby making the generating facilities of phi s competitive energy businesses less competitive 
in addition  increased conservation efforts and advances in technology could reduce demand for electricity supply and distribution  which could adversely affect phi s power delivery and competitive energy businesses 
changes in technology also could alter the channels through which retail electric customers buy electricity  which could adversely affect phi s power delivery businesses 
phi s risk management procedures may not prevent losses in the operation of its competitive energy businesses 
the operations of phi s competitive energy businesses are conducted in accordance with sophisticated risk management systems that are designed to quantify risk 
however  actual results sometimes deviate from modeled expectations 
in particular  risks in phi s energy activities are measured and monitored utilizing value at risk models to determine the effects of the potential one day favorable or unfavorable price movement 
these estimates are based on historical price volatility and assume a normal distribution of price changes 
consequently  if prices significantly deviate from historical prices  phi s risk management systems  including assumptions supporting risk limits  may not protect phi from significant losses 
in addition  adverse changes in energy prices may result in economic losses in phi s earnings and cash flows and reductions in the value of assets on its balance sheet under applicable accounting rules 
the commodity hedging procedures used by phi s competitive energy businesses may not protect them from significant losses caused by volatile commodity prices 
to lower the financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations  phi s competitive energy businesses routinely enter into contracts to hedge the value of their assets and operations 
as part of this strategy  phi s competitive energy businesses utilize fixed price  forward  physical purchase and sales contracts  tolling agreements  futures  financial swaps and option contracts traded in the over the counter markets or on exchanges 
conectiv energy s goal is to hedge of both the expected power output of its generation facilities and the costs of fuel used to operate those facilities 
however  the actual level of hedging coverage may vary from these goals 
the economic hedge goals are approved by phi s corporate risk management committee and may change from time to time based on market conditions 
due to the high heat rate of the pepco energy services power plant generation  pepco energy services infrequently locks in the f orward value of these plants with wholesale contracts 
to the extent that phi s competitive energy businesses have unhedged positions or their hedging procedures do not work as planned  fluctuating commodity prices could result in significant losses 
the expiration of certain hedging arrangements could result in exposure of conectiv energy to a higher level of commodity price risk 
in order to lower its financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations  conectiv energy entered into an agreement consisting of a series of energy contracts with an international investment banking firm 
this agreement is designed to hedge approximately of conectiv energy s generation output and approximately of its supply obligations  with the intention of providing conectiv energy with a more predictable earnings stream during the term of the agreement 
this month agreement consists of two major components i a fixed price energy supply hedge that will be used to reduce conectiv energy s financial exposure under its current polr and sos supply commitment to dpl which extends through may and ii a generation off take agreement under which conectiv energy will receive a fixed monthly payment from the counterparty  and the counterparty will receive the profit realized from the sale of approximately of the elect ricity generated by conectiv energy s plants excluding the edge moor facility 
this series of energy contracts will terminate in may as a result  conectiv energy will be exposed to a higher level of commodity price risk  unless it were to replace the expiring contracts with new or similar contracts to hedge plant output and any future supply obligations that conectiv energy might enter into 
conectiv energy cannot at this time predict whether or to what extent it will  or will be able to  enter into new hedging contracts that provide commodity price risk protection 
acts of terrorism could adversely affect phi s businesses 
the threat of or actual acts of terrorism may affect the operations of phi and its subsidiaries in unpredictable ways and may cause changes in the insurance markets  force phi and its subsidiaries to increase security measures and cause disruptions of fuel supplies and markets 
if any of phi s infrastructure facilities  such as its electric generation  fuel storage  transmission or distribution facilities  were to be a direct target  or an indirect casualty  of an act of terrorism  its operations could be adversely affected 
instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism also could affect the ability of phi and its subsidiaries to raise needed capital 
the insurance coverage of phi and its subsidiaries may not be sufficient to cover all casualty losses that they might incur 
phi and its subsidiaries currently have insurance coverage for their facilities and operations in amounts and with deductibles that they consider appropriate 
however  there is no assurance that such insurance coverage will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms 
in addition  some risks  such as weather related casualties  may not be insurable 
in the case of loss or damage to property  plant or equipment  there is no assurance that the insurance proceeds  if any  received will be sufficient to cover the entire cost of replacement or repair 
phi and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected by economic conditions 
periods of slowed economic activity generally result in decreased demand for power  particularly by industrial and large commercial customers 
as a consequence  recessions or other downturns in the economy may result in decreased revenues and cash flows for phi s power delivery and competitive energy businesses 
the irs challenge to cross border energy sale and lease back transactions entered into by a phi subsidiary could result in loss of prior and future tax benefits 
pci maintains a portfolio of cross border energy sale leaseback transactions  which as of december  had a book value of approximately billion 
all of pci s cross border energy leases are with tax indifferent parties and were entered into prior to on february   the treasury department and irs issued a notice informing taxpayers that the irs intends to challenge the tax benefits claimed by taxpayers with respect to certain of these transactions 
phi believes there is a substantial likelihood that the irs will challenge the tax benefits realized from the interest and depreciation deductions claimed by pci with respect to these transactions  or the timing of these benefits  for the years through the tax benefits claimed by pci for these years were approximately million 
if the irs prevails  phi would be subject to additional taxes  along with interest and possibly penalties on the additional taxes  which could have a material adverse effect on phi s results of operations and cash flow 
in addition  a disallowance  rather than a deferral  of tax benefits to be realized by phi from these leases will require phi to adjust the book value of its leases and record a charge to earnings equal to the repricing impact of the disallowed deductions 
such a change would likely have a material adverse effect on phi s results of operations for the period in which the charge is recorded 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regulatory and other matters 
phi and its subsidiaries are dependent on their ability to successfully access capital markets 
an inability to access capital may adversely affect their business 
phi and its subsidiaries rely on access to both short term money markets and longer term capital markets as a source of liquidity and to satisfy their capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from their operations 
capital market disruptions  or a downgrade in credit ratings of phi or its subsidiaries  would increase the cost of borrowing or could adversely affect their ability to access one or more financial markets 
disruptions to the capital markets could include  but are not limited to recession or an economic slowdown  the bankruptcy of one or more energy companies  significant increases in the prices for oil or other fuel  a terrorist attack or threatened attacks  or a significant transmission failure 
phi may be required to  or may elect to  make significant cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plan 
phi follows the guidance of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions in accounting for pension benefits under the retirement plan  a non contributory defined benefit plan 
in accordance with these accounting standards  phi makes assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
changes in assumptions such as the use of a different discount rate or expected return on plan assets  affects the calculation of projected benefit obligations  accumulated benefit obligation  reported pension liability on phi s balance sheet  and reported annual net periodic pension benefit cost on phi s income statement 
furthermore  as a result of actual pension plan experience being different from expected  the accumulated benefit obligation abo could be greater than the fair value of pension plan assets 
if this were to occur  phi could be required to recognize an additional minimum liability as prescribed by sfas no 
the liability would be recorded as a reduction to common equity through a charge to other comprehensive income oci  and would not affect net income for the year 
the charge to oci would be restored through common equity in future periods when the fair value of plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation 
phi s funding policy is to make cash contributions to the pension plan sufficient for plan assets to exceed the abo  and avoid the recognition of an additional minimum liability 
use of alternative assumptions could also impact the expected future cash funding requirements for the pension plan if phi s defined benefit plan did not meet the minimum funding requirements of erisa 
phi s cash flow  ability to pay dividends and ability to satisfy debt obligations depend on the performance of its operating subsidiaries 
phi s unsecured obligations are effectively subordinated to the liabilities and the outstanding preferred stock of its subsidiaries 
phi is a holding company that conducts its operations entirely through its subsidiaries  and all of phi s consolidated operating assets are held by its subsidiaries 
accordingly  phi s cash flow  its ability to satisfy its obligations to creditors and its ability to pay dividends on its common stock are dependent upon the earnings of the subsidiaries and the distribution of such earnings to phi in the form of dividends 
the subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts due on any debt or equity securities issued by phi or to make any funds available for such payment 
because the claims of the creditors and preferred stockholders of phi s subsidiaries are superior to phi s entitlement to dividends  the unsecured debt and obligations of phi are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of its subsidiaries and to the rights of the holders of preferred stock to receive dividend payments 
energy companies are subject to adverse publicity  which may render phi and its subsidiaries vulnerable to negative regulatory and litigation outcomes 
the energy sector has been among the sectors of the economy that have been the subject of highly publicized allegations of misconduct in recent years 
in addition  many utility companies have been publicly criticized for their performance during recent natural disasters and weather related incidents 
adverse publicity of this nature may render legislatures  regulatory authorities  and tribunals less likely to view energy companies such as phi and its subsidiaries in a favorable light and may cause them to be susceptible to adverse outcomes with respect to decisions by such bodies 
provisions of the delaware general corporation law and phi s organizational documents may discourage an acquisition of phi 
phi s organizational documents and the delaware general corporation law both contain provisions that could impede the removal of phi s directors and discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire phi 
for example  phi has a staggered board of directors that is divided into three classes of equal size  with one class elected each year for a term of three years 
in addition  as a delaware corporation  phi is subject to the business combination law set forth in section of the delaware general corporation law  which could have the effect of delaying  discouraging or preventing an acquisition of phi

the major reasons for this difference were state income taxes net of federal benefit and the flow through of certain book tax depreciation differences 
the results of operations discussion below is for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  lack of comparability of operating results with prior years pepco s results of operations for the year ended december  include only its operations 
however  pepco s results of operations for the year ended  as previously reported by pepco  include pepco s operations consolidated with its pre merger subsidiaries potomac capital investment corporation pci and pepco energy services operations through july accordingly  the results of operations for and are not comparable 
in connection with pepco s acquisition of conectiv in august  pci and pepco energy services were transferred to phi 
operating revenue pepco s consolidated operating revenue decreased by million to  million in from  million in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in operating revenue recognized of million at pepco energy services and a decrease of million at pci 
these decreases were due to the fact that pepco energy services and pci s operating results were not recorded by pepco in because subsequent to july their ownership was transferred to phi 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in pepco s operating revenue due to the following regulated t d electric revenue increased by million in this increase results from a million increase from a fuel tax pass through  partially offset by a 
million decrease in regulated t d electric revenue 
the 
million decrease resulted from a 
decrease in delivered kilowatt hour sales 
dsr increased by million in due to colder winter weather as heating degree days increased by offset by a decrease in cooling degree days 
pepco s retail access to a competitive market for generation services was made available to all maryland customers on july  and to dc customers on january  at december   of pepco s maryland customers and of its dc customers have chosen alternate suppliers

these customers accounted for  megawatts of load in maryland of pepco s total load of  and  megawatts of load in dc of pepco s total load of 
other electric revenue decreased million primarily due to lower capacity megawatts available to sell  lower capacity market rates and restructuring in the pjm market 
operating expenses fuel and purchased energy pepco s consolidated fuel and purchased energy decreased by million to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in fuel and purchases energy recognized of million at pepco energy services due to the fact that pepco energy services operating results were not recorded by pepco in because subsequent to july its ownership was transferred to phi 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase of million at pepco primarily due to the recording of a million reserve to reflect a potential exposure related to a pre petition receivable from mirant corp  for which pepco filed a creditor s claim in bankruptcy proceedings and from million higher sos costs 
other operation and maintenance pepco s consolidated other operation and maintenance decreased by million to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in other operation and maintenance expense recognized of million at pepco energy services and a decrease of million at pci 
these decreases were due to the fact that pepco energy services and pci s operating results were not recorded by pepco in because subsequent to july their ownership was transferred to phi 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in pepco s other operation and maintenance expense due to storm restoration expenses incurred 
depreciation and amortization pepco s consolidated depreciation and amortization increased by million to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to an increase at pepco of related to software amortization during the year  partially offset by a decrease of million at pepco energy services and million at pci due to the fact that pepco energy services and pci s operating results were not recorded by pepco in because subsequent to july their ownership was transferred to phi 
other taxes pepco s consolidated other taxes increased by million to million in  from million for the corresponding period in this increase was due to higher fuel taxes over the period 
other income expenses pepco s consolidated other expenses decreased by million to million in from million for the corresponding period in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in operating revenue recognized of at pci  partially offset by a million increase at pepco 
the decrease at pci was due to the fact that its operating results were not recorded by pepco in because subsequent to july its ownership was transferred to phi 
income tax expense pepco s effective tax rate in was as compared to the federal statutory rate of 
the major reasons for this difference are state income taxes net of federal benefit and the flow through of certain book tax depreciation differences 
in  the effective rate was as compared to the federal statutory rate of 
the major reasons for this difference are state income taxes net of federal benefit and the flow through of certain book tax depreciation differences  partially offset by the inclusion of the tax benefits of pepco s pre merger subsidiaries through july capital resources and liquidity general financing activities pepco issued million of secured senior notes with maturities of and years 
proceeds of million were used to redeem higher interest rate securities of million and to repay short term debt of million 
pepco borrowed million under a bank loan due in proceeds were used to redeem mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of million and to repay short term debt 
working capital at december   pepco s current assets on a consolidated basis totaled million and its current liabilities totaled million 
at december   phi s current assets totaled million and its current liabilities totaled million 
pepco s working capital deficit results in large part from the fact that  in the normal course of business  it acquires energy supplies for its customers before the supplies are delivered to  metered and then billed to customers 
short term financings are used to meet liquidity needs 
short term financings are also used  at times  to temporarily fund redemptions of long term debt  until long term replacement issues are completed

the million decrease in investing cash flows in compared to primarily results from the acquisition of leveraged leases in by pci 
financing activities cash flows from financing activities result from issuing  repurchasing  and redeeming debt and equity securities  and paying dividends  and are summarized below for   and cash provided used dollars in millions dividends on common and preferred stock preferred securities redemptions long term debt  net short term debt  net all other financing cash flows  net net cash used by financing activities in december  pepco issued million in long term debt via a term loan due december  proceeds were used to redeem all million of pepco s mandatorily redeemable series preferred stock and to repay short term debt 
also in  pepco issued million of secured senior notes 
in pepco redeemed its mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities totaling million 
dividends on common and preferred stock were million in  million in  and million in the dividend was due to the august  acquisition of conectiv by pepco 
capital requirements construction expenditures pepco s construction expenditures for the year ended december  totaled million 
for the five year period through  pepco s total construction expenditures are projected to be approximately million 
dividends under puhca  phi is prohibited  without sec approval  from paying dividends on its common stock from capital or unearned surplus 
phi generates no operating income of its own 
accordingly  its ability to pay dividends to its shareholders depends on dividends received from its subsidiaries 
pepco s articles of incorporation contain provisions restricting the amount of dividends that can be paid on common stock when preferred stock is outstanding if the applicable company s capitalization ratio is less than 
for this purpose  the capitalization ratio is equal to i common stock capital plus surplus  divided by ii total capital including long term debt plus surplus 
pension funding pepco holdings has a noncontributory retirement plan the retirement plan that covers substantially all employees of pepco  conectiv and certain employees of other pepco holdings subsidiaries 
following the consummation of the acquisition of conectiv by pepco on august   the pepco general retirement plan and the conectiv retirement plan were merged into the retirement plan on december  the provisions and benefits of the merged retirement plan applicable to pepco employees are identical to those in the original pepco plan and the provisions and benefits applicable to conectiv employees are identical to those in the original conectiv plan 
as of the valuation  the retirement plan satisfied the minimum funding requirements of the employment retirement income security act of erisa without requiring any additional funding 
however  phi s funding policy with regard to the retirement plan is to maintain a funding level in excess of of its accumulated benefit obligation 
in and  phi made discretionary tax deductible cash contributions to the retirement plan in accordance with its funding policy 
in  the accumulated benefit obligation abo for the retirement plan increased over  due to the accrual of an additional year of service for participants and a decrease in the discount rate used to value the accumulated benefit obligation 
the change in the discount rate reflected the continued decline in interest rates in the retirement plan assets achieved returns in in excess of the levels assumed in the valuation 
as a result of the combination of these factors  in december phi contributed million all of which was funded by pepco to the retirement plan 
the contribution was made to ensure that under reasonable assumptions  the funding level at year end would be in excess of of the accrued benefit obligation 
in  phi contributed a total of million of which million was funded by pepco and million was funded by ace to the retirement plan 
assuming no changes to the current pension p lan assumptions  phi projects no funding will be required under erisa in  however  phi may elect to make a discretionary tax deductible contribution  if required to maintain its assets in excess of its abo 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments summary information about pepco s consolidated contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december   is as follows contractual maturity obligation total less than year years years after years dollars in millions short term debt long term debt interest payments on debt capital leases purchase power contracts a total a excludes the ppa related obligations that are part of the back to back agreement that was entered into with mirant 
refer to the relationship with mirant section herein for additional information 
sources of capital pepco s sources to meet its long term funding needs  such as capital expenditures  and its short term funding needs  such as working capital and the temporary funding of long term funding needs  include internally generated funds  security issuances and bank financing under new or existing facilities 
pepco s ability to generate funds from its operations and to access capital and credit markets is subject to risks and uncertainties 
see risk factors for a discussion of important factors that may impact these sources of capital 
short term funding sources pepco has traditionally used a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs  such as commercial paper  short term notes and bank lines of credit 
proceeds from short term borrowings are used primarily to meet working capital needs  but may also be used to temporarily fund long term capital requirements 
pepco maintains an ongoing commercial paper program of up to million 
the commercial paper notes can be issued with maturities up to days from the date of issue 
in july  pepco holdings  pepco  dpl and ace entered into a five year credit agreement with an aggregate borrowing limit of million 
this agreement replaced a million day credit agreement that was entered into on july  the respective companies also are parties to a three year credit agreement that was entered into in july and terminates in july with an aggregate borrowing limit of million 
pepco holdings credit limit under these facilities is million  and the credit limit of each of pepco  dpl and ace under these facilities is the lower of million and the maximum amount of short term debt authorized by the appropriate state commission  except that the aggregate amount of credit utilized by pepco  dpl and ace at any given time under these facilities may not exceed million 
funds borrowed under these facilities are available for general corporate purposes 
either credit facility also can be used as credit support for the commercial paper programs of the respective companies 
the three year and five year credit agreements contain customary financial and other covenants that  if not satisfied  could result in the acceleration of repayment obligations under the agreements or restrict the ability of the companies to borrow under the agreements 
among these covenants is the requirement that each borrowing company maintain a ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization of or less  computed in accordance with the terms of the credit agreements 
as of december   the applicable ratios for pepco holdings  pepco  dpl and ace were   and  respectively 
the credit agreements also contain a number of customary events of default that could result in the acceleration of repayment obligations under the agreements  including i the failure of any borrowing company or any of its significant subsidiaries to pay when due  or the acceleration of  certain indebtedness under other borrowing arrangements  ii certain bankruptcy events  judgments or decrees against any borrowing company or its significant subsidiaries  and iii a change in control as defined in the credit agreements of pepco holdings or the failure of pepco holdings to own all of the voting stock of pepco  dpl and ace 
in december  phi entered into a million term loan due december  with a bank 
the loan is variable rate  based on libor 
phi has the option to select interest periods based on one  two  three or six month libor rates 
the covenants in the agreement are substantially consistent with those found in the three year and five year credit agreements 
proceeds from the loan were used to pay down commercial paper 
long term funding sources the sources of long term funding for pepco are the issuance of debt and equity securities and borrowing under long term credit agreements 
proceeds from long term financings are used primarily to fund long term capital requirements  such as capital expenditures and new investments  and to refund or refinance existing securities 
puhca restrictions an sec financing order dated july  the financing order  requires that  in order to issue debt or equity securities  including commercial paper  pepco must maintain a ratio of common stock equity to total capitalization consisting of common stock  preferred stock  if any  long term debt and short term debt of at least percent 
at december  and  pepco s common equity ratio was percent and percent  respectively 
the financing order also requires that all rated securities issued by pepco be rated investment grade by at least one nationally recognized rating agency 
accordingly  if pepco s common equity ratio were less than percent or if no nationally recognized rating agency rated a security investment grade  pepco could not issue the security without first obtaining from the sec an amendment to the financing order 
if an amendment to the financing order is required to enable pepco to effect a financing  there is no certainty that such an amendment could be obtained  as to the terms and conditions on which an amendment could be obtained or as to the timing of sec action 
the failure to obtain timely relief from the sec  in such circumstances  could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of pepco 
other liquidity considerations for a discussion of the potential impact of the mirant bankruptcy on liquidity  see relationship with mirant corporation section that follows 
regulatory and other matters relationship with mirant corporation in  pepco sold substantially all of its electricity generation assets to mirant corporation  formerly southern energy  inc  pursuant to an asset purchase and sale agreement 
as part of the asset purchase and sale agreement  pepco entered into several ongoing contractual arrangements with mirant and certain of its subsidiaries collectively  mirant 
on july   mirant corporation and most of its subsidiaries filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court for the northern district of texas the bankruptcy court 
depending on the outcome of the matters discussed below  the mirant bankruptcy could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of pepco holdings and pepco 
however  management currently believes that pepco holdings and pepco currently have sufficient cash  cash flow and borrowing capacity under their credit facilities and in the capital markets to be able to satisfy any additional cash requirements that have arisen or may arise due to the mirant bankruptcy 
accordingly  management does not anticipate that the mirant bankruptcy will impair the ability of pepco holdings or pepco to fulfill their contractual obligations or to fund projected capital expenditures 
on this basis  management currently does not believe that the mirant bankruptcy will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of either company 
transition power agreements as part of the asset purchase and sale agreement  pepco and mirant entered into transition power agreements for maryland and the district of columbia  respectively collectively  the tpas 
under these agreements  mirant was obligated to supply pepco with all of the capacity and energy needed to fulfill its standard offer service obligations in maryland through june and its standard offer service obligations in the district of columbia through january  to avoid the potential rejection of the tpas  pepco and mirant entered into an amended settlement agreement and release dated as of october  the settlement agreement pursuant to which mirant assumed both of the tpas and the terms of the tpas were modified 
the settlement agreement also provided that pepco has an allowed  pre petition general unsecured claim against mirant corporation in the amount of million the pepco tpa claim 
pepco has also asserted the pepco tpa claim against other mirant entities that pepco believes are liable to pepco under the terms of the asset purchase and sale agreement s assignment and assumption agreement the assignment agreement 
under the assignment agreement  pepco believes that each of the mirant entities assumed and agreed to discharge certain liabilities and obligations of pepco as defined in the asset purchase and sale agreement 
mirant has filed objections to these claims 
under the current plan of reorganization filed by the mirant entities with the bankruptcy court  certain mirant entities other than mirant corporation would pay significantly higher portions of the claims of their creditors than would mirant corporation 
the amount that pepco will be able to recover from the mirant bankruptcy estate with respect to the pepco tpa claim will depend on the amount of assets available for distribution to creditors of the mirant entities that are found to be liable for the pepco tpa claim 
power purchase agreements under agreements with firstenergy corp  formerly ohio edison firstenergy  and allegheny energy  inc  both entered into in  pepco is obligated to purchase from firstenergy megawatts of capacity and energy annually through december the firstenergy ppa 
under an agreement with panda  entered into in  pepco is obligated to purchase from panda megawatts of capacity and energy annually through the panda ppa 
in each case  the purchase price is substantially in excess of current market price 
as a part of the asset purchase and sale agreement  pepco entered into a back to back arrangement with mirant 
under this arrangement  mirant is obligated  among other things  to purchase from pepco the capacity and energy that pepco is obligated to purchase under the firstenergy ppa and the panda ppa at a price equal to the price pepco is obligated to pay under the firstenergy ppa and the panda ppa the ppa related oblig ations 
pepco pre petition claims when mirant filed its bankruptcy petition on july   mirant had unpaid obligations to pepco of approximately million  consisting primarily of payments due to pepco in respect of the ppa related obligations the mirant pre petition obligations 
the mirant pre petition obligations constitute part of the indebtedness for which mirant is seeking relief in its bankruptcy proceeding 
pepco has filed proofs of claim in the mirant bankruptcy proceeding in the amount of approximately million to recover this indebtedness  however  the amount of pepco s recovery  if any  is uncertain 
the million difference between mirant s unpaid obligation to pepco and the million proofs of claim primarily represents a tpa settlement adjustment which is included in the million proofs of claim filed by pepco against the mirant debtors in respect of the pepco tpa claim 
in view of this uncertainty  pepco  in the third quarter of  expen sed million to establish a reserve against the million receivable from mirant 
in january  pepco paid approximately million to panda in settlement of certain billing disputes under the panda ppa that related to periods after the sale of pepco s generation assets to mirant 
pepco believes that under the terms of the asset purchase and sale agreement  mirant is obligated to reimburse pepco for the settlement payment 
accordingly  in the first quarter of  pepco increased the amount of the receivable due from mirant by approximately million and amended its proofs of claim to include this amount 
pepco currently estimates that the million expensed in the third quarter of represents the portion of the entire million receivable unlikely to be recovered in bankruptcy  and no additional reserve has been established for the million increase in the receivable 
the amount expensed represents pepco s estimate of the possible outcome in bankruptcy  although the amou nt ultimately recovered could be higher or lower 
mirant s attempt to reject the ppa related obligations on august   mirant filed with the bankruptcy court a motion seeking authorization to reject its ppa related obligations 
upon motions filed with the us district court for the northern district of texas the district court by pepco and ferc  in october  the district court withdrew jurisdiction over the rejection proceedings from the bankruptcy court 
in december  the district court denied mirant s motion to reject the ppa related obligations on jurisdictional grounds 
the district court s decision was appealed by mirant and the official committee of unsecured creditors of mirant corporation the creditors committee to the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit the court of appeals 
on august   the court of appeals remanded the case to the district court saying that the district court has jurisdiction to rule on the merits of mirant s rejection motion  suggesting that in doing so the court apply a more rigorous standard than the business judgment rule usually applied by bankruptcy courts in ruling on rejection motions 
on december   the district court issued an order again denying mirant s motion to reject the ppa related obligations 
the district court found that the ppa related obligations are not severable from the asset purchase and sale agreement and that the asset purchase and sale agreement cannot be rejected in part  as mirant was seeking to do 
on december  the creditors committee appealed the district court s order to the court of appeals  and on december   mirant also appealed the district court s order 
as more fully discussed below  mirant had been making regular periodic payments in respect of the ppa related obligations 
on december   mirant filed a notice with the bankruptcy court that it was suspending payments to pepco in respect of the ppa related obligations 
on december   mirant failed to make a payment of approximately million due to pepco for the period november  to november  mirant failed to make that payment 
on december   pepco received a payment of approximately million from mirant  which according to mirant represented the market value of the power for which payment was due on december mirant has informed pepco that it intends to continue to pay the market value  but not the above market portion  of the power purchased under the ppa related obligations 
pepco disagrees with mirant s assertion that it need only pay the market value and believes that the amount repr esenting the market value calculated by mirant is insufficient 
on january   mirant made a approximately million  which  according to mirant  includes the payment for the firstenergy ppa for december and includes the december tpa revenue in the amount of  the tpa costs in the amount of  and an allocated share of 
firstenergy s 
ppa bill credits charges in the amount of 
pepco disputes mirant s contention that the amount paid reflects the full amount due pepco under these agreements for the applicable periods 
as of march   mirant has withheld payment of approximately million due to pepco under the ppa related obligations 
on january   mirant filed in the bankruptcy court a motion seeking to reject certain of its ongoing obligations under the asset purchase and sale agreement  including the ppa related obligations 
on march  as amended by order dated march   the district court granted pepco s motion to withdraw jurisdiction over the asset purchase and sale agreement rejection proceedings from the bankruptcy court 
in addition  the district court ordered mirant to pay on march   all past due unpaid amounts under the ppa related obligations 
mirant has filed a motion for reconsideration and a stay of the march  order 
pepco is exercising all available legal remedies and vigorously opposing mirant s attempt to reject the ppa related obligations and other obligations under the asset purchase and sale agreement in order to protect the interests of its customers and shareholders 
while pepco believes that it has substantial legal bases to oppose the attempt to reject the agreements  the outcome of mirant s efforts to reject the ppa related obligations is uncertain 
if mirant ultimately is successful in rejecting the ppa related obligations  pepco could be required to repay to mirant  for the period beginning on the effective date of the rejection which date could be prior to the date of the court s order and possibly as early as september  and ending on the date mirant is entitled to cease its purchases of energy and capacity from pepco  all amounts paid by mirant to pepco in respect of the ppa related obligations  less an amount equal to the price at which mirant resold the purchased energy and capacity 
pepco estimates that the amount it could be required to repay to mirant in the unlikely event that september   is determined to be the effective date of rejection  is approximately million as of march  assuming mirant continues to withhold unpaid amounts of approximately million as of march  mirant has also indicated to the bankruptcy court that it will move to require pepco to disgorge all amounts paid by mirant to pepco in respect of the ppa related obligations  less an amount equal to the price at which mirant resold the purchased energy and capacity  for the period july  the date on which mirant filed its bankruptcy petition through rejection  if approved  on the theory that mirant did not receive value for those payments 
pepco estimates that the amount it would be required to repay to mirant on the disgorgement theory  in addition to the amounts described above  is approximately million 
any repayment by pepco of amounts paid by mirant would entitle pepco to file a claim against the bankruptcy estate in an amount equal to the amount repaid 
pepco believes that  to the extent such amounts were not recovered from the mirant bankruptcy estate  they would be recoverable as stranded costs from customers through distribution rates as described below 
the following are estimates prepared by pepco of its potential future exposure if mirant s attempt to reject the ppa related obligations ultimately is successful 
these estimates are based in part on current market prices and forward price estimates for energy and capacity  and do not include financing costs  all of which could be subject to significant fluctuation 
the estimates assume no recovery from the mirant bankruptcy estate and no regulatory recovery  either of which would mitigate the effect of the estimated loss 
pepco does not consider it realistic to assume that there will be no such recoveries 
based on these assumptions  pepco estimates that its pre tax exposure as of march   representing the loss of the future benefit of the ppa related obligations to pepco  is as follows if pepco were required to purchase capacity and energy from firstenergy commencing as of march   at the rates provided in the ppa with an average price per kilowatt hour of approximately cents and resold the capacity and energy at market rates projected  given the characteristics of the firstenergy ppa  to be approximately cents per kilowatt hour  pepco estimates that it would cost approximately million for the remainder of  the final year of the firstenergy ppa 
if pepco were required to purchase capacity and energy from panda commencing as of march   at the rates provided in the ppa with an average price per kilowatt hour of approximately cents  and resold the capacity and energy at market rates projected  given the characteristics of the panda ppa  to be approximately cents per kilowatt hour  pepco estimates that it would cost approximately million for the remainder of  approximately million in and  and approximately million to million annually thereafter through the contract termination date 
the ability of pepco to recover from the mirant bankruptcy estate in respect to the mirant pre petition obligations and damages if the ppa related obligations are successfully rejected will depend on whether pepco s claims are allowed  the amount of assets available for distribution to the creditors of the mirant companies determined to be liable for those claims  and pepco s priority relative to other creditors 
at the current stage of the bankruptcy proceeding  there is insufficient information to determine the amount  if any  that pepco might be able to recover from the mirant bankruptcy estate  whether the recovery would be in cash or another form of payment  or the timing of any recovery 
if mirant ultimately is successful in rejecting the ppa related obligations and pepco s full claim is not recovered from the mirant bankruptcy estate  pepco may seek authority from the mpsc and the dcpsc to recover its additional costs 
pepco is committed to working with its regulatory authorities to achieve a result that is appropriate for its shareholders and customers 
under the provisions of the settlement agreements approved by the mpsc and the dcpsc in the deregulation proceedings in which pepco agreed to divest its generation assets under certain conditions  the ppas were to become assets of pepco s distribution business if they could not be sold 
pepco believes that  if mirant ultimately is successful in rejecting the ppa related obligations  these provisions would allow the stranded costs of the ppas that are not recovered from the mirant bankruptcy estate to be recovered from pepco s customers through its distribution rates 
if pe pco s interpretation of the settlement agreements is confirmed  pepco expects to be able to establish the amount of its anticipated recovery as a regulatory asset 
however  there is no assurance that pepco s interpretation of the settlement agreements would be confirmed by the respective public service commissions 
if the ppa related obligations are successfully rejected  and there is no regulatory recovery  pepco will incur a loss 
however  the accounting treatment of such a loss depends on a number of legal and regulatory factors  and is not determinable at this time 
the smeco agreement as a term of the asset purchase and sale agreement  pepco assigned to mirant a facility and capacity agreement with southern maryland electric cooperative  inc smeco under which pepco was obligated to purchase the capacity of an megawatt combustion turbine installed and owned by smeco at a former pepco generating facility the smeco agreement 
the smeco agreement expires in and contemplates a monthly payment to smeco of approximately 
million 
pepco is responsible to smeco for the performance of the smeco agreement if mirant fails to perform its obligations thereunder 
at this time  mirant continues to make post petition payments due to smeco 
on march   mirant filed a complaint with the bankruptcy court seeking a declaratory judgment that the facility and capacity credit agreement is an unexpired lease of non residential real property rather than an executory contract and that if mirant were to successfully reject the agreement  any claim against the bankruptcy estate for damages made by smeco or by pepco as subrogee would be subject to the provisions of the bankruptcy code that limit the recovery of rejection damages by lessors 
pepco believes that there is no reasonable factual or legal basis to support mirant s contention that the smeco agreement is a lease of real property 
litigation continues and the outcome of this proceeding cannot be predicted 
rate proceedings in compliance with the settlement approved by the mpsc in connection with the merger of pepco and conectiv  on december   pepco submitted testimony and supporting schedules to review and reset if necessary its electricity distribution rates in maryland to be effective july   when the then current distribution rate freeze caps ended 
pepco s filing demonstrated that it was in an under earning situation 
however the merger settlement provided that pepco s distribution rates after july  could only remain the same or be decreased 
with limited exceptions  pepco cannot increase its distribution rates until january  in an order dated july  the mpsc affirmed the hearing examiner s recommendation that no rate decrease was warranted at that time 
on july   pepco filed a distribution rate review case with the dcpsc as required by the terms of the pepco conectiv merger settlement approved by the dcpsc 
this case will determine whether pepco s distribution rates will be decreased 
in accordance with the terms of the merger settlement  pepco s distribution rates cannot be increased as a result of the case 
on november   the dcpsc issued an order that designated the issues to be considered in the case and set the hearing schedule 
on december   pepco filed supplemental direct testimony addressing the dcpsc designated issues 
pepco s filings indicate that no rate decrease is warranted 
on march   the dcpsc issued an order granting a joint motion filed on march   on behalf of pepco and several other parties in the case to suspend the procedural schedule to allow the parties to focus on completing settlement discussions 
in the joint motion  the movin g parties informed the dcpsc that they had agreed in principle to settlement provisions that would resolve all issues in the proceeding and that a settlement agreement could be filed in the near future 
divestiture cases district of columbia final briefs on pepco s district of columbia divestiture proceeds sharing application were filed on july  following an evidentiary hearing in june that application was filed to implement a provision of pepco s dcpsc approved divestiture settlement that provided for a sharing of any net proceeds from the sale of pepco s generation related assets 
one of the principal issues in the case is whether pepco should be required to share with customers the excess deferred income taxes edit and accumulated deferred investment tax credits aditc associated with the sold assets and  if so  whether such sharing would violate the normalization provisions of the internal revenue code and its implementing regulations 
the district of columbia allocated portions of edit and aditc associated with the divested generation assets were approximately million and million  respectively 
on march   the internal revenue service irs issued a notice of proposed rulemaking nopr that is relevant to that principal issue 
comments on the nopr were filed by several parties on june   and the irs held a public hearing on june  as a result of the nopr  three of the parties in the divestiture case filed comments with the dcpsc urging the dcpsc to decide the tax issues now on the basis of the proposed rule 
pepco filed comments with the dcpsc in reply to those comments  in which pepco stated that the courts have held and the irs has stated that proposed rules are not authoritative and that no decision should be issued on the basis of proposed rules 
instead  pepco argued that the only prudent course of action is for the dcpsc to await the issuance of final regulations relating to the tax issues and then allow the parties to file supplemental briefs on the tax issues 
pepco cannot predict whether the irs will adopt the regulations as proposed  make changes before issuing final regulations or decide not to adopt regulations 
other issues in the proceeding deal with the treatment of internal costs and cost allocations as deductions from the gross proceeds of the divestiture 
pepco believes that a sharing of edit and aditc would violate the normalization rules 
if pepco were required to share edit and aditc and  as a result  the normalization rules were violated  pepco would be unable to use accelerated depreciation on district of columbia allocated or assigned property 
pepco  in addition to sharing with customers the generation related aditc balance  would have to pay to the irs an amount equal to pepco s million district of columbia jurisdictional generation related aditc balance as well as its district of columbia jurisdictional transmission and distribution related aditc balance as of the later of the date a dcpsc order is issued and all rights to appeal have been exhausted or lapsed  or the date the dcpsc order becomes operative 
as of december   the district of columbia jurisdictional transmission and distribution related aditc balance was approximately million 
pepco believes that its calculation of the district of columbia customers share of divestiture proceeds is correct 
however  depending on the ultimate outcome of this proceeding  pepco could be required to make additional gain sharing payments to dc customers  including the payments described above related to edit and aditc 
such additional payments which  other than the edit and aditc related payments  cannot be estimated would be charged to expense in the quarter and year in which a final decision is rendered and could have a material adverse effect on pepco s and phi s results of operations for those periods 
however  neither phi nor pepco believes that additional gain sharing payments  if any  or the aditc related payments to the irs  if required  would have a material adverse impact on its financial condition 
it is uncertain when the dcpsc will issue a decision 
maryland pepco filed its divestiture proceeds plan application in maryland in april reply briefs were filed in may the principal issue in the maryland case is the same edit and aditc sharing issue that was raised in the dc case 
as of december   the maryland allocated portions of edit and aditc associated with the divested generation assets were approximately million and million  respectively 
other issues deal with the treatment of certain costs as deductions from the gross proceeds of the divestiture 
in november  the hearing examiner in the maryland proceeding issued a proposed order that concluded that pepco s maryland divestiture settlement agreement provided for a sharing between pepco and customers of the edit and aditc associated with the sold assets 
pepco believes that such a sharing would violate the normalization rules and would result in pepco s inability to use accelerated depreciation on maryland allocated or assigned property 
if the proposed order is affirmed  pepco would have to share with its maryland customers  on an approximately basis  the maryland allocated portion of the generation related edit  ie  million  and the generation related aditc 
if such sharing were to violate the normalization rules  pepco  in addition to sharing with customers an amount equal to approximately percent of the generation related aditc balance  would be unable to use accelerated depreciation on maryland allocated or assigned property 
furthermore  pepco would have to pay to the irs an amount equal to pepco s million maryland jurisdictional generation related aditc balance  as well as its maryland retail jurisdictional aditc transmission and distribution related balance as of the later of the date a mpsc order is issued and all rights to appeal have been exhausted or lapsed  or the date the mpsc order becomes operative 
as of december   the maryland retail jurisdictional transmission and distribution related aditc balance was approximately million 
the hearing examiner decided all other issues in favor of pepco  except that only one half of the severance payments that pepco included in its calculation of corporate reorga nization costs should be deducted from the sales proceeds before sharing of the net gain between pepco and customers 
see also the disclosure above under divestiture cases district of columbia regarding the march  irs nopr 
under maryland law  if the proposed order is appealed to the mpsc  the proposed order is not a final  binding order of the mpsc and further action by the mpsc is required with respect to this matter 
pepco has appealed the hearing examiner s decision on the treatment of edit and aditc and corporate reorganization costs to the mpsc 
pepco cannot predict what the outcome of the appeal will be or when the appeal might be decided 
pepco believes that its calculation of the maryland customers share of divestiture proceeds is correct 
however  depending on the ultimate outcome of this proceeding  pepco could be required to share with its customers approximately percent of the edit and aditc balances described above and make additional gain sharing payments related to the disallowed severance payments 
such additional payments would be charged to expense in the quarter and year in which a final decision is rendered and could have a material a dverse effect on results of operations for those periods 
however  neither phi nor pepco believes that additional gain sharing payments  if any  or the aditc related payments to the irs  if required  would have a material adverse impact on its financial condition 
sos and default service proceedings district of columbia in february  the dcpsc opened a new proceeding to consider issues relating to a the establishment of terms and conditions for providing standard offer service sos in the district of columbia after pepco s obligation to provide sos terminated on february   and b the selection of a new sos provider 
in december  the dcpsc issued an order that set forth the terms and conditions for the selection of a new sos provider s and the provision of sos by pepco on a contingency basis 
in december  the dcpsc also issued an order adopting terms and conditions that would apply if pepco continued as the sos provider after february  in march  the dcpsc issued an order adopting the wholesale sos model  ie  pepco would continue to be the sos provider in the district of columbia after february  this march order  as amended by a dcpsc order issued in july  extends pepco s obligation to provide default electricity supply at market rates for up to an additional months for small commercial and residential customers  and for an additional months for large commercial customers 
in august  the dcpsc issued an order adopting administrative charges for residential  small and large commercial dc sos customers that are intended to allow pepco to recover the administrative costs incurred to provide the sos supply 
the approved administrative charges include an average margin for pepco of approximately per kilowatt hour  calculated based on total sales to residential  small and large commercial dc sos customers over the twelve months ended december  because margins vary by customer class  the actual average margin over any given time period will depend on the number of dc sos customers from each customer class and the load taken by such customers over the time period 
the administrative charges went into effect for pepco s dc sos sales on february  pepco completed the first competitive procurement process for dc sos at the end of october and filed the proposed new sos rates with the dcpsc on november  the tpa with mirant under which pepco obtained the fixed rate dc sos supply ended on january   while the new sos supply contracts with the winning bidders in the competitive procurement process began on february  pepco procured power separately on the market for next day deliveries to cover the period from january through january   before the new dc sos contracts began 
consequently  pepco had to pay the difference between the procurement cost of power on the market for next day deliveries and the current dc sos rates charged to customers during the period from january through january  in addition  because the new dc sos rates did not go into effect until february   pepco had to pay the difference between the procurement cost of power under the new dc sos contracts and the dc sos rates charged to customers for the period from february to february  the total amount of the diff erence is estimated to be approximately million 
this difference  however  will be included in the calculation of the generation procurement credit gpc for dc for the period february  through february  the gpc provides for a sharing between pepco s customers and shareholders  on an annual basis  of any margins  but not losses  that pepco earned providing sos in the district of columbia during the four year period from february  through february  currently  based on the rates paid by pepco to mirant under the tpa settlement  there is no customer sharing 
however  in the event that pepco were to ultimately realize a significant recovery from the mirant bankruptcy estate associated with the tpa settlement  the gpc would be recalculated  and the amount of customer sharing with respect to such recovery would be reduced because of the million loss being included in the gpc calculation 
maryland under a settlement approved by the mpsc in april addressing sos service in maryland following the expiration of pepco s fixed rate default supply obligations in july  pepco is required to provide default electricity supply at market rates to residential and small commercial customers through may  to medium sized commercial customers through may  and to large commercial customers through may in accordance with the settlement  pepco purchases the power supply required to satisfy its market rate default supply obligations from wholesale suppliers under contracts entered into pursuant to a competitive bid procedure approved by the mpsc 
pepco is entitled to recover from its default supply customers the cost of the default supply plus an average margin of per kilowatt hour  calculated based on total sales to residential  small and large commercial maryland sos customers over the twelve months ended december  because margins vary by customer class  the actual average margin over any given time period will depend on the number of maryland sos customers from each customer class and the load taken by such customers over the time period 
general litigation asbestos during  pepco was served with amended complaints filed in the state circuit courts of prince george s county  baltimore city and baltimore county  maryland in separate ongoing  consolidated proceedings known as in re personal injury asbestos case 
pepco and other corporate entities were brought into these cases on a theory of premises liability 
under this theory  plaintiffs argue that pepco was negligent in not providing a safe work environment for employees or its contractors  who allegedly were exposed to asbestos while working on pepco s property 
initially  a total of approximately individual plaintiffs added pepco to their complaints 
while the pleadings are not entirely clear  it appears that each plaintiff sought million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages from each defendant 
since the initial filings in  additional individual suits have been filed against pepco  and significant numbers of cases have been dismissed 
as a result of two motions to dismiss  numerous hearings and meetings and one motion for summary judgment  pepco has had approximately of these cases successfully dismissed with prejudice  either voluntarily by the plaintiff or by the court 
of the approximately remaining asbestos cases pending against pepco  approximately cases were filed after december   and have been tendered to mirant for defense and indemnification pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase and sale agreement 
while the aggregate amount of monetary damages sought in the remaining suits excluding those tendered to mirant exceeds million  pepco believes the amounts claimed by current plaintiffs are greatly exaggerated 
the amount of total liability  if any  and any related insurance recovery cannot be determined at this time  however  based on information and relevant circumstances known at this time  pepco does not believe these suits will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition 
however  if an unfavorable decision were rendered against pepco  it could have a material adverse effect on pepco s and phi s results of operations 
environmental litigation pepco is subject to regulation by various federal  regional  state  and local authorities with respect to the environmental effects of its operations  including air and water quality control  solid and hazardous waste disposal  and limitations on land use 
in addition  federal and state statutes authorize governmental agencies to compel responsible parties to clean up certain abandoned or unremediated hazardous waste sites 
pepco may incur costs to clean up currently or formerly owned facilities or sites found to be contaminated  as well as other facilities or sites that may have been contaminated due to past disposal practices 
in october  pepco received notice from the environmental protection agency epa that it  along with several hundred other companies  might be a potentially responsible party prp in connection with the spectron superfund site in elkton  maryland 
the site was operated as a hazardous waste disposal  recycling and processing facility from to in august  pepco entered into a consent decree for de minimis parties with epa to resolve its liability at this site 
under the terms of the consent decree  which was approved by the us district court for the district of maryland on march   pepco made de minimis payments to the united states and a group of prps 
in return  those parties agreed not to sue pepco for past and future costs of remediation at the site and the united states will also provide protection against third party claims for contributions related to response actions at the site 
the consent decree does not cover any damages to natural resources 
however  pepco believes that any liability that it might incur due to natural resource damage at this site would not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
in the early s  pepco sold scrap transformers  some of which may have contained some level of pcbs  to a metal reclaimer operating at the metal bank cottman avenue site in philadelphia  pennsylvania  owned by a nonaffiliated company 
in december  pepco was notified by epa that it  along with a number of other utilities and non utilities  was a prp in connection with the pcb contamination at the site 
in october  remedial investigation feasibility study including a number of possible remedies was submitted to the epa 
in december  the epa issued a record of decision that set forth a selected remedial action plan with estimated implementation costs of approximately million 
in june  the epa issued a unilateral administrative order to pepco and other prps to conduct the design and actions called for in its decision 
on may   two of the potentially liable owner operator entities filed for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
on october   the bankruptcy court confirmed a reorganization plan that incorporates the terms of a settlement among the debtors  the united states and a group of utility prps including pepco 
under the settlement  the reorganized entity site owner will pay a total of million to remediate the site 
as of december   pepco had accrued million to meet its liability for a site remedy 
at the present time  it is not possible to estimate the total extent of epa s administrative and oversight costs or the expense associated with a site remedy ultimately implemented 
however  pepco believes that its liability at this site will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
on april   approximately  gallons of oil leaked from a pipeline at a generating facility that was owned by pepco at chalk point generating facility in aquasco  maryland 
the pipeline was operated by support terminals services operating partnership lp st services  an unaffiliated pipeline management company 
the oil spread from swanson creek to the patuxent river and several of its tributaries 
the area affected covers portions of miles of shoreline along the patuxent river and approximately acres of marshland adjacent to the chalk point property 
in december  the department of transportation  office of pipeline safety  research and special programs administration ops issued a notice of probable violation  proposed civil penalty and proposed compliance order nopv 
the nopv alleged various deficiencies in compliance with regulations related to spill reporting  operations and maintenance of the pipeline and record keeping  none of which relate to the cause of the spill 
the nopv was issued to both pepco and st services and proposed a civil penalty in the amount of  on june   the ops issued a final order regarding the nopv in this matter 
the final order assessed a total fine of  with  of that amount assessed jointly against pepco and st services and the remaining  assessed solely against st services 
st services subsequently filed a petition for reconsideration 
all penalties were stayed pending the outcome of the petition for rec onsideration 
on february   ops issued a decision on the petition for reconsideration that affirmed the final order 
pepco s share of the  penalty assessed pursuant to the final order amounts to  critical accounting policies general the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates represent those estimates and assumptions that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and that have a material impact on financial condition or operating performance 
accounting policy choices pepco s management believes that based on the nature of the businesses in which its subsidiaries are primarily engaged  pepco holdings has very little choice regarding many of the accounting policies it utilizes 
in that regard  the most significant portion of pepco holdings business consists of its regulated utility operations  which are subject to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
sfas no 
does allow regulated entities  in appropriate circumstances  to establish regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities and to defer the income statement impact of certain costs that are expected to be recovered in future rates 
however  management believes that in the areas that pepco is afforded accounting policy choices  its selection from among the alternatives available generally would not have a material impact on the company s financial con dition or results of operations 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  such as statement of position disclosure of certain significant risks and uncertainties  requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
examples of significant estimates used by pepco holdings include the assessment of contingencies and the need amount for reserves of future receipts from mirant refer to the relationship with mirant section  herein  the calculation of future cash flows and fair value amounts for use in goodwill and asset impairment evaluations  fair value calculations based on estimating market pricing associated with derivative instruments  pension and other post retirement benefits assumptions  unbilled revenue calculations  and judgment involved with assessing the probability of recovery of regulatory assets 
additionally  pepco is subject to legal  regulatory  and other proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business 
we record an estimated liability for these proceedings and claims based upon the probable and reasonably estimatable criteria contained in sfas no 
accounting for contingencies 
although pepco believes tha t its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
long lived assets impairment evaluation pepco believes that the estimates involved in its long lived asset impairment evaluation process represent critical accounting estimates because they i are highly susceptible to change from period to period because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about undiscounted and discounted future cash flows and fair values  which are inherently uncertain  ii actual results could vary from those used in pepco estimates and the impact of such variations could be material  and iii the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on pepco s assets as well as the net loss related to an impairment charge could be material 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  an impairment loss shall only be recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
the asset is deemed to not be recoverable when its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
in order to estimate an asset s future cash flows  pepco considers historical cash flows 
pepco uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors  including forward price curves for energy  fuel costs  legislative initiatives  and operating costs 
pension and other post retirement benefit plans pepco believes that the estimates involved in reporting the costs of providing pension and other post retirement benefits represent critical accounting estimates because i they are based on an actuarial calculation that includes a number of assumptions which are subjective in nature  ii they are dependent on numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience  and iii changes in assumptions could impact pepco s expected future cash funding requirements for the plans and would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations  the reported pension and other post retirement benefit liability on the balance sheet  and the reported annual net periodic pension and other post retirement benefit cost on the income statement 
in terms of quantifying the anticipated impact of a change in assumptions  phi estimates that a 
change in the discount rate used to value the benefit obligations co uld result in a million impact on its consolidated balance sheets and income statements 
additionally  phi estimates that a 
change in the expected return on plan assets could result in a million impact on the consolidated balance sheets and income statements and a 
change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate could result in a 
million impact on its consolidated balance sheets and income statements 
pepco s management consults with its actuaries and investment consultants when selecting its plan assumptions 
pepco follows the guidance of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions  when accounting for these benefits 
under these accounting standards  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
in accordance with these standards  the impact of changes in these assumptions and the difference between actual and expected or estimated results on pension and post retirement obligations is generally recognized over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans rather than immediately recognized in the income statement 
regulation of power delivery operations the requirements of sfas no 
apply to pepco s business 
pepco believes that the judgment involved in accounting for its regulated activities represent critical accounting estimates because i a significant amount of judgment is required including but not limited to the interpretation of laws and regulatory commission orders to assess the probability of the recovery of regulatory assets  ii actual results and interpretations could vary from those used in pepco s estimates and the impact of such variations could be material  and iii the impact that writing off a regulatory asset would have on pepco s assets and the net loss related to the charge could be material 
risk factors the business of pepco is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including the events or conditions identified below 
the occurrence of one or more of these events or conditions could have an adverse effect on the business of pepco  including  depending on the circumstances  its results of operations and financial condition 
pepco is a public utility that is subject to substantial governmental regulation 
if pepco receives unfavorable regulatory treatment  pepco s business could be negatively affected 
pepco s utility business is subject to regulation by various federal  state and local regulatory agencies that significantly affects its operations 
pepco s operations are regulated in maryland by the mpsc and in washington  dc by the dcpsc with respect to  among other things  the rates it can charge retail customers for the delivery of electricity 
in addition  the rates that pepco can charge for electricity transmission are regulated by ferc 
pepco cannot change delivery or transmission rates without approval by the applicable regulatory authority 
while the approved delivery and transmission rates are intended to permit pepco to recover its costs of service and earn a reasonable rate of return  pepco s profitability is affected by the rates it is able to charge 
in addition  if the costs incurred by pepco in operating its transmission and distribution facilities exceed the allowed amounts for costs included in the approved rate s  pepco s financial results will be adversely affected 
pepco also is required to have numerous permits  approvals and certificates from governmental agencies that regulate its business 
pepco believes that it has obtained or sought renewal of the material permits  approvals and certificates necessary for its existing operations and that its business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws  however  pepco is unable to predict the impact of future regulatory activities of any of these agencies on its business 
changes in or reinterpretations of existing laws or regulations  or the imposition of new laws or regulations  may require pepco to incur additional expenses or to change the way it conducts its operations 
pepco s business could be adversely affected by the mirant bankruptcy 
in  pepco sold substantially all of its electricity generation assets to mirant 
as part of the sale  pepco entered into several ongoing contractual arrangements with mirant and certain of its subsidiaries 
on july   mirant and most of its subsidiaries filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court for the northern district of texas 
depending on the outcome of the proceedings  the mirant bankruptcy could adversely affect pepco s business 
see relationship with mirant corporation 
pepco could be required to make additional divestiture proceeds gain sharing payments to customers in the district of columbia and maryland 
pepco currently is involved in regulatory proceedings in maryland and the district of columbia related to the sharing of the net proceeds from the sale of its generation related assets 
the principal issue in the proceedings is whether pepco should be required to share with customers the excess deferred income taxes and accumulated deferred investment tax credits associated with the sold assets and  if so  whether such sharing would violate the normalization provisions of the internal revenue code and its implementing regulations 
depending on the outcome of the proceedings  pepco could be required to make additional gain sharing payments to customers and payments to the irs in the amount of the associated accumulated deferred investment tax credits  and pepco might be unable to use accelerated depreciation on district of columbia and maryland allocated or assigned property 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition an d results of operations regulatory and other matters 
the operating results of pepco fluctuate on a seasonal basis and can be adversely affected by changes in weather 
pepco s electric utility business is seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on its operating performance 
demand for electricity is generally greater in the summer months associated with cooling and the winter months associated with heating as compared to other times of the year 
accordingly  pepco historically has generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer 
pepco s facilities may not operate as planned or may require significant maintenance expenditures  which could decrease its revenues or increase its expenses 
operation of transmission and distribution facilities involves many risks  including the breakdown or failure of equipment  accidents  labor disputes and performance below expected levels 
older facilities and equipment  even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices  may require significant capital expenditures for additions or upgrades to keep them operating at peak efficiency  to comply with changing environmental requirements  or to provide reliable operations 
natural disasters and weather related incidents  including tornadoes  hurricanes and snow and ice storms  also can disrupt transmission and distribution delivery systems 
operation of transmission and distribution facilities below expected capacity levels can reduce revenues and result in the incurrence of additional expenses that may not be recoverable from customers or through insurance 
furthermore  if pepco is unable to perform its contractual obligat ions for any of these reasons  it may incur penalties or damages 
pepco s transmission facilities are interconnected with the facilities of other transmission facility owners whose actions could have a negative impact on pepco s operations 
the transmission facilities of pepco are directly interconnected with the transmission facilities of contiguous utilities and as such are part of an interstate power transmission grid 
ferc has designated a number of regional transmission operators to coordinate the operation of portions of the interstate transmission grid 
pepco is a member of pjm  which is the regional transmission operator that coordinates the movement of electricity in all or parts of delaware  maryland  new jersey  ohio  pennsylvania  virginia  west virginia and the district of columbia 
pepco operates its transmission facilities under the direction and control of pjm 
pjm and the other regional transmission operators have established sophisticated systems that are designed to ensure the reliability of the operation of transmission facilities and prevent the operations of one utility from having an adverse impact on the operations of the other utilities 
howeve r  the systems put in place by pjm and the other regional transmission operators may not always be adequate to prevent problems at other utilities from causing service interruptions in the transmission facilities of pepco 
if pepco were to suffer such a service interruption  it could have a negative impact on its business 
the cost of compliance with environmental laws is significant and new environmental laws may increase pepco s expenses 
pepco s operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental statutes  rules and regulations  relating to air quality  water quality  waste management  natural resources  site remediation  and health and safety 
these laws and regulations require pepco to incur expenses to  among other things  conduct site remediation and perform environmental monitoring 
pepco also may be required to pay significant remediation costs with respect to third party sites 
if pepco fails to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations  even if caused by factors beyond its control  such failure could result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities and the need to expend significant sums to come into compliance 
in addition  pepco incurs costs to obtain and comply with a variety of environmental permits  licenses  inspections and other approvals 
if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if pepco fails to obtain  maintain or comply with any such approval  operations at affected facilities could be halted or subjected to additional costs 
new environmental laws and regulations  or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations  could impose more stringent limitations on pepco s operations or require it to incur significant additional costs 
pepco s current compliance strategy may not successfully address the relevant standards and interpretations of the future 
changes in technology may adversely affect pepco s electricity delivery businesses 
increased conservation efforts and advances in technology could reduce demand for electricity supply and distribution  which could adversely affect pepco s business 
in addition  changes in technology also could alter the channels through which retail electric customers buy electricity  which could adversely affect pepco s business 
acts of terrorism could adversely affect pepco s business 
the threat of or actual acts of terrorism may affect pepco s operations in unpredictable ways and may cause changes in the insurance markets  force pepco to increase security measures and cause disruptions of power markets 
if any of pepco s transmission or distribution facilities were to be a direct target  or an indirect casualty  of an act of terrorism  its operations could be adversely affected 
instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism also could affect the ability of pepco to raise needed capital 
pepco s insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all casualty losses that it might incur 
pepco currently has insurance coverage for its facilities and operations in amounts and with deductibles that it considers appropriate 
however  there is no assurance that such insurance coverage will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms 
in addition  some risks  such as weather related casualties  may not be insurable 
in the case of loss or damage to property  plant or equipment  there is no assurance that the insurance proceeds  if any  received will be sufficient to cover the entire cost of replacement or repair 
pepco may be adversely affected by economic conditions 
periods of slowed economic activity generally result in decreased demand for power  particularly by industrial and large commercial customers 
as a consequence  recessions or other downturns in the economy may result in decreased revenues and cash flows for pepco 
pepco is dependent on its ability to successfully access capital markets 
an inability to access capital may adversely affect its business 
pepco relies on access to both short term money markets and longer term capital markets as a source of liquidity and to satisfy its capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from its operations 
capital market disruptions  or a downgrade in pepco s credit ratings  would increase the cost of borrowing or could adversely affect its ability to access one or more financial markets 
disruptions to the capital markets could include  but are not limited to recession or an economic slowdown  the bankruptcy of one or more energy companies  significant increases in the prices for oil or other fuel  a terrorist attack or threatened attacks  or a significant transmission failure 
pepco may be required to  or may elect to  make significant cash contributions to the retirement plan 
pepco follows the guidance of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions in accounting for pension benefits under the retirement plan  a non contributory defined benefit plan in which pepco s employees participate 
in accordance with these accounting standards  pepco makes assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
changes in assumptions such as the use of a different discount rate or expected return on plan assets  affects the calculation of projected benefit obligations  accumulated benefit obligation  reported pension liability on pepco s balance sheet  and reported annual net periodic pension benefit cost on pepco s income statement 
furthermore  as a result of actual pension plan experience being different from expected  the accumulated benefit obligation abo could be greater than the fair value of pension plan assets 
if this were to occur  pepco could be required to recognize an additional minimum liability as prescribed by sfas no 
the liability would be recorded as a reduction to common equity through a charge to other comprehensive income oci  and would not affect net income for the year 
the charge to oci would be restored through common equity in future periods when the fair value of plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation 
phi s funding policy is to make cash contributions to the pension plan sufficient for plan assets to exceed the abo  and avoid the recognition of an additional minimum liability 
use of alternative assumptions could also impact the expected future cash funding requirements for the retirement plan if it did not meet the minimum funding requirements of erisa 
energy companies are subject to adverse publicity  which may render pepco vulnerable to negative regulatory and litigation outcomes 
the energy sector has been among the sectors of the economy that have been the subject of highly publicized allegations of misconduct in recent years 
in addition  many utility companies have been publicly criticized for their performance during recent natural disasters and weather related incidents 
adverse publicity of this nature may render legislatures  regulatory authorities  and tribunals less likely to view energy companies such as pepco in a favorable light and may cause them to be susceptible to adverse outcomes with respect to decisions by such bodies 
because pepco is a wholly owned subsidiary of phi  phi can exercise substantial control over its dividend policy and business and operations 
all of the members of pepco s board of directors  as well as many of pepco s executive officers  are officers of phi 
among other decisions  pepco s board is responsible for decisions regarding payment of dividends  financing and capital raising activities  and acquisition and disposition of assets 
within the limitations of applicable law  including limitations imposed by puhca  and subject to the financial covenants under pepco s outstanding debt instruments  pepco s board of directors will base its decisions concerning the amount and timing of dividends  and other business decisions  on pepco s earnings  cash flow and capital structure  but may also take into account the business plans and financial requirements of phi and its other subsidiaries

risk factors the business of dpl is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including the events or conditions identified below 
the occurrence of one or more of these events or conditions could have an adverse effect on the business of dpl  including  depending on the circumstances  its results of operations and financial condition 
dpl is a public utility that is subject to substantial governmental regulation 
if dpl receives unfavorable regulatory treatment  dpl s business could be negatively affected 
dpl s utility business is subject to regulation by various federal  state and local regulatory agencies that significantly affects its operations 
dpl s operations are regulated in maryland by the mpsc  in delaware by the dpsc and in virginia by the vscc with respect to  among other things  the rates it can charge retail customers for the delivery of electricity and gas 
in addition  the rates that dpl can charge for electricity transmission are regulated by ferc 
dpl cannot change delivery or transmission rates without approval by the applicable regulatory authority 
while the approved delivery and transmission rates are intended to permit dpl to recover its costs of service and earn a reasonable rate of return  dpl s profitability is affected by the rates it is able to charge 
in addition  if the costs incurred by dpl in operating its transmission and distribution facilities exceed the allowed amounts for costs included in the approved r ates  dpl s financial results will be adversely affected 
dpl also is required to have numerous permits  approvals and certificates from governmental agencies that regulate its business 
dpl believes that it has obtained or sought renewal of the material permits  approvals and certificates necessary for its existing operations and that its business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws  however  dpl is unable to predict the impact of future regulatory activities of any of these agencies on its business 
changes in or reinterpretations of existing laws or regulations  or the imposition of new laws or regulations  may require dpl to incur additional expenses or to change the way it conducts its operations 
the operating results of dpl fluctuate on a seasonal basis and can be adversely affected by changes in weather 
dpl s utility businesses are seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on its operating performance 
demand for electricity is generally greater in the summer months associated with cooling and demand for electricity and gas is generally greater in the winter months associated with heating as compared to other times of the year 
accordingly  dpl historically has generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer 
dpl s facilities may not operate as planned or may require significant maintenance expenditures  which could decrease its revenues or increase its expenses 
operation of transmission and distribution facilities involves many risks  including the breakdown or failure of equipment  accidents  labor disputes and performance below expected levels 
older facilities and equipment  even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices  may require significant capital expenditures for additions or upgrades to keep them operating at peak efficiency  to comply with changing environmental requirements  or to provide reliable operations 
natural disasters and weather related incidents  including tornadoes  hurricanes and snow and ice storms  also can disrupt transmission and distribution delivery systems 
operation of transmission and distribution facilities below expected capacity levels can reduce revenues and result in the incurrence of additional expenses that may not be recoverable from customers or through insurance 
furthermore  if dpl is unable to perform its contractual obligations for any of these reasons  it may incur penalties or damages 
dpl s transmission facilities are interconnected with the facilities of other transmission facility owners whose actions could have a negative impact on dpl s operations 
the electricity transmission facilities of dpl are directly interconnected with the transmission facilities of contiguous utilities and as such are part of an interstate power transmission grid 
ferc has designated a number of regional transmission operators to coordinate the operation of portions of the interstate transmission grid 
dpl is a member of pjm  which is the regional transmission operator that coordinates the movement of electricity in all or parts of delaware  maryland  new jersey  ohio  pennsylvania  virginia  west virginia and the district of columbia 
dpl operates its transmission facilities under the direction and control of pjm 
pjm and the other regional transmission operators have established sophisticated systems that are designed to ensure the reliability of the operation of transmission facilities and prevent the operations of one utility from having an adverse impact on the operations of the other utilities 
however  the systems put in place by pjm and the other regional transmission operators may not always be adequate to prevent problems at other utilities from causing service interruptions in the transmission facilities of dpl 
if dpl were to suffer such a service interruption  it could have a negative impact on its business 
the cost of compliance with environmental laws is significant and new environmental laws may increase dpl s expenses 
dpl s operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental statutes  rules and regulations  relating to air quality  water quality  spill prevention  waste management  natural resources  site remediation  and health and safety 
these laws and regulations require dpl to incur expenses to  among other things  conduct site remediation and obtain permits 
dpl also may be required to pay significant remediation costs with respect to third party sites 
if dpl fails to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations  even if caused by factors beyond its control  such failure could result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities and the need to expend significant sums to come into compliance 
in addition  dpl incurs costs to obtain and comply with a variety of environmental permits  licenses  inspections and other approvals 
if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if dpl fails to obtain  maintain or comply with any such approval  operations at affected facilities could be halted or subjected to additional costs 
new environmental laws and regulations  or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations  could impose more stringent limitations on dpl s operations or require it to incur significant additional costs 
dpl s current compliance strategy may not successfully address the relevant standards and interpretations of the future 
changes in technology may adversely affect dpl s electricity and gas delivery businesses 
increased conservation efforts and advances in technology could reduce demand for electricity and gas supply and distribution  which could adversely affect dpl s business 
in addition  changes in technology also could alter the channels through which retail electric customers buy electricity  which could adversely affect dpl s business 
acts of terrorism could adversely affect dpl s business 
the threat of or actual acts of terrorism may affect dpl s operations in unpredictable ways and may cause changes in the insurance markets  force dpl to increase security measures and cause disruptions of power markets 
if any of dpl s transmission or distribution facilities were to be a direct target  or an indirect casualty  of an act of terrorism  its operations could be adversely affected 
instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism also could affect the ability of dpl to raise needed capital 
dpl s insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all casualty losses that it might incur 
dpl currently has insurance coverage for its facilities and operations in amounts and with deductibles that it considers appropriate 
however  there is no assurance that such insurance coverage will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms 
in addition  some risks  such as weather related casualties  may not be insurable 
in the case of loss or damage to property  plant or equipment  there is no assurance that the insurance proceeds  if any  received will be sufficient to cover the entire cost of replacement or repair 
dpl may be adversely affected by economic conditions 
periods of slowed economic activity generally result in decreased demand for power  particularly by industrial and large commercial customers 
as a consequence  recessions or other downturns in the economy may result in decreased revenues and cash flows for dpl 
dpl is dependent on its ability to successfully access capital markets 
an inability to access capital may adversely affect its business 
dpl relies on access to both short term money markets and longer term capital markets as a source of liquidity and to satisfy its capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from its operations 
capital market disruptions  or a downgrade in dpl s credit ratings  would increase the cost of borrowing or could adversely affect its ability to access one or more financial markets 
disruptions to the capital markets could include  but are not limited to recession or an economic slowdown  the bankruptcy of one or more energy companies  significant increases in the prices for oil or other fuel  a terrorist attack or threatened attacks  or a significant transmission failure 
dpl may be required to  or may elect to  make significant cash contributions to the retirement plan 
dpl follows the guidance of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions in accounting for pension benefits under the retirement plan  a non contributory defined benefit plan in which dpl s employees participate 
in accordance with these accounting standards  dpl makes assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
changes in assumptions such as the use of a different discount rate or expected return on plan assets  affects the calculation of projected benefit obligations  accumulated benefit obligation  reported pension liability on dpl s balance sheet  and reported annual net periodic pension benefit cost on dpl s income statement 
furthermore  as a result of actual pension plan experience being different from expected  the accumulated benefit obligation abo could be greater than the fair value of pension plan assets 
if this were to occur  dpl could be required to recognize an additional minimum liability as prescribed by sfas no 
the liability would be recorded as a reduction to common equity through a charge to other comprehensive income oci  and would not affect net income for the year 
the charge to oci would be restored through common equity in future periods when the fair value of plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation 
phi s funding policy is to make cash contributions to the pension plan sufficient for plan assets to exceed the abo  and avoid the recognition of an additional minimum liability 
use of alternative assumptions could also impact the expected future cash funding requirements for the retirement plan if it did not meet the minimum funding requirements of erisa 
energy companies are subject to adverse publicity  which may render dpl vulnerable to negative regulatory and litigation outcomes 
the energy sector has been among the sectors of the economy that have been the subject of highly publicized allegations of misconduct in recent years 
in addition  many utility companies have been publicly criticized for their performance during recent natural disasters and weather related incidents 
adverse publicity of this nature may render legislatures  regulatory authorities  and tribunals less likely to view energy companies such as dpl in a favorable light and may cause them to be susceptible to adverse outcomes with respect to decisions by such bodies 
because dpl is an indirect  wholly owned subsidiary of phi  phi can exercise substantial control over its dividend policy and business and operations 
all of the members of dpl s board of directors  as well as many of dpl s executive officers  are officers of phi 
among other decisions  dpl s board is responsible for decisions regarding payment of dividends  financing and capital raising activities  and acquisition and disposition of assets 
within the limitations of applicable law  including limitations imposed by puhca  and subject to the financial covenants under dpl s outstanding debt instruments  dpl s board of directors will base its decisions concerning the amount and timing of dividends  and other business decisions  on dpl s earnings  cash flow and capital structure  but may also take into account the business plans and financial requirements of phi and its other subsidiaries

additionally  the period contained a million charge related to the new jersey deferral disallowance regarding the procurement of fuel and purchased energy 
customers in new jersey who do not choose a competitive supplier receive default electricity supply from suppliers selected through auctions approved by the njbpu 
ace s rates for the recovery of these costs are reset annually 
on ace s balance sheet a regulatory asset includes an under recovery of million as of december  this amount is net of a million reserve on previously disallowed items under appe al 
gain on sale of assets the gain on sale of assets increase of million in is due to a settlement with the city of vineland  new jersey 
during the second quarter of  ace and the city of vineland finalized condemnation settlement under which ace transferred to the city of vineland its distribution assets within the geographical limits of the city of vineland and related customer accounts 
the transaction resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately million  which is recorded as a reduction to operating expenses in the line item entitled gain on sale of assets on the consolidated statements of earnings 
other income expenses other expenses increased by million to a net expense of million in from a net expense of million in this increase is primarily due to the following i million increase in interest expense on transition bonds issued by ace funding due to additional transition bonds issued in december   partially offset by  ii million decrease in income from customers to recover income tax expense on contributions in aid of construction

extraordinary item in july  the new jersey board of public utilities njbpu approved the determination of stranded costs related to ace s january   petition relating to its bl england generating facility 
the njbpu approved recovery of million 
as a result of the order  ace reversed million of accruals for the possible disallowances related to these stranded costs 
the credit to income of million is classified as an extraordinary gain in ace s financial statements  since the original accrual was part of an extraordinary charge in conjunction with the accounting for competitive restructuring in risk factors the business of ace is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including the events or conditions identified below 
the occurrence of one or more these events or conditions could have an adverse effect on the business of ace  including  depending on the circumstances  its results of operations and financial condition 
ace is a public utility that is subject to substantial governmental regulation 
if ace receives unfavorable regulatory treatment  ace s business could be negatively affected 
ace s utility business is subject to regulation by various federal  state and local regulatory agencies that significantly affects its operations 
ace s operations are regulated by the njbpu with respect to  among other things  the rates it can charge retail customers for the delivery of electricity 
in addition  the rates that ace can charge for electricity transmission are regulated by ferc 
ace cannot change delivery or transmission rates without approval by the applicable regulatory authority 
while the approved delivery and transmission rates are intended to permit ace to recover its costs of service and earn a reasonable rate of return  ace s profitability is affected by the rates it is able to charge 
in addition  if the costs incurred by ace in operating its transmission and distribution facilities exceed the allowed amounts for costs included in the approved rates  ace s financial results will be adversely affected 
ace also is required to have numerous permits  approvals and certificates from governmental agencies that regulate its business 
ace believes that it has obtained or sought renewal of the material permits  approvals and certificates necessary for its existing operations and that its business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws  however  ace is unable to predict the impact of future regulatory activities of any of these agencies on its business 
changes in or reinterpretations of existing laws or regulations  or the imposition of new laws or regulations  may require ace to incur additional expenses or to change the way it conducts its operations 
the operating results of ace fluctuate on a seasonal basis and can be adversely affected by changes in weather 
ace s electric utility business is seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on its operating performance 
demand for electricity is generally greater in the summer months associated with cooling and the winter months associated with heating as compared to other times of the year 
accordingly  ace historically has generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer 
ace s facilities may not operate as planned or may require significant maintenance expenditures  which could decrease its revenues or increase its expenses 
operation of generation  transmission and distribution facilities involves many risks  including the breakdown or failure of equipment  accidents  labor disputes and performance below expected levels 
older facilities and equipment  even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices  may require significant capital expenditures for additions or upgrades to keep them operating at peak efficiency  to comply with changing environmental requirements  or to provide reliable operations 
natural disasters and weather related incidents  including tornadoes  hurricanes and snow and ice storms  also can disrupt generation  transmission and distribution delivery systems 
operation of generation  transmission and distribution facilities below expected capacity levels can reduce revenues and result in the incurrence of additional expenses that may not be recoverable from customers or through insurance 
furthermore  if ace is unable to perf orm its contractual obligations for any of these reasons  it may incur penalties or damages 
ace s transmission facilities are interconnected with the facilities of other transmission facility owners whose actions could have a negative impact on the ace s operations 
the transmission facilities of ace are directly interconnected with the transmission facilities of contiguous utilities and as such are part of an interstate power transmission grid 
ferc has designated a number of regional transmission operators to coordinate the operation of portions of the interstate transmission grid 
ace is a member of pjm  which is the regional transmission operator that coordinates the movement of electricity in all or parts of delaware  maryland  new jersey  ohio  pennsylvania  virginia  west virginia and the district of columbia 
ace operates its transmission facilities under the direction and control of pjm 
pjm and the other regional transmission operators have established sophisticated systems that are designed to ensure the reliability of the operation of transmission facilities and prevent the operations of one utility from having an adverse impact on the operations of the other utilities 
however  the system s put in place by pjm and the other regional transmission operators may not always be adequate to prevent problems at other utilities from causing service interruptions in the transmission facilities of ace 
if ace were to suffer such a service interruption  it could have a negative impact on its business 
the cost of compliance with environmental laws is significant and new environmental laws may increase ace s expenses 
ace s operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental statutes  rules and regulations  relating to air quality  water quality  spill prevention  waste management  natural resources  site remediation  and health and safety 
these laws and regulations require ace to incur expenses to  among other things  conduct site remediation and obtain permits 
ace also may be required to pay significant remediation costs with respect to third party sites 
if ace fails to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations  even if caused by factors beyond its control  such failure could result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities and the need to expend significant sums to come into compliance 
in addition  ace incurs costs to obtain and comply with a variety of environmental permits  licenses  inspections and other approvals 
if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if ace fails to obtain  maintain or comply with any such approval  operations at affected facilities could be halted or subjected to additional costs 
new environmental laws and regulations  or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations  could impose more stringent limitations on ace s operations or require it to incur significant additional costs 
ace s current compliance strategy may not successfully address the relevant standards and interpretations of the future 
changes in technology may adversely affect ace s electricity delivery businesses increased conservation efforts and advances in technology could reduce demand for electricity supply and distribution  which could adversely affect ace s business 
in addition  changes in technology also could alter the channels through which retail electric customers buy electricity  which could adversely affect ace s business 
acts of terrorism could adversely affect ace s business 
the threat of or actual acts of terrorism may affect ace s operations in unpredictable ways and may cause changes in the insurance markets  force ace to increase security measures and cause disruptions of power markets 
if any of ace s generation  transmission or distribution facilities were to be a direct target  or an indirect casualty  of an act of terrorism  its operations could be adversely affected 
instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism also could affect the ability of ace to raise needed capital 
ace s insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all casualty losses that it might incur 
ace currently has insurance coverage for its facilities and operations in amounts and with deductibles that it considers appropriate 
however  there is no assurance that such insurance coverage will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms 
in addition  some risks  such as weather related casualties  may not be insurable 
in the case of loss or damage to property  plant or equipment  there is no assurance that the insurance proceeds  if any  received will be sufficient to cover the entire cost of replacement or repair 
ace may be adversely affected by economic conditions 
periods of slowed economic activity generally result in decreased demand for power  particularly by industrial and large commercial customers 
as a consequence  recessions or other downturns in the economy may result in decreased revenues and cash flows for ace 
ace is dependent on its ability to successfully access capital markets 
an inability to access capital may adversely affect its business 
ace relies on access to both short term money markets and longer term capital markets as a source of liquidity and to satisfy its capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from its operations 
capital market disruptions  or a downgrade in ace s credit ratings  would increase the cost of borrowing or could adversely affect its ability to access one or more financial markets 
disruptions to the capital markets could include  but are not limited to recession or an economic slowdown  the bankruptcy of one or more energy companies  significant increases in the prices for oil or other fuel  a terrorist attack or threatened attacks  or a significant transmission failure 
ace may be required to  or may elect to  make significant cash contributions to the retirement plan 
ace follows the guidance of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions in accounting for pension benefits under the retirement plan  a non contributory defined benefit plan in which ace s employees participate 
in accordance with these accounting standards  ace makes assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
changes in assumptions such as the use of a different discount rate or expected return on plan assets  affects the calculation of projected benefit obligations  accumulated benefit obligation  reported pension liability on ace s balance sheet  and reported annual net periodic pension benefit cost on ace s income statement 
furthermore  as a result of actual pension plan experience being different from expected  the accumulated benefit obligation abo could be greater than the fair value of pension plan assets 
if this were to occur  ace could be required to recognize an additional minimum liability as prescribed by sfas no 
the liability would be recorded as a reduction to common equity through a charge to other comprehensive income oci  and would not affect net income for the year 
the charge to oci would be restored through common equity in future periods when the fair value of plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation 
phi s funding policy is to make cash contributions to the pension plan sufficient for plan assets to exceed the abo  and avoid the recognition of an additional minimum liability 
use of alternative assumptions could also impact the expected future cash funding requirements for the retirement plan if it did not meet the minimum funding requirements of erisa 
energy companies are subject to adverse publicity  which may render ace vulnerable to negative regulatory and litigation outcomes 
the energy sector has been among the sectors of the economy that have been the subject of highly publicized allegations of misconduct in recent years 
in addition  many utility companies have been publicly criticized for their performance during recent natural disasters and weather related incidents 
adverse publicity of this nature may render legislatures  regulatory authorities  and tribunals less likely to view energy companies such as ace in a favorable light and may cause them to be susceptible to adverse outcomes with respect to decisions by such bodies

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk pepco holdings as of march  conectiv energy ceased all proprietary trading activities  which generally consist of the entry into contracts to take a view of market direction  capture market price change  and put capital at risk 
phi s competitive energy segments are no longer engaged in proprietary trading  however  the market exposure under certain contracts entered into prior to cessation of proprietary trading activities was not eliminated due to the illiquid market environment to execute such elimination 
these contracts will remain in place until they are terminated and their values are realized as they mature in the competitive energy segments actively engage in commodity risk management activities to reduce their financial exposure to changes in the value of their assets and obligations due to commodity price fluctuations 
certain of these risk management activities are conducted using instruments classified as derivatives under sfas in addition  the competitive energy segments also manage commodity risk with contracts that are not classified as derivatives 
the competitive energy segments primary risk management objectives are to manage the spread between the cost of fuel used to operate their electric generation plants and the revenue received from the sale of the power produced by those plants and manage the spread between retail sales commitments and the cost of supply used to service those commitments in order to ensure stable and known minimum cash flows and fix favorable prices and margins when they become available 
to a lesser exten t  conectiv energy also engages in market activities in an effort to profit from short term geographical price differentials in electricity prices among markets 
phi collectively refers to these energy market activities  including its commodity risk management activities  as other energy commodity activities and identifies this activity separate from that of the discontinued proprietary trading activity 
phi s risk management policies place oversight at the senior management level through the corporate risk management committee which has the responsibility for establishing corporate compliance requirements for the competitive energy segments energy market participation 
phi uses a value at risk var model to assess the market risk of its competitive energy segments other energy commodity activities and its remaining proprietary trading contracts 
phi also uses other measures to limit and monitor risk in its commodity activities  including limits on the nominal size of positions and periodic loss limits 
var represents the potential mark to market loss on energy contracts or portfolios due to changes in market prices for a specified time period and confidence level 
phi estimates var using a delta gamma variance covariance model with a percent  one tailed confidence level and assuming a one day holding period 
since var is an estimate  it is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur

 including proprietary trading contracts and derivatives associated with other energy commodity activities 
this column represents all energy derivative contracts  normal purchase sales contracts  modeled generation output and fuel requirements and modeled customer load obligations for both the discontinued proprietary trading activity and the ongoing other energy commodity activities 
as var calculations are shown in a standard delta or delta gamma closed form day holding period tail normal distribution form  traditional statistical and financial methods can be employed to reconcile prior k and q vars to the above approach 
in this case  day vars divided by the square root of equal day vars  and tail vars divided by times equal tail vars 
note that these methods of conversion are not valid for converting from day or less holding periods to over month holding periods and should not be applied to non standard closed form var calculations in any case

the competitive energy segments portfolio of electric generating plants includes mid merit assets and peaking assets 
mid merit electric generating plants are typically combined cycle units that can quickly change their megawatt output level on an economic basis 
these plants are generally operated during times when demand for electricity rises and power prices are higher 
the competitive energy segments dynamically economically hedge both the estimated plant output and fuel requirements as the estimated levels of output and fuel needs change 
dynamic or economic hedge percentages include the estimated electricity output of and fuel requirements for the competitive energy segment s generation plants that have been economically hedged and any associated financial or physical commodity contracts including derivative contracts that are classified as cash flow hedges under sfas  other derivative instruments  wholesale normal purchas e and sales contracts  and load service obligations 
as of december   based on economic availability projections  of generation output is economically hedged over the next months 
fuel inputs for the same month period are hedged

the effect of a hypothetical change in interest rates on the annual interest costs for short term and variable rate debt was approximately million as of december  commodity price risk pepco holdings is at risk for a decrease in market liquidity to levels that affect its capability to execute its commodity participation strategies 
phi believes the commodity markets to be sufficiently liquid to support its market participation 
conectiv s participation in wholesale energy markets includes marketing  trading  and arbitrage activities  which expose conectiv to commodity market risk 
to the extent conectiv has net open positions  controls are in place that are intended to keep risk exposures within management approved risk tolerance levels 
conectiv engages in commodity hedging activities to minimize the risk of market fluctuations associated with the purchase and sale of energy commodities natural gas  petroleum  coal and electricity 
the majority of these hedges relate to the procurement of fuel for its power plants  fixing the cash flows from the plant output  and securing power for electric load service 
conectiv s hedging activities are conducted using derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  which are designed to reduce the volatility on future cash flows 
conectiv s energy commodity hedging objectives  in accordance with its risk management pol icy  are primarily the assurance of stable and known cash flows and the fixing of favorable prices and margins when they become available 
conectiv manages to the objective of hedging the variability in future cash flows for forecasted energy output from its generation assets at of such forecasted output over a period of months 
as of december  conectiv s average forecasted hedge position for the forward months was projected to meet that objective 
credit and nonperformance risk certain of phi s subsidiaries agreements may be subject to credit losses and nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements 
however  phi anticipates that the counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the agreements 
phi s subsidiaries attempt to minimize credit risk exposure to wholesale energy counterparties through  among other things  formal credit policies  regular assessment of counterparty creditworthiness that results in the establishment of a credit limit for each counterparty  monitoring procedures that include stress testing  the use of standard agreements which allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty and collateral requirements under certain circumstances  and has established reserves for credit losses 
as of december   credit exposure to wholesale energy counterparties was weighted with investment grade counterparties  with counterparties without external credit quality ratings  and with non investment grade counterparties
