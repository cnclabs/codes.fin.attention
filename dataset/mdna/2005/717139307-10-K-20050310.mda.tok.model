we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations and projections of future events 
such statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are subject to unknown risks  uncertainty and other factors that may cause results to differ materially from those contemplated in such forward looking statements 
in addition  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
executive summary for pharmos  the year ended december  was a period of significant milestones 
during the year  the company completed two clinical trials with dexanabinol and advanced a second drug candidate  cannabinor  to late stage preclinical development 
in november  the exploratory phase iia trial of dexanabinol as a preventative agent against ci following cabg surgery was unblinded 
a statistically significant stroop test was consistent with protection of higher level executive function in the brain 
pharmos is currently considering the clinical and regulatory aspects of future clinical trials for this indication 
in december  the phase iii dexanabinol for severe tbi trial was unblinded 
the data showed that while the quality of the trial met or exceeded expectations  dexanabinol failed to demonstrate efficacy for severe tbi in this trial when dexanabinol was administered within six hours and the clinical outcomes measured at six months 
the tbi program has been discontinued  and detailed results will be reported to the fda and published in the scientific literature 
the results for the year ended december  and were a net loss of million and million or a loss per share of and  respectively 
except for  the company has experienced operating losses every year since inception in funding the research  development and clinical testing of our drug candidates 
as of december   the company s accumulated deficit was approximately million 
the company expects to incur additional losses over the next several years as the company s research and development and clinical trial programs continue 
the company s ability to achieve profitability  if ever  is dependent on its ability to develop and obtain regulatory approvals for its product candidates  to enter into agreements for product development and commercialization with strategic corporate partners and contract to develop or acquire the capacity to manufacture and sell its products

critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
the listing below is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
the company considers certain accounting policies related to the stock based compensation  tax valuation allowance and asset impairments to be critical policies due to the estimation process involved in each 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock options granted to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related interpretations 
pursuant to this method  we measure the intrinsic value of the option on its grant date as the difference between the exercise price of the option and the fair market value of our stock 
we then expense the difference  if any  over the vesting period of the option  on an accelerated basis  in accordance with fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans 
the company adopted the disclosure only requirements of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
if the company had adopted sfas to recognize an expense for options granted to employees and directors under our stock based compensation plans  our earnings would have been materially impacted 
the impact of this method is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
options issued to non employees other than directors are accounted for under the fair value method in accordance with sfas and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services 
under the fair value method  compensation cost is measured at the grant date of the option based on the value of the award using the black scholes method 
compensation cost is periodically remeasured as the underlying options vest in accordance with eitf issue no 
and is recognized over the service period 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r 
this statement is a revision to sfas  supersedes apb  and amends sfas  statement of cash flows 
sfas r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation using the intrinsic value method allowed under apb and requires public companies to recognize such transactions as compensation expense in the statement of operations based on the fair values of such equity on the date of the grant  with the compensation expense recognized over the period in which the recipient is required to provide service in exchange for the equity award 
this statement also provides guidance on valuing and expensing these awards  as well as disclosure requirements of these equity arrangements 
this statement is effective for the first interim reporting period that begins after june   and the company will adopt the statement on july  see recently issued accounting pronouncements 
on september   the board of directors approved the retention award agreements and pharmos entered into retention award agreements with each of dr 
haim aviv  chairman and chief executive officer  and dr 
gad riesenfeld  president and chief operating officer 
the company granted retention awards consisting of cash and restricted stock units to dr 
aviv 
the company granted retention award consisting of cash and restricted stock to dr 
riesenfeld the awards 
one half of the awards shall vest or are scheduled to vest and become non forfeitable on december   and the balance shall vest and become non forfeitable on june   subject to certain accelerated vesting provisions 
the fair value of the restricted shares was based on the fair value of the stock on the issuance date 
the aggregate fair value of the restricted stock awards totaled million 
for financial reporting purposes  the cash awards and the fair value of the restricted stock awards  which totaled  will be expensed pro rata over the vesting periods 
per the awards  only dr 
riesenfeld was issued the restricted stock  dr 
aviv received restricted stock units 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flow to the recorded value of the asset 
subsequent impairment assessments could result in future impairment charges 
any impairment charge would result in the reduction in the carrying value of long lived assets and would increase our net loss in the period in which the charge arose 
tax valuation allowance the company has assessed the likelihood of realizing future taxable income and has determined that a deferred tax valuation allowance is deemed necessary 
in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax asset  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination is made

in december  the company announced the results of the phase iii trial 
despite the high quality of data generated by the investigative sites and a rigorous statistical methodology  no difference between dexanabinol and placebo could be detected

although the trial did not achieve its primary statistical endpoint  the stroop test achieved a statistically and clinically relevant difference 
the results from this trial indicate that the pre frontal region of the brain involved in higher cognitive functions may be the most affected by ci and that dexanabinol may preserve these functions in cs cpb patients
