 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets 
prior year amounts throughout this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations have been restated to reflect the reporting of these operations as discontinued 
year ended december  compared to consolidated net sales increased in to approximately billion from billion in this was due to increased sales in all three of our business segments  which all reported higher net sales in than in sales in our crane segment increased to billion 
the foodservice segment reported net sales for of million  a increase compared to marine had net sales of million in compared to million in the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar positively affected net sales in by approximately million compared to further analysis of the increases in sales by segment is presented in the sales and operating earnings by segment section of this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below 
gross margin decreased in to from in gross profit of all three segments was negatively impacted by increased commodity prices  especially steel  during compared to increased commodity prices caused reductions in profit in for the crane  foodservice and marine segments of million  million and million  respectively  compared to in all cases  the impact of commodity price increases on gross profit is net of price increases to our customers and adjustments to our material standards 
consolidated gross profit for the year ended december  was million  an increase of over the consolidated gross profit for the same period in of million 
in addition to the impact of the increased commodity prices  comparative consolidated gross profit for the years ended december  and was affected by the following items i increased volumes in all three segments in  ii a profitable repair season in the marine segment during the first part of  iii the favorable effects of integration savings  iv favorable product mix and cost reductions implemented in recent years in the foodservice segment  v lower margin commercial construction projects  start up costs on one of our commercial projects at our toledo shipyard  and constructing of first time vessels at our shipyards  all of which negatively impacted our marine segment margins in  vi the effect of the strike at marinette marine in the first quarter of  vii competitive pricing activities in certain regions and with certain products  and viii a strong euro in engineering  selling and administrative expenses es a increased to in compared to million in  a million increase 
as a percentage of sales  es a decreased to in  compared to in approximately million of this increase is the result of the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro during as compared to research and development spending increased approximately million in the crane and foodservice segments for new product introductions 
the crane and foodservice segments introduced and new products  respectively  to their markets during as a result of the increased sales during  selling expenses increased approximately million in compared to corporate expenses increased approximately million in compared to this is primarily the result of a million expense for a sales and use tax settlement incurred in the first quarter of and costs associated with our compliance activities relating to the sarbanes oxley act of the remainder of the increase is primarily the result of higher employee benefit costs in all three segments and corporate 
amortization expense of million during increased over the million reported in this increase was the result of the strengthening of the euro to the us dollar 
restructuring expense of million for is attributable to restructuring in our crane segment in the amount of million and in our foodservice segment of million 
throughout  we continued certain restructuring activities within our crane segment to reduce our overall fixed cost structure 
the foodservice restructuring charge related to the closing of our manufacturing facility in italy 
after taking all of the above matters into account  our consolidated operating earnings from continuing operations for were million  which was higher than consolidated operating earnings for and were both of net sales 
our operating earnings were benefited by the one time impat of million for a curtailment gain of certain of our postretirement benefit plans 
interest expense for was flat at million compared during we made payments on our debt of million 
however  this decrease in debt was offset by the increase in the euro against the us dollar  causing increased expense associated with our euro denominated senior subordinated notes due and increase in market rates 
the weighted average interest rate paid on all outstanding debt at december  was  as compared to at december  during  we recorded a loss of million related to the prepayment of our term loan b facility 
this loss related to the write off of unamortized financing fees and unwinding of our floating to fixed interest rate swap 
the effective income tax rate for continuing operations was  compared to in the effective tax rate benefited from certain global tax planning initiatives and fixed permanent book tax differences 
discontinued operations in include the results of operations of north central crane and our awp business and the gain on the sale of our subsidiary delta manlift 
the discontinued awp business included our delta subsidiary  which was sold in the second quarter of  the liftlux product line and facility located in dillingen  germany  our scissor lift and boom lift product categories  and our us manlift product line 
year ended december  compared to consolidated net sales increased in to billion from billion in this increase in sales was due to the acquisition of grove on august  grove was included in our consolidated financial results for a full year in versus just under five months in consolidated net sales for were also impacted by a further downturn in the us crawler crane market that began in the decline in the domestic crawler crane market was partially offset in the crane segment by modest improvements in tower and mobile telescopic crane sales in parts of europe and asia 
consolidated net sales in were also negatively impacted in our marine segment from customer deferrals of new construction projects and a union strike in the first quarter 
in addition  our consolidated net sales were bolstered by the impact that the stronger euro had on the global consolidation of our us dollar denominated financial statements 
gross margin decreased in to from in this decline was due to reduced margins in our crane and marine segments  offset by a gross margin improvement in our foodservice segment 
crane segment gross margin declined percentage points during as a result of the following items i the loss of our ability to spread fixed costs over a comparable base of revenue due to the decline in production volumes in our domestic crawler crane business  ii a shift in product mix toward smaller mobile telescopic cranes  iii worldwide price competition in our crane segment  and iv lower historical margins for the grove product line 
foodservice segment gross margin increased percentage points during as the result of facility consolidations and operational improvements 
marine segment gross margin declined percentage points during due to the following i the change in mix of new construction project work toward projects in their earlier stages  ii customer deferrals of new project awards during the year  and iii the impact of the strike at marinette during the first quarter of the year 
the strengthening of the euro versus the us dollar in caused our manufacturing costs to increase at our european manufacturing facilities when converted to us dollars in our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  all of our segments experienced increased healthcare and insurance costs during versus es a increased during to of net sales versus of net sales in this percentage increase was due to lower sales volumes in the crane and marine segments  a larger volume of new project quotation activity within our marine segment  the impact of the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro in versus  and higher corporate expenses 
the increase in corporate expenses in is the result of growth due to recent acquisitions  corporate assumption of certain staff responsibilities previously handled by acquired companies and increases in health and insurance costs 
in addition  during  we invested in the development and introduction of new products within both our crane and foodservice segments 
our investment in new products resulted in increases in research and development spending as well as additional engineering costs 
during  the crane segment introduced new products  while the foodservice segment introduced new products 
offsetting these increases in es a costs  the total es a expenses were less in the foodservice and marine segments in than they were in by and  respectively 
all three of our segments took several actions to control and reduce certain es a expenses in and future years 
these actions included the continued consolidation of crane segment facilities in europe  closure of our national crane facility in waverly  nebraska  consolidating support functions and consolidations of certain of our beverage equipment distribution facilities 
amortization expense of million during increased over the million reported in this increase in amortization expense in was the result of a full year of amortization of patents acquired in the grove acquisition during the third quarter of and the increased us dollar translation of amortization expenses denominated in euros 
throughout  we completed certain restructuring activities primarily within our crane segment as a continuation of the grove acquisition in as well as other initiatives to reduce our overall fixed cost structure 
we recorded a total of million in restructuring costs during of this amount  million was the result of the write down of the values of certain properties in the us and europe that were made redundant as a result of our integration and reorganization activities 
our european crane operations also recognized million in restructuring costs associated with the closure of certain facilities and the relocation of inventory  equipment and people to other facilities 
we also recorded million in restructuring costs associated with the closure of our national crane production facility and the relocation of the production of our national boom truck product line 
in addition  our foodservice segment recorded million in restructuring costs associated with the closure of its ice machine production facility in italy to be relocated to china and the disposal of our multiplex facility in st 
louis  missouri 
during  we recognized a million curtailment gain as the result of certain amendments to our postretirement health benefit plan  which will reduce the amount of certain benefits participants will receive in future years 
after taking all of the above matters into account  our consolidated operating earnings from continuing operations for the year ended december  were million  which was lower than consolidated operating earnings in were of net sales compared to of net sales in interest expense during of million was higher than the million recorded during this increase in is due to a full year s worth of interest expense related to the senior subordinated notes due these notes were issued in august to complete the grove acquisition 
in addition  the increase in the euro versus us dollar exchange rate caused increased expense associated with our euro denominated senior subordinated notes due the weighted average interest rate paid on all outstanding debt at december  was as compared to at december  during  we paid down million of outstanding term debt due to strong cash flows 
only million of our debt payments were required during the year 
the remaining million of debt reduction in was prepayments 
during  we incurred million in costs resulting from these prepayments  of which million was due to the write off of deferred financing fees  and million was costs incurred to unwind certain interest rate swaps 
the effective income tax rate for continuing operations was  compared to in the decrease in our effective tax rate in was due to the impact of certain global tax planning initiatives as well as the impact of fixed permanent book tax differences on significantly lower pre tax income 
discontinued operations include the results of operations of femco  north central crane and our awp business and the costs associated with the sale or closure of these businesses 
in addition  discontinued operations include the cost associated with the final purchase price adjustment from the sale of manitowoc boom trucks in the awp business which was discontinued included our delta subsidiary  which was sold in the second quarter of  the liftlux product line and facility located in dillingen  germany  our scissor lift and boom lift product categories and our us manlift product line 
during  we recorded a million charge million net of tax related to the decision to exit these awp product categories and facilities and the sale of north central crane 
this total charge is made up of the following items i million for early termination of a facility lease contract  ii million for the write down of certain inventory to its estimated realizable value  iii million for employee severance  iv million for the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge in the awp reporting unit in the second quarter of  and v million for other asset impairment charges and estimated costs to close these operations 
sales and operating earnings by segment operating earnings reported below by segment include the impact of reductions due to restructurings and plant consolidation costs  and amortization expense whereas these expenses were separately identified in the results of consolidated operations table above 
cranes and related products prior year sales and operating earnings of the crane segment have been restated for the discontinued operations of awp  north central crane  manitowoc boom trucks  and femco 
net sales operating earnings operating margin year ended december  compared to net sales from the crane segment increased to billion versus million for the increased sales in was driven by increased volume of tower and mobile hydraulic cranes worldwide  increased crawler crane sales in asia  increases in our aftermarket sales and service business  and the impact of the euro exchange rate from year to year 
the impact of the euro exchange rate was of the increase in sales during  as compared to as of december   total crane segment backlog was million compared to million as of december  for  the crane segment reported net operating earnings of million compared to million for the crane segment recorded restructuring charges during and of million and million  respectively  which are included in operating earnings of the crane segment for each respective year 
operating earnings of the crane segment during was positively impacted by increased volume  the euro exchange rate and cost savings as a result of prior year integration actions 
operating earnings were negatively impacted by competitive pricing into emerging markets  and increased commodity prices 
increased commodity prices  primarily steel  negatively impacted crane segment operating earnings by million  net of pricing actions in versus year ended december  compared to net sales in the crane segment increased in compared to this increase was primarily due to our acquisition of grove on august  a full year of grove sales is included in the crane segment results for grove s net sales for the period from january  through august  were million compared to zero in prior to its acquisition 
crane segment net sales in were also impacted by the continued and further downturn in the us crawler crane market that began for us in this decline in the crawler crane market was partially offset by modest improvements in tower and mobile telescopic crane sales in parts of europe and asia 
in addition  the strengthening of the euro as compared to the us dollar during resulted in an increase in the us dollar equivalent for sales denominated in euro versus the prior year 
crane segment backlog stood at million at december   versus million at december  crane segment operating earnings decreased million in versus  which represents an operating margin decrease of percentage points 
a portion of the decrease is attributable to the inclusion of million in restructuring costs as a reduction of crane operating earnings in versus million in these costs included million for write down of certain properties to their net realizable value 
approximately million in restructuring costs related to the consolidation of our waverly  nebraska production into shady grove  and million for the completion of our restructuring activities associated with our potain workforce and facilities in europe 
crane segment operating earnings were also negatively impacted by the following i lower volumes in our domestic crawler crane business  ii a shift in product mix in the mobile telescopic product category to smaller capacity units  iii worldwide price competition across all product categories  and iv lower historical gross margins from the grove product line 
foodservice equipment segment net sales operating earnings operating margin year ended december  compared to foodservice segment net sales increased to million in compared to million in this increase was primarily the result of higher sales in our ice machine businesses 
the ice machine business performed well all year  outpacing the industry and posting the highest market share in our history 
sluggish demand in end markets  held net sales flat or down slightly in our beverage and refrigeration businesses for versus during  the foodservice segment introduced new products  which helped drive the aggregate segment sales increase 
operating earnings of million for were relatively flat with operating earnings of million for operating margins were down to for compared to for the reduction in operating margins and flat operating earnings was primarily due to increased prices for steel and other commodities  which added approximately million to our costs in compared to  net of pricing actions 
in addition  the foodservice segment incurred expenses of approximately million during related to the ongoing implementation of a segment wide erp system 
the company did not incur similar costs in the foodservice segment incurred approximately million and million of restructuring costs  which are included in operating earnings in and  respectively 
year ended december  compared to foodservice segment net sales decreased in compared to this decrease was the result of lower overall industry shipments in the segment s ice machine and beverage equipment businesses 
for the full year  industry shipments of ice machines were down approximately 
despite these industry trends  the segment s ice business reflected increased sales in compared to  increasing our market share 
beverage equipment sales in showed negative comparisons to due to a major chain new equipment rollout that occurred in the fourth quarter of that did not reoccur in our private label residential refrigerator division net sales in remained flat compared to new product introductions by our foodservice segment bolstered sales results with the introduction of new products  including the initial rollout of its new s series ice machine product during the fourth quarter of the year 
foodservice segment operating earnings increased in versus despite the slight decline in net sales 
the significant improvement in operating earnings was due to the strength of the ice machine business sales  facility consolidation  continued operational improvements across all of the divisions and lower restructuring costs in million compared to million 
the restructuring costs included million for closure of our italian ice machine production facility and movement of production to china 
the remaining restructuring costs were recorded as a result of the additional loss on final disposition of the segment s multiplex production facility located in st 
louis  missouri 
in summary  the operating earnings increase of far outpaced the net sales decline of due to favorable mix of sales  operational improvements and facility consolidation 
marine net sales operating earnings operating margin year ended december  compared to marine segment net sales increased to million in compared to million in the increase was a result of higher commercial contract revenue from construction contracts awarded to us during late and early in addition  sales for were adversely affected by the day strike at marinette marine corporation marinette 
also  we had greater repair work in the first quarter of compared to the first quarter of repair work is normally at higher margins than ne construction work 
between january and april of  we had one of the largest fleets in our history docked at our sturgeon bay shipyard 
during we completed our multi year contract for a fleet of seagoing buoy tenders for the us coast guard  and we delivered two staten island ferries for the city of new york  along with two double hull tank barges  and an ocean going tug for a commercial customer 
operating earnings of million in was a increase over operating earnings of million for similar to the crane and foodservice segments  the marine segment was impacted by higher steel costs 
increased steel costs decreased operating earnings by million in compared to in addition  during the marine segment incurred high start up costs for one of its commercial projects 
these costs were associated with a commercial vessel which we were building at our toledo shipyard 
bringing this project to toledo created significant inefficiencies we had not anticipated 
these setbacks not only created production cost issues  but also resulted in some late delivery costs 
during the fourth quarter of we expensed approximately million of additional costs associated with this project and moved the vessel to marinette  wisconsin for completion 
year ended december  compared to marine segment net sales decreased in versus this decrease was due in part to the impact of the day union strike at marinette in the first quarter of the strike slowed ship construction progress 
the impact of customer deferrals of awarding new construction contracts in the second half also contributed to the decrease 
in addition  several ships that were scheduled to dock at our facilities on the great lakes in the fourth quarter of were rescheduled for winter dry docking until the first quarter of as many of these boats remained active longer than expected 
operating earnings in the marine segment decreased million  or in compared to the reasons for this decline are the following i the change in mix of new construction project work toward newer projects and more commercial construction contracts  ii customer deferrals of new project awards during the year  iii the impact of the first quarter strike at marinette on project construction progress and efficiency  and iv additional costs incurred in on bidding for new project contracts 
these negative pressures on operating earnings were offset slightly by an increase in ship repair activities during compared to general corporate expenses net sales corporate expenses of net sales year ended december  compared to corporate expenses increased in versus  but were flat as a percentage of net sales 
the increase in corporate expenses in compared to is primarily the result of million in expense for a sales and use tax settlement incurred in the first quarter of and costs associated with our compliance activities relating to the sarbanes oxley act of year ended december  compared to corporate expenses increased in versus  but remained flat as a percentage of net sales at 
the reasons for the million increase year over year include additional personnel and related benefits resulting from our growth and the assumption of certain staff responsibilities previously handled by acquired companies  costs of compliance with new governmental regulations  certain reserves for litigation  and additional depreciation expense 
market conditions and outlook during a significant portion of our crane segment and consolidated net sales were from international markets 
while penetration in global markets is helpful to us  it also adds complexity and exposure to global risks and issues 
specifically  the issues of the strengthening euro versus the us dollar throughout and  and the impact of worldwide steel market activities on the costs of steel for our manufacturing processes  impacted us during the year and will continue to provide challenges and opportunities in certain markets are now available to us that were not available in past years  but continued unrest in iraq and the middle east in general has stymied significant immediate growth in that region 
during we saw signs of recovery in the us  and certain european and asian economies appear to be strengthening as well 
since signs appear to be favorable  we are cautiously optimistic about global economic recovery 
this optimism is tempered by continued concerns over rising commodity costs 
during  we will strive to protect our market shares  improve our cost structures  and continue to invest in new product development 
because of our efforts to become more global in our crane and foodservice businesses  we continue to be affected now more than ever by non domestic world economies 
the economies of europe and asia  in particular  affect our performance 
we believe that our diversified business model  global presence  and broad product offerings proved beneficial to us in and will continue to provide stability to our company into the future 
diversification within our segments also proved beneficial 
in our crane segment  stronger international performance  particularly in some parts of europe and asia  helped to lessen the continued impact of a weak north american crawler crane market 
cranes and related products we believe the crane market began a cyclical recovery in with the exception of the north american crawler crane market  most of our global markets were up in the market increase benefited most of our regional and product end markets 
material costs accelerated rapidly in  driven by steel and other raw materials 
product pricing increased during the year as the industry tried to pass along the material cost increases 
in general  the industry was not completely successful in passing on the cost increases  and gross margins declined as a result 
as we head into  however  we expect that the price increases will hold  material costs will stabilize  and the industry will continue to strive to raise prices or improved procurement efforts to further offset these cost increases 
during  we grew market share in most product segments in north america and europe 
in addition  we grew market share in many of our asian markets and made inroads in south america 
we are investing in infrastructure in asia so that we can continue to grow faster in that market place  and we recently announced that we are building a new crane manufacturing facility in china 
in  we introduced new products in the crane segment  which is the most that the crane segment has introduced in one year 
we will continue to invest in new products and product support in looking ahead  we expect volumes will increase modestly in north america in and remain flat or decline slightly in europe 
we expect that asia will continue to grow  driven by china expansion and general recovery of asian economies 
we believe that the construction equipment market has entered the growth phase of the cycle  which is typically several years in duration 
however  we have yet to see any signs of a pick up in the north american crawler crane market  which is an important market for our crane segment 
in addition  we expect to see a relatively strong euro through  as well as continued high costs of some commodities such as steel 
we have developed strategies to adapt to these conditions 
in this environment we plan to protect our market share by providing our customers with what we believe is the best value in the industry 
we will also work to grow our market share globally by leveraging the strength of our brand names  product service and support  and expanded product offerings 
in  we plan to introduce new crane models 
we will also continue to expand our global reach 
one way to achieve this expansion is through the strategic positioning of our sales and product support infrastructure in asia 
in addition  our global sales force is cross selling our entire product line 
our past acquisitions of potain and grove have given us a broad product offering and worldwide distribution and product support 
we believe these factors will help us continue to grow market share in we believe that our growth strategy is solid and supported by the diversification of our global manufacturing and distribution presence 
we will continue to attack our markets geographically  rather than by product line 
foodservice equipment in  the foodservice segment introduced more than new products for the third consecutive year 
these new product introductions led to a market share gain in ice machines and steady sales in our other product categories during a difficult equipment purchasing environment 
the industry got off to a strong start but weakened in the second half of the year 
it s difficult to determine whether this was a result of softening in consumer confidence  the cool and wet summer or pre election jitters  but we did see the recovery resume  post election 
the dramatic rise in commodity costs presented additional challenges for the group 
in most of our businesses  we were effective in passing price increases through the sales channel to partially offset the impact 
positive trends in year over year  same store sales in our customer segments  including the quick serve segment  were not consistent until later in the year  but we expect those trends in foodservice  lodging and convenience stores to continue into the recovery in the institution market is also picking up the pace 
with those positive industry indicators  experts are conservatively predicting a three to five percent growth in foodservice equipment and supply sales for we expect that the same factors that drove our strong operating performance in will continue to drive our business in as the market improves  we believe we are positioned to outperform the industry on the top line due to our wide range of new products that were introduced in and that continue to be rolled out in we also will continue to invest in foreign markets during in the third quarter we will complete construction of our new manufacturing and engineering center in hangzhou  china 
the increased presence will leverage our brand strength in the fastest growing foodservice equipment market in the world 
initially  we will manufacture ice machines and beverage equipment in this facility  but plan to expand manufacturing of other products for this region 
marine the marine segment had a challenging year in unlike prior years  where the book of business was scarce  the marine segment entered with a full backlog 
all three elements of revenue  including government new construction  commercial new construction and marine repair  were strong 
the segment s main challenge was to efficiently execute all of the work to be done 
entering  scheduled deliveries included two staten island ferries  the initial inls system  two wlb buoy tenders  three double hulled petroleum barges and one tug boat 
all deliveries were made with the exception of the inls system and one of the double hulled petroleum barges 
delivery of the inls system was pushed into the second quarter of due to a customer change order 
the one petroleum barge that did not make the scheduled delivery was being built at toledo 
that yard had not seen a new construction project in nearly years  and as discussed above was moved for completion to marinette  wisconsin 
even though the majority of scheduled deliveries were made  costs were much higher than anticipated  especially with the commercial new construction projects 
significant increases were seen in material  labor hours and labor rate 
material increases were driven by the sudden and sharp increase in steel  the impact of which was not able to be passed on to the customer 
labor hours went over budget on certain projects due to the tight schedule and high complexity of the projects 
the labor rate was driven up due to the shortage of local employees  which necessitated the use of higher rate  sub contracted laborers 
steps are being taken to ensure that future contracts do not experience these types of cost overruns 
the marked increase in new construction bid activity that was first seen in late is continuing into the segment was successful in landing a new commercial construction project for delivery of a self unloading cement barge in the second quarter of in deliveries  include one staten island ferry  inls system  one great lakes ice breaker and four double hulled petroleum barges 
in addition  the segment was awarded the prototype vessel of the navy s littoral combat ship lcs to be delivered in late our partners on this project include lockheed martin  gibbs cox and bollinger shipyards 
we are also one of the finalists in bidding for a vessel response boat medium rbm contract  which the us coast guard is expected to award in mid the improving us economy is helping buoy our shipbuilding business 
we are beginning to see more impact on ship construction demand due to the opa legislation  as all current us waterway oil hauling vessels have begun to be phased out  and must be replaced with double hull vessels by another positive sign is that charter rates are beginning to increase worldwide  which means additional revenue for commercial customers that can be used to build new vessels 
in addition  the markets for our traditional great lakes ship repair customers have picked up significantly 
nearly all the great lakes freighters are in service and are having difficulty keeping up with demand 
this means more dollars available for repairs that have been delayed from prior years 
based upon this activity  we anticipate increased repair revenue for the next several years 
our marine segment plans to continue to pursue new construction activities  provide superior repair and maintenance support to our customers  and work with other shipyards to provide integrated solutions to our mutual customers as the need arises 
acquisitions although we did not make any acquisitions in or  in the five years preceding we made several acquisitions  which resulted in significant growth of our company 
all of our acquisitions were recorded using the purchase method of accounting 
each of the acquisitions is included in our consolidated statement of operations beginning with the date of acquisition 
the success of our acquisition strategy is dependent upon our ability to successfully integrate the acquired businesses  operate them profitably  and accomplish our strategic objectives underlying the acquisition 
we attempt to address these challenges by adhering to a structured acquisition assessment and integration process and by employing appropriate internal resources and experienced personnel to assist us in accomplishing our objectives 
acquisitions on august  we acquired all of the outstanding common shares of grove 
the results of grove s operations have been included in the consolidated statements of operations since that date 
grove is a leading provider of mobile telescopic cranes  truck mounted cranes  boom trucks and aerial work platforms for the global market 
grove s products are used in a wide variety of applications by commercial and residential building contractors as well as by industrial  municipal  and military end users 
grove s products are marketed to independent equipment rental companies and directly to end users under the brand names grove crane  national crane  and grove manlift 
we view grove as a strategic fit with our crane business for a number of reasons 
grove is a global leader in the mobile telescopic crane industry  specifically in all terrain and rough terrain mobile telescopic cranes 
we did not offer these types of cranes prior to the acquisition  so grove filled this void in our product offering 
coupled with our entrance into the tower crane product line with the acquisition of potain sas in  grove enables us to offer customers four major crane categories  namely crawler cranes  tower cranes  mobile telescopic cranes and boom trucks 
with the addition of grove  we are able to offer customers equipment and lifting solutions for virtually every construction application 
we also believe that the combination of the two companies will provide opportunities to capitalize on their respective strengths in systems  technologies and manufacturing expertise  and that this combination will create natural synergies in its worldwide distribution and service network 
the aggregate purchase price paid for grove was million 
this includes the issuance of million of our common stock  the assumption of million of grove debt outstanding as of august   and direct acquisition costs of million 
in exchange for the outstanding shares of grove common stock  we issued approximately million shares of our common stock out of treasury with an average market price of per share 
the number of shares issued at the close of the transaction was calculated based on the average closing price of our common stock for the ten consecutive trading days ending on and including the second day prior to the closing of the transaction 
in addition  we assumed all of grove s outstanding liabilities approximately million including the outstanding debt  contingencies and commitments 
substantially all of the assumed debt was refinanced 
the purchase consideration paid in excess of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated first to the identifiable intangible assets with the remaining excess accounted for as goodwill 
we obtained valuations of identifiable intangible assets acquired 
based upon the valuations of identifiable intangible assets  the allocation was as follows million to trademarks and tradenames with an indefinite life  million to an in place distributor network with an indefinite life  million to patents with a weighted average year life  and the remaining million to goodwill 
the million of goodwill is included in the crane segment 
none of this amount is deductible for tax purposes 
we also obtained valuations of the fair value of inventory and property  plant and equipment acquired 
based upon the valuations of these assets  we increased the value of inventory and property  plant and equipment by million and million  respectively 
the million fair value adjustment to inventory was charged to cost of goods sold during the fourth quarter of as the related inventory items were sold 
the million fair value adjustment to property  plant and equipment is being depreciated over the estimated remaining useful lives of the property  plant and equipment 
during  we completed the purchase accounting related to the grove acquisition and we recorded million of purchase accounting adjustments to the august  grove opening balance sheet 
the purchase accounting adjustments related to the following million to finalize the accounting for deferred income taxes  related primarily to the grove non us operations  million for consolidation of the national crane facility located in nebraska to the grove facility located in pennsylvania  million  million and million for additional accounts receivable  inventory and warranty reserves  respectively  million related to severance and other employee related costs for headcount reductions at the grove facilities in europe  million of curtailment gain as a result of the closing of the national crane facility located in nebraska and its impact on pension obligations reduction of goodwill and million for other purchase accounting related items 
during  we also completed certain restructuring and integration activities relating to the grove acquisition 
the company recorded a charge totaling million related to these restructuring and integration activities during of this amount  million was recorded in the opening balance sheet of grove and million was recorded as a charge to earnings during the fourth quarter of the million recorded in the opening balance sheet related to severance and other employee related costs for headcount reductions at grove facilities 
on april   we purchased the remaining interest in our joint venture manitowoc foodservice europe f k a fabbrica apparecchiature per la praduzione del ghiaccio srl  a manufacturer of ice machines based in italy 
the aggregate cash consideration paid by us for the remaining interest was million and resulted in million of additional goodwill 
the million of goodwill is included in the foodservice segment and is not deductible for tax purposes 
during the second quarter of we recorded million of purchase accounting adjustments to the april  opening balance sheet 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operations during december  was million compared to million in this was applied to capital spending  dividends and payment of outstanding debt 
we had million in cash and short term investments along with million of unused availability under the terms of the revolving credit portion of our senior credit facility at december  the availability under the revolving credit portion of our senior credit facility is reduced for outstanding letters of credit of million as of december  during we built inventory to accommodate the large increase in backlog in the crane segment and increased our crane shipments to asia  which results in cranes remaining in inventory for a longer period of time due to shipment times 
in addition  inventory values were impacted by higher commodity costs 
offsetting the increase in inventory was a decrease in accounts receivable due to collection of receivables and an increase in payables and other liabilities  primarily due to the increase in inventory 
we spent a total of million during for capital expenditures 
we continue to fund capital expenditures to improve the cost structure of our business  to invest in new processes and technology  and to maintain high quality production standards 
the following table summarizes capital expenditures and depreciation by segment 
capital expenditures depreciation crane foodservice marine coporate total we received million of cash from the sale of delta during the second quarter of this cash is reported in the discontinued operations section of the cash flow from investing activities 
in december  we sold  pursuant to an underwritten public offering  approximately million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
net cash proceeds from this offering  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions  were million 
in addition to underwriting discounts and commissions  we incurred approximately million of additional accounting  legal and other expenses related to the offering that were charged to additional paid in capital 
we used a portion of the proceeds to redeem million of our senior subordinated notes due and to pay the required premium to the note holders of million 
we will use the balance for general corporate purposes 
the redemption of the senior subordinated notes due was completed on january  during  we sold million of our long term notes receivable to third party financing companies 
we have agreed to provide recourse on the notes to the financing company 
we have accounted for the sale of the notes as a financing of receivables 
during  million of these notes has been collected by the third party financing companies 
our debt at december   consisted primarily of our senior notes due  our senior subordinated notes due  and our senior subordinated notes due  as well as outstanding amounts under foreign overdraft facilities 
the senior credit facility is comprised of million term loan a  a million term loan b  and million revolving credit facility 
during the third quarter of  we prepaid the outstanding principal balance of the term loan b portion of our senior credit facility totaling million 
as of december   we have no amount outstanding under the term loan a  term loan b or revolving credit portions of our senior credit facility 
the term loan a portion of our senior credit facility was prepaid in full during the fourth quarter of substantially all of our domestic tangible and intangible assets are pledged as collateral under the senior credit facility 
borrowings under the senior credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to the sum of a base rate or a eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin  which is based on our consolidated total leverage ratio  as defined in the senior credit facility 
the annual commitment fee in effect on the unused portion of our revolving credit facility at december  was 
on november   we completed the sale of million of senior notes due senior notes due 
the senior notes due are unsecured senior obligations ranking prior to our million euro of senior subordinated notes due senior subordinated notes due million based on december  exchange rates and prior to our million of senior subordinated notes due senior subordinated notes due 
our secured senior indebtedness under our senior credit facility ranks equally with the senior notes due  except that it is secured by substantially all domestic tangible and intangible assets of the company and its subsidiaries 
interest on the senior notes due is payable semiannually in may and november each year 
the senior notes due can be redeemed by us in whole or in part for a premium on or after november  in addition  we may redeem for a premium at any time prior to november   up to of the face amount of the senior notes due with the proceeds of one or more equity offerings 
we used the net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes due for prepayment of our term loan a and partial prepayment of our term loan b under our senior credit facility 
we had outstanding at december   million euro million based on december  exchange rates of senior subordinated notes due the senior subordinated notes due are unsecured obligations ranking subordinate in right of payment to all of our senior debt other than our senior subordinated notes due  are equal in rank to our senior subordinated notes due  and are fully and unconditionally  jointly and severally guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries 
interest on these senior subordinated notes due is payable semiannually in may and november of each year 
these notes can be redeemed by us in whole or in part for a premium after may  we also had outstanding at december   million of senior subordinated notes due the senior subordinated notes due are unsecured obligations of the company ranking subordinate in right of payment to all of our senior debt other than our senior subordinated notes due  are equal in rank to our senior subordinated notes due  and are fully and unconditionally  jointly and severally guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries 
interest on the senior subordinated notes due is payable semiannually in february and august each year 
these notes can be redeemed by us in whole or in part for a premium on or after august  in addition  we may redeem for a premium  at any time prior to august   up to of the face amount of these senior subordinated notes due with the proceeds of one or more equity offerings 
our senior credit facility  senior notes due  and senior subordinated notes due and contain customary affirmative and negative covenants 
in general  the covenants contained in the senior credit facility are more restrictive than those of the senior notes due and the senior subordinated notes due and among other restrictions  these covenants require us to meet specified financial tests  which include the following consolidated interest coverage ratio  consolidated total leverage ratio  consolidated senior leverage ratio  and fixed charge coverage 
these covenants also limit our ability to redeem or repurchase our debt  incur additional debt  make acquisitions  merge with other entities  pay dividends or distributions  repurchase capital stock  lend money or make advances  create or become subject to liens  and make capital expenditures 
the senior credit facility also contains cross default provisions whereby certain defaults under any other debt agreements would result in default under the senior credit facility 
we were in compliance with all covenants as of december   and based upon our current plans and outlook  we believe we will be able to comply with these covenants during the remaining life of the facility 
our debt position increases our vulnerability to general adverse industry and economic conditions and results in a significant portion of our cash flow from operations being used for payment of interest on our debt 
this could potentially limit our ability to respond to market conditions or take advantage of future business opportunities 
our ability to service our debt is dependent upon many factors  some of which are not subject to our control  such as general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  and regulatory factors 
in addition  our ability to borrow additional funds under the senior credit facility in the future will depend on our meeting the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement  even after taking into account such new borrowings 
the senior credit facility or other future facilities may be used for funding future acquisitions  seasonal working capital requirements  capital expenditures  and other investing and financing needs 
we believe that our available cash  credit facility  cash generated from future operations  and access to debt and equity markets will be adequate to fund our capital and debt financing requirements for the foreseeable future 
management also considers the following regarding liquidity and capital resources to identify trends  demands  commitments  events and uncertainties that require disclosure a 
our senior credit facility requires us to comply with certain financial ratios and tests to comply with the terms of the agreement 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december   the latest measurement date 
the occurrence of any default of these covenants could result in acceleration of our obligations under the senior credit facility and foreclosure on the collateral related to such obligations 
further  such acceleration would constitute an event of default under the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes due and and our senior notes due b 
circumstances that could impair our ability to continue to engage in transactions that have been integral to historical operations or are financially or operationally essential  or that could render that activity commercially impracticable  such as the inability to maintain a specified credit rating  level of earnings  earnings per share  financial ratios  or collateral 
we do not believe that the risk factors applicable to our business are reasonably likely to impair our ability to continue to engage in our historical operations at this time 
c 
factors specific to us and our markets that we expect to be given significant weight in the determination of our credit rating or will otherwise affect our ability to raise short term and long term financing 
we do not presently believe that the risk factors applicable to our business are reasonably likely to materially affect our credit ratings or would otherwise adversely affect our ability to raise short term or long term financing 
d 
we do not have any significant guarantees of debt or other commitments to third parties 
we have disclosed information related to guarantees in note to our consolidated financial statements 
e 
written options on non financial assets for example  real estate puts 
we do not have any written options on non financial assets 
off balance sheet arrangements our disclosures concerning transactions  arrangements and other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources are as follows we have disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements our buyback and residual value guarantee commitments 
we also lease various assets under operating leases 
the future estimated payments under these arrangements are also disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have disclosed our accounts receivable factoring arrangement with a bank in note to the consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments a summary of our significant contractual obligations as of december  is as follows total committed thereafter long term debt capital leases operating leases purchase obligations total committed there were no significant purchase obligation commitments at december  additionally  at december   we had outstanding letters of credit that totaled million 
we also had buyback commitments and residual value guarantees outstanding  that if all were satisfied at december   the total cash cost to us would be million  this amount is not reduced for amounts the company may recover from repossessing and subsequent resale of the collateral 
we maintain defined benefit pension plans for some of our operations in the united states and europe 
it is our policy to fund the pension plans at the minimum level required by applicable regulations 
in  cash contributions to the pension plans by us were million  and we estimate that our pension plan contributions will be approximately million in risk management we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates  commodities  and changes in foreign currency exchange 
to reduce these risks  we selectively use financial instruments and other proactive management techniques 
we have written policies and procedures that place financial instruments under the direction of corporate treasury and restrict all derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes 
the use of financial instruments for trading purposes or speculation is strictly prohibited 
for a more detailed discussion of our accounting policies and the financial instruments that we use  please refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  debt  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk in we used interest rate swaps such that approximately of our debt is fixed and is floating 
at december   we had five fixed to floating interest rate swaps with financial institutions 
these swap contracts effectively convert million of our fixed rate senior subordinated and senior notes to variable rate debt 
under these swap agreements  we contract with a counter party to exchange the difference between a floating rate and the fixed rate applied to million of our senior subordinated notes and senior notes 
these contracts are considered to be a hedge against changes in the fair value of the fixed rate obligations 
accordingly  these interest rate swap contracts are reflected at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet at december  as an asset of million and the related debt is reflected at an amount equal to the sum of its carrying value plus an adjustment representing the change in fair value of the debt obligation attributable to the interest rate risk being hedged 
changes during any accounting period in the fair value of the interest rate swap contract  as well as the offsetting changes in the adjusted carrying value of the related portion of fixed rate debt being hedged  are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense in the consolidated statement of earnings 
the change in the fair value of the swaps exactly offsets the change in fair value of the hedged fixed rate debt  therefore  there was no net impact on earnings from these swaps for the year ended december  a increase or decrease in the floating rate we pay under these swap agreements would result in a change in pre tax interest expense of approximately million 
this amount was calculated assuming the year end weighted average rate of the swaps was constant throughout the year 
as a result of prepayments made during of the term loan b portion of our senior credit facility we unwound our entire floating to fixed interest rate swap 
as a result  we recorded a charge of million in the consolidated statement of earnings as a component of early extinguishment of debt 
interest swaps expose us to the risk that the counter party may be unable to pay amounts it owes us under the swap agreements 
to manage this risk we enter into swap agreements only with financial institutions that have high credit ratings 
commodity prices we are exposed to fluctuating market prices for commodities  including steel  copper  foam  and aluminum 
each of our business segments is subject to the effect of changing raw material costs caused by movements in underlying commodity prices 
we have established programs to manage the negotiations of commodity prices 
some of these programs are centralized within business segments  and others are specific to a business unit 
in  certain of these commodities were subject to abnormal availability and significant price increases 
during  gross profit was negatively impacted as a result of commodity price increases in the crane  foodservice and marine segments by million  million and million  respectively  compared to in all cases  the impact of commodity price increases on gross profit is net of price increases to our customers and adjustments to our material standards 
although we have established procedures in place to manage these pressures in  we can provide no assurance that these measures will insulate us fully from adverse consequences of continued unfavorable developments in the commodity markets 
currency risk we have manufacturing  sales and distribution facilities around the world and thus make investments and enter into transactions denominated in various foreign currencies 
international sales  including those sales that originated outside of the united states  were approximately of our total sales for  with the largest percentage being sales into various european countries 
regarding transactional foreign exchange risk  we enter into limited forward exchange contracts to reduce earnings and cash flow impact on nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables  predominantly between our euro denominated operations and their customers outside the euro zone 
gains and losses resulting from hedging instruments offset the foreign exchange gains and losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged 
the maturities of these forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement date of the related transactions 
we also periodically hedge anticipated transactions  primarily at firm order date for orders to be sold into non euro denominated locations  with forward exchange contracts 
these forward exchange contracts are designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
at december   we had outstanding million of forward exchange contracts hedging underlying accounts receivable and million of forward exchange contracts hedging outstanding firm orders 
a appreciation or depreciation of the underlying functional currency at december   would not have a significant impact on our consolidated statement of earnings as any gains or losses under the foreign exchange contracts hedging accounts receivable balances would be offset by equal gains or losses on the underlying receivables 
any gains or losses under the foreign exchange contracts hedging outstanding firm orders would not have a significant impact due to the relatively immaterial amount of contracts outstanding being hedged 
continued strength in the euro versus the us dollar in will require us to manage the transactional exchange risk through continued use of foreign currency hedging 
in addition  relative currency values will impact our strategic and operational activities 
our primary translation exchange risk exposure at december  was with the euro 
to a much lesser extent  we are also exposed to translation risk with our other foreign operations  primarily in the united kingdom 
our euro denominated million senior subordinated notes due offsets a significant amount of the translation risk with our operating movement in europe 
the currency effects of this foreign denominated debt obligation are reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss account within stockholders equity  where it offsets the translation impact of an equal amount of similarly foreign denominated net assets of our european operations 
a appreciation or depreciation of the value of the euro to the us dollar at december  would have an impact of increasing or decreasing the outstanding debt balance on our consolidated balance sheet by million 
this impact would be partially offset by gains and losses on our net investments in foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the euro 
at december   there was also a portion of our foreign currency translation exposure that was not hedged 
amounts invested in non us based subsidiaries are translated into us dollar at the exchange rate in effect at year end 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders equity as cumulative translation adjustments 
the translation adjustment recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income at december   is million  or approximately of total stockholders equity 
using year end exchange rates  the total amount invested in foreign operations at december  was approximately million of which million was naturally hedged with local  non us dollar debt 
environmental  health  safety  and other matters our global operations are governed by laws addressing the protection of the environment  and employee safety and health 
under various circumstances  these laws impose civil and criminal penalties and fines  as well as injunctive and remedial relief  for noncompliance 
they also may require remediation at sites where company related substances have been released into the environment 
we have expended substantial resources globally  both financial and managerial  to comply with the applicable laws and regulations  and to protect the environment and our workers 
we believe we are in substantial compliance with such laws and regulations and we maintain procedures designed to foster and ensure compliance 
however  we have been and may in the future be subject to formal or informal enforcement actions or proceedings regarding noncompliance with such laws or regulations  whether or not determined to be ultimately responsible in the normal course of business 
historically  these actions have been resolved in various ways with the regulatory authorities without material commitments or penalties to the company 
we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cerla in connection with the lemberger landfill superfund site near manitowoc  wisconsin 
eleven of the approximately potentially responsible parties  including us  have formed the lemberger site remediation group and have successfully negotiated with the united states environmental protection agency and the wisconsin department of natural resources to fund the cleanup and settle our potential liability at this site 
estimates indicate that the total costs to clean up this site are approximately million 
however  the ultimate allocations of costs for this site are not yet final 
although liability is joint and several  our share of the liability is estimated to be of the total cost 
prior to december   we accrued million in connection with this matter 
the amounts we have spent each year through december  to comply with our portion of the cleanup costs have not been material 
remediation work at the site has been substantially completed  with only long term pumping and treating of groundwater and site maintenance remaining 
our remaining estimated liability for this matter  included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at december  is million 
based on the size of our current allocation of liabilities at this site  the existence of other viable potential responsible parties and current reserve  we do not believe that any additional liability imposed in connection with this site will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
at certain of our other facilities  we have identified potential contaminants in soil and groundwater 
the ultimate cost of any remediation required will depend upon the results of future investigation 
based upon available information  we do not expect that the ultimate costs will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
we believe that we have obtained and are in substantial compliance with those material environmental permits and approvals necessary to conduct our various businesses 
based on the facts presently known  we do not expect environmental compliance costs to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
as of december   various product related lawsuits were pending 
to the extent permitted under applicable law  all of these are insured with self insurance retention levels 
our self insurance retention levels vary by business  and have fluctuated over the last five years 
the range of our self insured retention levels are million to million per occurrence 
the high end of our self insurance retention level is a legacy product liability insurance program inherited with the acquisition of grove in for cranes manufactured in the united states for occurrences from through october as of december   the largest self insured retention level currently maintained by us for current year occurrences is million per occurrence and applies to product liability claims for cranes manufactured in the united states 
product liability reserves in the consolidated balance sheet at december   were million  million reserved specifically for cases and million for claims incurred but not reported which were estimated using actuarial methods 
based on our experience in defending product liability claims  we believe the current reserves are adequate for resolution of aggregate self insured claims and insured claims incurred as of december  any recoveries from insurance carriers are dependent upon the legal sufficiency of claims and solvency of insurance carriers 
at december  and  we had reserved million and million  respectively  for warranty claims included in product warranties and other non current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
certain of these warranties and other related claims involve matters in dispute that ultimately are resolved by negotiations  arbitration  or litigation 
it is reasonably possible that the estimates for environmental remediation  product liability and warranty costs may change in the near future based upon new information that may arise or matters that are beyond the scope of our historical experience 
presently  there are no reliable methods to estimate the amount of any such potential changes 
we are involved in numerous lawsuits involving asbestos related claims in which we are one of numerous defendants 
after taking into consideration legal counsel s evaluation of such actions  the current political environment with respect to asbestos related claims  and the liabilities accrued with respect to such matters  in the opinion of management  ultimate resolution is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
we are also involved in various legal actions arising out of the normal course of business 
taking into account the liabilities accrued and legal counsel s evaluation of such actions  in the opinion of management the ultimate resolution of these actions is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
currently  we are in negotiations with one of our major marine customers due to cost overruns from change orders on a contract 
we estimate our overruns could affect profitability by approximately million 
we have assumed this recovery in accounting for this long term contract  as we believe that the claim will result in additional contract revenue and the amount can be reliably estimated 
if negotiations are unsuccessful  the impact on our consolidated statement of operations in a future period could be material 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all its subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these consolidated financial statements  we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involve the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
although we have listed a number of accounting policies below which we believe to be most critical  we also believe that all of our accounting policies are important to the reader 
therefore  please refer also to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed description of these and other accounting policies of the company 
revenue recognition revenue is generally recognized and earned when all the following criteria are satisfied with regard to a specific transaction persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  collectibility of cash is reasonably assured  and delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
we periodically enter into transactions with customers that provide for residual value guarantees and buyback commitments 
these transactions are recorded as operating leases for all significant residual value guarantees and for all buyback commitments 
these initial transactions are recorded as deferred revenue and are amortized to income on a straight line basis over a period equal to that of the customer s third party financing agreement 
in addition  we lease cranes to customers under operating lease terms 
proceeds received in connection with these transactions are recognized as revenue over the term of the lease  and leased cranes are depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
revenue recognition under percentage of completion accounting revenue under long term contracts within the marine segment are recognized using the percentage of completion poc method of accounting 
under this method  sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at the completion of the contract 
recognized revenues that will not be billed under the terms of the contract until a later date are recorded as recoverable costs and accrued profit on progress completed not billed  which are included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
likewise  contracts where billings to date have exceeded recognized revenues are recorded as amounts billed in excess of sales  which are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet 
changes to the original estimates may be required during the life of the contract and such estimates are reviewed when customer change orders are placed and on a regular periodic basis 
sales and gross profit are adjusted when known for revisions in estimated total contract costs and contract values 
claims against customers are recognized as revenue when it is probable that the claim will result in additional contract revenue and the amount can be reliably estimated 
estimated losses are recorded when identified 
the use of the poc method of accounting involves considerable use of estimates in determining revenues  costs and profits and in assigning the amounts to accounting periods 
the company continually evaluates all of the issues related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the poc method of accounting 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
our estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables includes evaluation of specific accounts where we have information that the customer my have an inability to meet its financial obligations together with a general provision for unknown but existing doubtful accounts based on pre established percentages to specific aging categories which are subject to change if experience improves or deteriorates 
inventories and related reserve for obsolete and excess inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using both the first in  first out fifo method and the last in  first out lifo method and are reduced by a reserve for excess and obsolete inventories 
the estimated reserve is based upon pre established percentages applied to specific aging categories of inventory 
these categories are evaluated based upon historical usage  estimated future usage  and sales requiring the inventory 
these percentages were established based upon historical write off experience 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for goodwill and other intangible assets under the guidance of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized  however  it is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the company performs impairment reviews for its reporting units  which have been determined to be cranes americas  cranes europe  middle east  and africa  cranes asia  ice group  refrigeration group  beverage group  and marine group  using a fair value method based on the present value of future cash flows  which involves management s judgments and assumptions 
the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit  including recorded goodwill 
the company is subject to financial statement risk to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value 
the impairment testing performed by the company at june   indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its corresponding carrying amount  including recorded goodwill and  as such  no impairment existed at that time 
other intangible assets with definite lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
indefinite and definite lived intangible assets are also subject to impairment testing 
a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests  principally in determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
while the company believes its judgments and assumptions were reasonable  different assumptions could change the estimated fair values and  therefore  impairment charges could be required 
employee benefit plans we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees  including pensions and postretirement health care 
plan assets and obligations are recorded annually based on the company s measurement date utilizing various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates  expected return on plan assets  compensation increases  retirement and mortality rates  and health care cost trend rates as of that date 
the approach we use to determine the annual assumptions are as follows discount rate our discount rate assumptions are based on the interest rate of noncallable high quality corporate bonds  with appropriate consideration of our pension plans participants demographics and benefit payment terms 
expected return on plan assets our expected return on plan assets assumptions are based on our expectation of the long term average rate of return on assets in the pension funds  which is reflective of the current and projected asset mix of the funds and considers the historical returns earned on the funds 
compensation increase our compensation increase assumptions reflect our long term actual experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
retirement and mortality rates our retirement and mortality rate assumptions are based primarily on actual plan experience 
health care cost trend rates our health care cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
measurements of net periodic benefit cost are based on the assumptions used for the previous year end measurements of assets and obligations 
the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions when appropriate 
as required by us gaap  the effects of the modifications are recorded currently or amortized over future periods 
based on information provided by its independent actuaries and other relevant sources  we believe that our assumptions used are reasonable  however  changes in these assumptions could impact the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
product liability we are subject in the normal course of business to product liability lawsuits 
to the extent permitted under applicable laws  our exposure to losses from these lawsuits is mitigated by insurance with self insurance retention limits 
we record product liability reserves for our self insured portion of any pending or threatened product liability actions 
our reserve is based upon two estimates 
first  we track the population of all outstanding pending and threatened product liability cases to determine an appropriate case reserve for each based upon our best judgment and the advice of legal counsel 
these estimates are continually evaluated and adjusted based upon changes to the facts and circumstances surrounding the case 
second  we obtain a third party actuarial analysis to determine the amount of additional reserve required to cover incurred but not reported product liability issues and to account for possible adverse development of the established case reserve collectively referred to as ibnr 
this actuarial analysis is performed at least twice annually and our ibnr reserve for product liability is adjusted based upon the results of these analysis 
we have established a position within the actuarially determined range  which we believe is the best estimate of the ibnr liability 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we record a valuation allowance that represents foreign operating loss carryforwards for which utilization is uncertain 
management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance would need to be adjusted in the event future taxable income is materially different than amounts estimated 
our policy is to remit earnings from foreign subsidiaries only to the extent any resultant foreign taxes are creditable in the united states 
accordingly  we do not currently provide for additional united states and foreign income taxes which would become payable upon remission of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
stock options we account for our stock option plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
no stock option based employee compensation costs are reflected in earnings  as all option grants under the plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
warranties in the normal course of business we provide our customers a warranty covering workmanship  and in some cases materials  on products manufactured by us 
such warranty generally provides that products will be free from defects for periods ranging from months to months 
if a product fails to comply with our warranty  we may be obligated  at our expense to correct any defect by repairing or replacing such defective product 
we provide for an estimate of costs that may be incurred under our warranty at the time product revenue is recognized based on historical warranty experience for the related product or estimates of projected losses due to specific warranty issues on new products 
these costs primarily include labor and materials  as necessary associated with repair or replacement 
the primary factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of shipped units and historical and anticipated rates or warranty claims 
as these factors are impacted by actual experience and future expectations  we assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability and adjust the amounts as necessary 
restructuring charges restructuring charges for exit and disposal activities are recognized when the liability is incurred 
we use the definition of liability found in fasb concept statement no 
 elements of financial statements 
in addition  the liability for the restructuring charge associated with an exit or disposal activity is measured initially at its fair value
