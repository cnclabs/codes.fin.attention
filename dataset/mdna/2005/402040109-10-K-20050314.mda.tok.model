item selected financial data the selected data presented below under the captions income statement data and balance sheet and other data for  and as of the end of  each of the years in the five year periods ended december   are derived from the consolidated financial statements of guitar center  inc and subsidiaries  which financial statements have been audited by kpmg llp  independent registered public accounting firm 
the consolidated financial statements as of december  and  and for each of the years in the three year period ended december   and the report thereon  are included elsewhere in this annual report

for the year ended december   the million weighted average shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the senior convertible notes were deemed to be potential common stock and are included in the calculation of earnings per share from the period of june   the issuance date of the notes  to december   under the if converted method 
the diluted earnings per share for has been restated to conform to eitf  accounting issues related to certain features of contingently convertible debt and the effect on diluted earnings per share 
net sales per gross square foot is a measure of sales efficiency based on square footage 
this calculation is presented for guitar center retail stores only  excluding american music retail stores  and does not include new stores opened during the reporting period 
compares net sales for the comparable periods  excluding net sales attributable to stores not open for months as of the end of the latter reporting period 
all references in this annual report to comparable store sales results are based on this calculation methodology 
for the purpose of calculating the ratio of earnings to fixed charges  earnings represents income before provision for income taxes and fixed charges 
fixed charges consist of interest expense  amortization of debt financing costs  and one third of lease expense  which management believes is representative of the interest components of lease expense 
represents net income before interest expense  income taxes  and depreciation and amortization expense 
the reconciliation from reported net income to ebitda is as follows ebitda net income as reported income taxes interest expense depreciation and amortization ebitda ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles 
we present ebitda because many investors view this information as a useful measure of a company s ability to generate cash flow and service debt or capital obligations  and some of our debt instruments have in the past and may in the future include covenants that use similar concepts 
ebitda should not  however  be considered as a substitute for measures determined under generally accepted accounting principles  such as net income and cash flow from operations 
further  the calculation of ebitda varies from company to company and thus the amount that we calculated using the methodology described above may not be comparable to the amount of ebitda reported by other companies 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general guitar center is the nation s leading retailer of guitars  amplifiers  percussion instruments  keyboards and live sound dj and recording equipment based on annual revenue 
as of december   we operated guitar center stores  with stores in major markets and stores in secondary markets 
in addition  our american music division operates stores specializing in band and orchestral instruments for sale and rental  serving teachers  band directors  college professors and students 
we are also the largest direct response retailer of musical instruments in the united states through our wholly owned subsidiary  musician s friend  inc  and its catalog and web site  www 
musiciansfriend 
com 
during  we opened new stores and relocated one store which resulted in the addition of approximately  square feet of store space 
the new store opening program for included nine small format guitar center stores and five large format stores 
in the five year period from the beginning of to the end of  we have grown from guitar center stores to guitar center stores  consisting of large flagship stores in hollywood  manhattan  nashville and san francisco  other large format stores and small format stores 
total square footage grew from  square feet at the beginning of to  square feet at the end of as we enter new markets  we expect that we will initially incur higher administrative and promotional costs per store than is currently experienced in established markets 
we expect competition to continue to increase as other music product retailers attempt to execute national growth strategies 
our business strategy will also emphasize opportunities to continue to grow each of our brands  including further acquisitions if attractive candidates can be located for reasonable prices 
from to  our net sales grew at an annual compound growth rate of  principally due to the comparable store sales growth of our retail stores averaging per year  the opening of new stores  and a per year increase in the direct response channel 
we believe such volume increases are the result of the continued success of the implementation of our business strategy  continued growth in the music products industry and increasing consumer awareness of the guitar center  musician s friend and american music brand names 
we achieved comparable store sales growth of   and for the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively 
we believe this growth reflects the strength of our merchandise selection  effective advertising and promotion  and well trained and committed personnel 
executive summary consolidated net sales in increased to billion from billion in consolidated net income in increased to million or per diluted share  from million  or per diluted share  in during  our guitar center stores generated comparative store sales growth and an increase in total net sales 
sales from new stores contributed million and accounted for of the sales increase in our guitar center stores 
late in the year we increased our advertising expenditure  predominately focused on generating a greater number of impressions through our mailing list  which resulted in higher traffic in our stores 
our direct response division generated a increase in net sales 
for the year  we achieved an initial order fill rate of compared to in our return rate as a percentage of sales was in compared to in the improvements that were made to the musician s friend web site over the last year  as well as to the infrastructure and systems at the direct response call center and fulfillment center  permitted us to capitalize on high demand 
we continue to encounter operational challenges in our american music stores 
the results of american music also continue to reflect investments in the systems and infrastructure for the stores 
despite the challenges we are experiencing in this business  we generated an increase of in net sales and achieved comparable store sales for the year 
we are repositioning our american music stores and establishing scalable infrastructure and systems for this area of our business 
the american music stores incurred operating losses in failure to execute on the requirements and initiatives described above could potentially require us to recognize an impairment in the significant amount of goodwill recorded in the acquisitions of american music  m m music and karnes music  which totaled million at december  no such impairment has been recorded through december  on february   two of our subsidiaries entered into an agreement and plan of merger pursuant to which it is contemplated that music arts center  inc mac will become a wholly owned subsidiary of our subsidiary guitar center stores  inc mac is a privately held musical instruments retailer based in maryland which primarily addresses the beginning musician  with an emphasis on rentals  music lessons and band and orchestra instrument sales 
mac s operations include approximately retail locations and seven educational support centers 
the purchase price for the stock of mac is million  subject to adjustment for the actual level at closing of working capital and a term note of mac due to its bank  and seller transaction expenses 
in addition  we are assuming designated debt and other deferred obligations  presently estimated at approximately million 
the purchase consideration for the stock of mac is all cash  with million to be held in an escrow account for months as partial security for the stockholders indemnification obligations in the event of a breach of a representation  warranty  covenant or agreement contained in the merger agreement or any related instrument 
we intend to fund the acquisition from available cash and drawings under our credit facility 
discussion of critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
additionally  the policy described below regarding credits and other vendor allowances is unique to our industry and deserves the attention of a reader of our financial statements 
valuation of inventory we value our inventories at the lower of cost using the first in  first out fifo method or market 
rental inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the specific identification method and are depreciated on a straight line basis while out under a rental agreement for rent to own sales 
we record adjustments to the value of inventory based upon obsolescence and changes in market value 
applicable costs associated with bringing inventory through our guitar center retail distribution center are capitalized to inventory 
the amounts are expensed to cost of goods sold as the associated inventory is sold 
management has evaluated the current level of inventories considering future customer demand for our products  taking into account general economic conditions  growth prospects within the marketplace  competition  market acceptance of current and upcoming products  and management initiatives 
based on this evaluation  we have recorded impairment adjustments to cost of goods sold for estimated decreases in net realizable value 
these judgments are made in the context of our customers shifting needs  product and technological trends  and changes in the demographic mix of our customers 
a misinterpretation or misunderstanding of these conditions and uncertainties in the future outlook of our industry or the economy  or other failure to estimate correctly  could result in inventory valuation changes as of any given balance sheet date 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets such as property and equipment and identifiable intangibles with definite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
goodwill and intangibles that are not amortized is required to be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently when triggering events occur 
factors we consider important  which could trigger impairment  include  among other things significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant decline in stock value for a sustained period 
for long lived assets other than goodwill and intangibles that are not amortized  the determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets  as compared to the carrying value of the assets 
assumptions used in these cash flows are consistent with internal forecasts and consider current and future expected sales volumes and related operating costs and any anticipated increases or declines based on expected market conditions and local business environment factors 
if a potential impairment is identified  the amount of the impairment loss recognized would be determined by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss if the fair value was less than the book value 
fair value will be determined based on appraisal values assessed by third parties  if deemed necessary  or a discounted future cash flows analysis 
for goodwill and other intangibles that are not amortized  impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the related assets of the underlying reporting unit to which the goodwill relates 
our assessment regarding the existence of impairment factors is based on market conditions and the operational performance of our business 
our review of factors present and the resulting appropriate carrying value of our goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets are subject to judgments and estimates that management is required to make 
sales returns as part of our satisfaction guaranteed policy  we allow guitar center customers to return product generally within days after the date of purchase  and we allow musician s friend customers to return product within days 
american music customers have ten business days from the date of purchase to return product 
we regularly review and revise  when deemed necessary  our estimates of sales returns based upon historical trends 
while our estimates during the past few years have approximated actual results  actual returns may differ significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from estimates if factors such as economic conditions or the competitive environment differ from our expectations 
credits and other vendor allowances we receive cooperative advertising allowances ie  an allowance from the manufacturer to subsidize qualifying advertising and similar promotional expenditures we make relating to the vendor s products  price protection credits ie  credits from vendors with respect to in stock inventory if the vendor subsequently lowers their wholesale price for such products and vendor rebates ie  credits or rebates provided by vendors based on the purchase of specified products and paid at a later date 
cooperative advertising allowances are recognized as a reduction to selling  general  and administrative expense when we incur the advertising expense eligible for the credit 
we recognized cooperative advertising allowances of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  recorded as an offset to selling  general and administrative expense 
price protection credits and vendor rebates are accounted for as a reduction of the cost of merchandise inventory and are recorded at the time the credit or rebate is earned 
the effect of price protection credits and vendor rebates is recognized in the income statement at the time the related inventory is sold  as a reduction in cost of goods sold 
we regularly review and revise  when deemed necessary  our estimates of rebates reserve based upon historical trends 
we received payments of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we earned vendor rebates of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
none of these credits are recorded as revenue 
results of operations the following table presents our consolidated statements of income  as a percentage of sales  for the periods indicated fiscal year ended december  net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense  net income before income taxes income taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for the year ended december  increased to billion  compared with billion last year 
net sales from guitar center stores for fiscal totaled billion  an increase from million in fiscal sales from new stores contributed million and represented of the total increase in retail store sales 
comparable guitar center store sales for the full year increased 
comparable store sales are defined as sales for the comparable periods  excluding net sales attributable to stores not open for months as of the end of the reporting period 
we believe that comparable store sales are a more useful indicator of store performance than the change in total net sales  since comparable store sales exclude the effects of changes in the number of stores open 
the increase in comparable store sales was due to positive response to our advertising and marketing strategy for our guitar center stores 
total advertising and marketing expense increased from million to million in our management is presently anticipating comparable guitar center store sales growth of to for the first quarter in please see forward looking statements  business risks  below

gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the guitar center stores was compared with for the year ended december  and the increase is due to higher selling margin  leveraged occupancy costs due to the strong comparable store sales increase  and lower inventory shrink

the cost of merchandise inventory is net of all associated vendor discounts and rebates

during the fourth quarter  the direct response division changed its revenue recognition methodology  whereby we do not recognize revenue until the estimated date an order is received by the customer  instead of the date shipped 
this change resulted in a reduction of approximately million in net sales  and of approximately  in net income  or per diluted share  for the fourth quarter 
the impact of this change was immaterial to the prior quarters of on a going forward basis  we do not expect this change to have a material effect on operating results because the amount of revenue deferred at the end of a given quarter should be largely offset by revenue carried over from the prior period

please see  item properties  disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments and note to our financial statements 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period last year 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to an increase in net income of million 
the largest use of cash was an increase in inventories of million 
the increase in merchandise inventory is required to support the continuing growth of the company 
cash used in investing activities increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period last year 
the current period capital expenditures consisted primarily of capital expenditures for store expansions and remodels of million compared to million in the prior period and computer equipment purchases of million in the current period compared to million in the same period last year 
additionally  we purchased available for sale securities of million and acquired a business for million in cash provided by financing activities totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million used in the same period last year

our principal working capital need is to provide for the inventory levels necessary to support our sales activities  particularly the guitar center retail stores 
inventory increased from million to million  or 
inventory per square foot at guitar center retail stores guitar center store and distribution center inventories under gaap divided by total store retail square footage on a given date was at december  compared to in our ongoing objective is to improve inventory performance by refining our replenishment processes and systems  utilizing a distribution center for our guitar center stores  and through improved planning  presentation and display of inventories in our retail stores 
we believe that our current operating cash flow  working capital  and cash and cash equivalents on hand will be sufficient to meet our obligations in the ordinary course of business  including capital expenditures and new store openings 
in the second quarter of  we expect to fund the closing of the music arts acquisition from available cash and drawings under our credit facility 
we intend to pursue an aggressive growth strategy by opening additional stores in new and existing markets 
during the year ended december   we opened new guitar center stores five large format and nine small format stores 
each new large format guitar center store typically has required approximately to million for gross inventory 
historically  our cost of capital improvements for a large format guitar center store has been approximately  consisting of leasehold improvements  fixtures and equipment 
we incur higher costs in some geographic areas  particularly the northeast  and when we build a larger flagship store 
we have developed smaller guitar center stores to build in secondary markets or sites that we do not believe will support our large format units 
the first of these units was opened in late and more had been opened as of december  our small format stores have typically incurred approximately  in capital expenditures and require approximately million to million in inventory 
we are also anticipating additional capital and strategic requirements related to improving our fulfillment facilities  upgrading our technology and systems  and pursuing new opportunities in the e commerce activities of our retail and direct response divisions as well as related businesses 
our distribution center in the indianapolis  indiana area supports our guitar center retail store operations 
we have a year agreement to lease the facility and we also have numerous additional commitments necessary to support the operations of the facility 
starting in  nearly all products flow through the distribution facility  with the exception of special orders which will continue  for the most part  to be drop shipped to our stores 
migration from our former drop ship model to a centralized distribution model is an important development in our operating strategy and has required the allocation of significant financial and managerial resources 
a portion of the costs of operating this facility are absorbed into our guitar center merchandise inventories and recognized as an element of cost of goods sold when the related inventory is sold 
we also continue to make significant investments in information technology across our businesses and to incur costs and make investments designed to expand the reach of our businesses on the internet 
the costs of these initiatives and other investments related to our businesses will continue to be significant 
our expansion strategy is to continue to increase our market share in existing markets and to penetrate strategically selected new markets 
we opened a total of guitar center stores in each of and  and currently anticipate opening to guitar center stores in approximately two thirds of the stores opened in are smaller format units designed for secondary markets 
during we expect to close the music arts acquisition and combine that business with our existing american music business 
we also continue to believe that there exists a number of additional acquisition opportunities in the relatively fragmented band instruments market that could be a good fit with our company and continue to pursue acquisition opportunities 
throughout our history  we have primarily grown organically  and we do not expect this to change 
however  we also believe there may be attractive opportunities to expand by selectively acquiring existing music products retailers or other complimentary businesses  if attractive opportunities can be identified 
while we cannot provide assurance that we will complete any further acquisition transactions  in the ordinary course of our business we investigate and engage in negotiations regarding such opportunities 
acquisitions will be financed with cash on hand  drawings under our existing credit facilities  expansion of our credit facilities  issuance of debt or equity securities  or a combination  depending upon transaction size and market conditions  among other things 
our known capital resource and liquidity requirements for are presently expected to be primarily provided by cash on hand  net cash flow from operations and  possibly  borrowings under our credit facility 
depending upon market conditions  we may also elect or be required to raise additional capital in the form of common or preferred equity  debt or convertible securities for the purpose of providing additional capital to fund working capital needs or continued growth of our existing business  or to refinance existing obligations 
any such financing activity will be dependent upon many factors  including our liquidity needs  market conditions and prevailing market terms  and we cannot assure you that future external financing for us will be available on attractive terms or at all
