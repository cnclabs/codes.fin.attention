item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
marketing and sales ethylene produced by the segment generally is consumed internally as a raw material in the production of derivatives  or is transferred by pipeline to related and unrelated parties 
for the year ended december   approximately of the segment s ethylene  based on sales dollars  was used by the segment s derivatives facilities or sold to related parties at market related prices 
the sales to related parties include significant ethylene sales to occidental chemical corporation a subsidiary of occidental petroleum corporation  which owns approximately of lyondell s outstanding common stock during pursuant to a long term ethylene supply agreement 
see integration 
the co products that are not consumed internally generally are sold to customers with whom lyondell has had long standing relationships 
these sales generally are made under written agreements that typically provide for monthly negotiation of price and customer purchases of a specified minimum quantity 
the segment consumes propylene in the production of polypropylene and also sells propylene to the po and related products segment at market related prices 
the segment s propylene production that is not consumed internally generally is sold under contracts that have initial terms ranging from two to six years and that typically contain automatic one to two year extension provisions 
in addition  pursuant to a long term propylene supply arrangement entered into in with a subsidiary of sunoco  inc  the ethylene  co products and derivatives segment supplies million pounds of propylene annually to sunoco 
under the arrangement  a majority of the propylene is supplied under a cost based formula and the balance is supplied on a market related basis 
this year supply arrangement replaced a previous contract under which the segment supplied million pounds of propylene annually to sunoco at market related prices

the segment generally sells its butadiene under contracts that have initial terms of three to five years and that typically contain automatic one to two year extension provisions 
the segment sells benzene to the po and related products segment and toluene to lcr at market related prices 
most of the segment s benzene and 
table of contents toluene production that is not consumed internally is sold under contracts that have initial terms ranging from three to five years and that typically contain automatic one year extension provisions 
the segment also sells benzene produced by lcr  which it purchases from lcr at market related prices 
the segment serves as lcr s sole agent to market toluene produced by lcr and receives a marketing fee for such services 
the ethylene  co products and derivatives segment at times purchases ethylene  propylene  benzene and butadiene for resale  when necessary  to satisfy customer demand for these products above production levels 
volumes of ethylene  propylene  benzene and butadiene purchased for resale can vary significantly from period to period 
however  purchased volumes generally do not have a significant impact on profitability 
mtbe produced at one of the two channelview units is transferred to the po and related products segment at market related prices or sold to lcr at market related prices 
mtbe is processed for lcr at the second channelview unit for a processing fee 
in addition  mtbe produced at chocolate bayou is transferred at market related prices to the po and related products segment 
most of the ethylene and propylene production of the channelview  chocolate bayou  corpus christi  la porte and lake charles facilities is shipped via a  mile pipeline system which has connections to numerous gulf coast ethylene and propylene consumers 
this pipeline system  some of which is owned and some of which is leased by equistar  extends from corpus christi to mont belvieu to port arthur  texas as well as around the lake charles  louisiana area 
in addition  exchange agreements with other ethylene and co products producers allow access to customers who are not directly connected to this pipeline system 
some ethylene is shipped by railcar from clinton  iowa to morris  illinois and also to customers 
a pipeline owned and operated by an unrelated party is used to transport ethylene from morris  illinois to tuscola  illinois 
some propylene is shipped by ocean going vessel 
butadiene  benzene  toluene and other products are distributed by pipeline  railcar  truck  barge or ocean going vessel 
polyethylene products primarily are sold to an extensive base of established customers 
approximately two thirds of the domestic polyethylene product volumes are sold to customers under contracts typically having a term of one to three years 
the remainder of the polyethylene volume generally is sold under customary terms and conditions without formal contracts 
in either case  in most of the continuous supply relationships  prices are subject to change upon mutual agreement 
eo and eg typically are sold under three to five year contracts  with market based pricing 
glycol ethers  ethanolamines and brake fluids are sold primarily into the solvent and distributor markets at market prices 
ethanol and ethers primarily are sold under contracts at market prices 
eo is shipped by railcar  and its derivatives are shipped by railcar  truck  isotank or ocean going vessel 
vam that is not consumed internally is sold into domestic and export markets under contracts with terms of one to seven years  and also on a spot basis 
acetic acid that is not consumed internally for the production of vam is sold into domestic and export markets under contracts with terms of one to five years  and also on a spot basis 
contract pricing generally is determined by market based negotiation  market index or cost based formulas 
millennium also has a long term agreement with dupont to convert acetic acid produced at the la porte  texas plant into vam through dupont s nearby vam plant and to acquire all of the vam production at dupont s plant not utilized internally by dupont 
the contract expires on december  but may be extended by mutual agreement thereafter from year to year 
vam and acetic acid are shipped by barge  ocean going vessel  pipeline  tank car and tank truck 
the segment has bulk storage arrangements in europe and asia to better serve its customers requirements in those regions 
sales are made through a direct sales force  agents and distributors 
the la porte  texas methanol facility is owned by la porte methanol company  a partnership owned by millennium and by linde 
each party receives its respective share of the methanol production 
the segment uses the methanol as a raw material for acetic acid and also sells the methanol under contracts that range 
table of contents in term from one to three years and on a spot basis to large domestic customers 
the product is shipped by barge and pipeline 
other derivatives products are primarily distributed by railcar 
the vast majority of the derivatives products are sold in north america and europe  primarily through lyondell s sales organization 
sales agents are generally engaged to market the derivatives products in the rest of the world 
no single acetyls customer accounted for or more of millennium s revenues in no single external ethylene  co products and derivatives customer accounted for or more of equistar s total revenues in for geographic data  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
competition and industry conditions the bases for competition in the ethylene  co products and derivatives businesses are price  product quality  product delivery  reliability of supply  product performance and customer service 
the segment s ethylene and co products compete with other large domestic producers of ethylene and co products  including bp plc bp  chevron phillips chemical company lp chevronphillips  enterprise products partners lp  exxon mobil corporation exxonmobil  huntsman chemical company huntsman and shell chemical company shell 
the segment s derivatives products compete with large producers of derivatives  including bp  celanese ag celanese  chevronphillips  the dow chemical company dow  eastman chemical company  exxonmobil  formosa plastics corporation  huntsman  methanex  nova chemicals corporation  saudi basic industries corp 
sabic  total and westlake polymers 
industry consolidation  including the combinations of british petroleum and amoco  exxon and mobil  and dow and union carbide and the formation of chevronphillips  has brought north american production capacity under the control of fewer  although larger  competitors 
lyondell s rated capacity at december  was approximately billion pounds per year  or approximately of total north american production capacity 
based on published rated production capacities  lyondell is the second largest producer of ethylene in north america 
north american ethylene rated capacity at december  was approximately billion pounds per year 
approximately of the total ethylene production capacity in north america is located along the gulf coast 
based on published rated industry capacities  lyondell is the third largest producer of polyethylene in north america 
the rated capacity of lyondell s polyethylene units as of december  was approximately billion pounds per year  or approximately of total industry capacity in north america 
there are many other north american producers of polyethylene  the most significant of which are chevronphillips  dow and exxonmobil 
lyondell is the second largest producer of vam and acetic acid in north america  and the third largest producer worldwide  based on published rated production capacity 
profitability of the segment is affected not only by supply and demand for ethylene  co products and derivatives  but also by raw material costs and vigorous price competition among producers  which may intensify due to  among other things  the addition of new capacity 
in  ethylene markets began a cyclical recovery from the downturn brought about by the prior three years of weak demand 
the shutdown of two of a competitor s gulf coast ethylene and co products plants in and improving demand  driven by worldwide economic recovery  resulted in greatly improved industry operating rates in in general  demand is a function of economic growth in the united states and elsewhere in the world  which fluctuates 
it is not possible to accurately predict the changes in raw material costs  market conditions  capacity utilization and other factors that will affect industry profitability in the future 

table of contents po and related products segment overview lyondell is a leading global manufacturer and marketer of intermediate chemicals and performance chemical products used in a broad range of consumer goods 
the po and related products segment s core product is po  which is produced through two distinct technologies based on indirect oxidation processes that yield co products 
one process yields tba as the co product  the other yields sm as the co product 
the two technologies are mutually exclusive  necessitating that a manufacturing facility be dedicated either to po tba or to po sm 
mtbe is the principal derivative of tba 
the po and related products segment also includes tdi and derivatives of po  including pg  pge and bdo 
in north america  the company produces po  tba  pg and pge at its bayport pasadena  texas plants and po  sm  mtbe and bdo at its channelview  texas plants

the company estimates  based in part on published data  that worldwide demand for po was approximately billion pounds in approximately of that volume was consumed in the manufacture of three families of po derivative products polyols  glycols and glycol ethers 
the remainder was consumed in the manufacture of a growing segment of performance products  including bdo and its derivatives 
polyols are used primarily in the production of polyurethanes 
the company sells approximately billion pounds of its annual capacity of po in the merchant market and consumes the rest in the production of derivatives 
po sold in the merchant market accounted for approximately of lyondell s total revenues in  in and in pg principally is used to produce unsaturated polyester resins and also is used in certain food  cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications and in automotive coolants and aircraft deicers 
pge are used as solvents for paints  coatings and cleaners 
bdo and its derivatives are utilized in the production of fibers  engineering plastics  pharmaceuticals  personal care products and high performance coatings 
tdi also is used primarily in the production of polyurethanes for flexible foam applications ranging from furniture  bedding and carpet underlay to transportation and packaging 
additionally  tdi is used in the manufacture of coatings  sealants  adhesives and elastomers 
sm is produced and sold worldwide for commodity and specialty polymer applications  such as polystyrene and unsaturated polyester resins  as well as various uses in the rubber industry 
based on published data  worldwide demand for sm in was approximately billion pounds 
sm accounted for approximately of lyondell s total revenues in and and in lyondell converts most of its tba to isobutylene  which is reacted with methanol to produce mtbe  an oxygenated gasoline blending component that increases octane and reduces automotive emissions 
mtbe accounted for approximately of lyondell s total revenues in  in and in at its 
table of contents fos sur mer  france facility  lyondell also converts some of its isobutylene to etbe  an alternative to mtbe that is produced by the reaction of isobutylene with agriculturally produced ethanol 
lyondell produces etbe at the fos sur mer  france facility to address europe s growing demand for biofuels  in accordance with market conditions 
worldwide demand for mtbe in is estimated to have been approximately  to  barrels per day  based on published data 
in the united states  the clean air act amendments of set minimum levels for oxygenates  such as mtbe  in gasoline sold in areas not meeting specified air quality standards 
however  the presence of mtbe in some water supplies in california and other states due to gasoline leaking from underground storage tanks and in surface water from recreational water craft has led to public concern about the use of mtbe 
certain us states have banned the use of mtbe  while other us federal and state governmental initiatives have sought either to rescind the oxygen requirement for reformulated gasoline or to restrict or also ban the use of mtbe 
for example  california  connecticut and new york banned the use of mtbe  effective january  lyondell s north american mtbe sales represented approximately of lyondell s total revenues in  in and in lyondell intends to install equipment at its channelview  texas facility that would provide lyondell with the flexibility to produce di isobutylene  an alternative gasoline component  instead of mtbe at that facility

raw materials the primary raw materials purchased by the po and related products segment are propylene  butane  ethylene  benzene and methanol 
the market prices of these raw materials historically have been related to the price of crude oil and its principal refinery derivatives  natural gas liquids  and natural gas  as well as market conditions for these materials 
these materials are received in bulk quantities via pipeline or marine vessels 
generally  the segment s raw materials requirements are purchased at market based prices from numerous suppliers in the united states and europe with which the company has established contractual relationships  as well as in the spot market 
the po and related products segment obtains propylene  benzene and ethylene raw materials from the ethylene  co products and derivatives segment and expects the ethylene  co products and derivatives segment to be the major supplier of these raw materials to the us po and related products businesses in raw materials for the non us businesses primarily are obtained from unrelated parties 
see integration below and note to the consolidated financial statements 
the po and related products segment is a large volume consumer of isobutane for chemical production 
the company has invested in facilities  or entered into processing agreements with unrelated parties  to convert the widely available commodity  normal butane  to isobutane 
the segment also is a large consumer of oxygen for its po tba plants at bayport  texas  botlek rotterdam  the netherlands  and fos sur mer  france 
in december  the company entered into an agreement for methanex to become the exclusive supplier of the worldwide methanol raw material requirements for the company other than its acetyls businesses  which the company acquired in november 
the agreement provides supplies of methanol at cost based prices and is being phased in over time beginning in and extending through methanex has an option to extend the agreement for an additional three year period 
the cost of raw materials generally is the largest component of total production cost for the po and related products business 
the segment s raw materials are  in general  commodity chemicals with numerous bulk suppliers and ready availability at competitive prices 
historically  raw material availability has not been an issue 
however  in order to enhance reliability and competitiveness of prices and rates for supplies of raw materials  industrial gas and other utilities  the company is party to long term agreements and other

marketing and sales in  most of the segment s revenues were derived from sales to  or processing agreements with  unrelated parties 
in  no single po and related products customer accounted for or more of lyondell s total revenues 
the po and related products segment produces and delivers products through sales agreements  processing agreements and spot sales as well as product exchanges 
production levels at lyondell s po sm and po tba co product production facilities primarily are determined by the demand for po and po derivatives 
the resulting production levels of co products sm and mtbe thus depend primarily on the demand for po and po derivatives and secondarily on the relative market demand for sm and mtbe  as well as the operational flexibility of lyondell s multiple production facilities in meeting this demand 
lyondell purchases sm and mtbe for resale  when necessary  to satisfy customer demand for these co products above co product production levels 
volumes of sm and mtbe purchases made for resale can vary significantly from period to period 
however  purchased volumes have not historically had a significant impact on profitability 
lyondell has a number of multi year po processing or tolling and sales agreements in an effort to mitigate the adverse impact of competitive factors and economic business cycles on demand for the segment s po

table of contents inorganic chemicals segment overview lyondell s inorganic chemicals businesses are conducted through millennium  which has been a wholly owned subsidiary since lyondell s november  acquisition of millennium 
tio is the primary product of the inorganic chemicals segment  which accounted for approximately of millennium s total revenues in  in and in tio is a white pigment used for imparting whiteness  brightness  opacity and durability in a wide range of products  including paint and coatings  plastics  paper and elastomers 
as of december   the inorganic chemicals segment s annual tio production capacity  using the chloride process and the sulfate process discussed below  was approximately  metric tons 
unless otherwise specified  annual processing capacities were calculated by estimating the number of days in a typical year that a production unit of a plant is expected to operate  after allowing downtime for regular maintenance  and multiplying that number by an amount equal to the unit s optimal daily output 
because the processing capacity of a production unit is an estimated amount  actual production volumes may be more or less than capacities set forth below 
tio production process annual capacity percentage of capacity chloride process  metric tons sulfate process  metric tons total  metric tons tio is produced in two crystalline forms rutile and anatase 
rutile tio has better opacification and tinting strength in many applications  and some rutile tio products also provide better resistance to the harmful effects of weather 
as a result  rutile tio is the preferred form for use in paint and coatings  ink and plastics 
anatase tio has a bluer undertone and is less abrasive than rutile and  therefore  is often preferred for use in paper  ceramics  rubber and man made fibers 
tio is manufactured using two different technologies 
the newer chloride process is a high temperature process in which chlorine is used to produce an intermediate tio rutile crystal pigment  with greater purity and higher control over the size distribution of the pigment particles than the alternative sulfate process permits 
in general  the chloride process is also less intensive than the sulfate process in terms of labor and energy 
because much of the chlorine can be recycled  the chloride process produces less waste than does the sulfate process 
the sulfate process is a wet chemical process that uses concentrated sulfuric acid to produce either an intermediate tio anatase or rutile crystal pigment 
the sulfate process generates higher volumes of waste  including iron sulfate and spent sulfuric acid 
once an intermediate tio pigment has been produced by either the chloride or sulfate process  it is processed into a product with specific performance characteristics for particular end use applications through proprietary processes involving surface treatment with various chemicals and combinations of milling and micronizing 
the inorganic chemicals segment s tio plants are located in the four major world markets for tio north america  south america  western europe and the asia pacific region 
the north american plants  consisting of one in baltimore  maryland and two in ashtabula  ohio  use the chloride process 
the plant in salvador  bahia  brazil uses the sulfate process 
the segment also owns a mineral sands mine located at mataraca  paraiba  brazil  which supplies the brazilian plant with titanium ores 
the mine has over two million metric tons of recoverable reserves 
the mine produced approximately  metric tons of ilmenite  a titanium bearing ore  in 
table of contents approximately  metric tons of ilmenite produced at the mine were used internally by the salvador tio 

plant  while approximately metric tons were sold to unrelated parties 
the mine also produced approximately  metric tons of zircon and approximately  metric tons of natural rutile titanium ore  substantially all of which were sold to unrelated parties 
the stallingborough  united kingdom plant uses the chloride process 
the plants in france at le havre  normandy and thann  alsace use the sulfate process 
the kemerton plant in western australia uses the chloride process 
the inorganic chemicals segment also produces a number of specialty and performance tio related products  some of which are manufactured at dedicated plants and others of which are manufactured at plants that also produce other tio products 
these products include titanium tetrachloride ticl  titanyl sulfate ticl  ultra fine ticl  silica gel and cadmium based pigments 
raw materials naturally occurring titanium bearing ores such as ilmenite and natural rutile occur as sand or hard rock deposits in many parts of the world and are used as raw materials in the tio extraction process 
mining companies are increasingly treating ilmenite to extract iron and other minerals to produce slag or synthetic rutile with higher tio concentrations  resulting in lower amounts of wastes and by products during processing by tio pigment plants 
generally  titanium bearing ores are shipped by using bulk carriers from terminals in the country of origin to tio production plants  usually located near port facilities 
the segment obtains ores from a number of suppliers in south africa  australia  canada  brazil  india and ukraine  generally pursuant to one to six year supply contracts expiring between and rio tinto iron titanium inc through its affiliates richards bay iron titanium proprietary limited and qit fer et titane inc and iluka resources limited are the world s largest producers of titanium ores and upgraded titaniferous raw materials and accounted for approximately of the titanium ores and upgraded titaniferous raw materials purchased by millennium in other major raw materials used in the production of tio are chlorine  caustic soda  coke  aluminum  sodium silicate  sodium aluminate  sulfuric acid  oxygen  nitrogen and natural gas 
the number of sources for and availability of these materials is specific to the particular geographic region in which a facility is located 
there are certain risks related to the acquisition of raw materials from less developed or developing countries 
see risks and other factors that may affect lyondell  its subsidiaries and its joint ventures international operations and country risks 
a number of the raw materials used by the inorganic chemicals segment in the production of tio and the segment s other products are provided by only a few vendors and  accordingly  if one significant supplier or a number of significant suppliers were unable to meet their obligations under present supply arrangements  the inorganic chemicals segment could suffer reduced supplies and or be forced to incur increased costs for these raw materials 
for example  for the australian plant  chlorine and caustic soda are obtained exclusively from one supplier under a long term supply agreement 
see risks and other factors that may affect lyondell  its subsidiaries and its joint ventures raw materials and energy costs 
however  at the present time  chloride and sulfate process raw materials are available in sufficient quantities 
marketing and sales of the tio sold by the inorganic chemicals segment in  approximately was sold to customers in the paint and coatings industry  approximately to customers in the plastics industry  approximately to customers in the paper industry  and approximately to other customers 
the inorganic chemicals segment experiences some seasonality in its tio 

sales because  in general  its customers production of paint and coatings are greatest in the spring and summer months 
tio generally is sold by the segment at prices determined by market based negotiation under contracts that range from two to five years  typically with automatic one year extension provisions 
tio is sold either directly to customers or  to a lesser extent  through agents or distributors  and is distributed by rail  truck and ocean carrier in either dry or slurry form 

table of contents no single inorganic chemicals customer accounted for or more of millennium s total revenues in for geographic data  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
competition and industry conditions the bases for competition in the inorganic chemicals businesses are price  product quality  product performance  product delivery  customer service and reliability of supply 
certain inorganic chemicals competitors are more vertically integrated than lyondell s inorganic chemicals segment  producing titanium bearing ores as well as tio the inorganic chemicals segment is vertically integrated at the brazilian facility  which owns the titanium ore mine that supplies that facility 
the major competitors in the tio business are dupont  kerr mcgee chemical corporation kerr mcgee chemicals  a unit of kerr mcgee corporation  both directly and through various joint ventures  huntsman tioxide huntsman tioxide  a business segment of huntsman international llc  and kronos worldwide  inc kronos 
lyondell estimates that collectively  as of december   dupont  lyondell  kerr mcgee chemicals  huntsman tioxide and kronos accounted for approximately of the world s tio production capacity 
lyondell is the second largest producer of tio in the world  based on published rated capacity 
in certain applications  tio competes with other whitening agents that are generally less effective but less expensive 
these alternate products include kaolin clays  calcium carbonate pigments  both ground and precipitated forms  and synthetic polymers materials 
generally  new plant capacity additions in the tio industry are slow to develop because of the substantial capital expenditure required and the significant lead time three to five years typically for a new plant needed for planning  obtaining environmental approvals and permits  construction of manufacturing facilities and arranging for raw material supplies 
debottlenecking and other capacity expansions at existing plants require substantially less time and capital and can increase overall industry capacity 
other chemicals lyondell also produces fragrance and flavors chemicals 
the brunswick  georgia and jacksonville  florida facilities manufacture terpene based fragrance ingredients and flavor ingredients  primarily for the oral care markets 
these products also are used in a number of other applications  including chemical reaction agents  or initiators  for the rubber industry and solvents and cleaners  such as pine oil  for the hard surface cleaner markets 
refining segment overview lyondell participates in petroleum refining through an equity interest in lcr  a limited partnership organized under the laws of the state of delaware 
lyondell holds a interest in lcr and citgo holds a interest in lcr 
lyondell owns its interest in lcr through wholly owned subsidiaries  which serve as general partner and limited partner 
similarly  citgo  which is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of pdvsa  the national oil company of venezuela  owns its interest in lcr through wholly owned subsidiaries  which serve as general partner and limited partner 
lcr owns and operates a refinery the refinery  which is located on the houston ship channel in houston  texas 
lcr was formed in to upgrade the refinery s ability to process substantial volumes of lower cost  heavy  high sulfur crude oil 
as of december   the refinery s heavy  high sulfur crude oil processing capacity was approximately  barrels per day 
the refinery is a full conversion refinery designed to run heavy to degrees api  high sulfur crude oil 
this crude oil is more viscous and dense than traditional crude oil and contains higher concentrations of 
table of contents sulfur and heavy metals  making it more difficult to refine into gasoline and other high value fuel products  but less costly to purchase 
processing heavy  high sulfur crude oil in significant quantities requires a refinery with extensive coking  catalytic cracking  hydrotreating and desulfurization capabilities  ie  a complex refinery 
the refinery s complexity enables it to operate in full conversion mode  producing a slate of products that consists primarily of high value  clean products due to a lack of conversion equipment  many refineries produce significant quantities of lower value products such as conventional gasoline  high sulfur diesel and heavy fuel oil 
the refinery s clean products include premium grades such as reformulated gasoline  jet fuel  low sulfur diesel and aromatics 
the refinery s products also include conventional gasoline  lube oils industrial lubricants  white oils and process oils  carbon black oil  refinery grade propylene  sulfur  residual fuel and petroleum coke 
gasoline accounted for approximately of lcr s total revenues in and in and diesel accounted for approximately of lcr s total revenues in and in and the aromatics produced by the refinery are benzene  toluene  orthoxylene and paraxylene 
these products are sold to manufacturers of intermediate chemicals and polyester intermediates and are ultimately used in clothing  soft drink bottles and drinking cups  audio and video tapes  and resins 
the following table outlines the refining segment s primary products  annual rated capacity on a calendar day basis as of december   and the primary uses for such products 
the term rated capacity  as used in this table  is calculated by estimating the number of days in a typical year that a production unit of a plant is expected to operate  after allowing for downtime for regular maintenance  and multiplying that number by an amount equal to the unit s optimal daily output based on the design raw material mix 
because the rated capacity of a production unit is an estimated amount  the actual production volumes may be more or less than the rated capacity 
capacities shown represent of the capacity of lcr  of which lyondell owns 
product rated capacity primary uses gasoline a  barrels per day automotive fuel diesel distillate a  barrels per day fuel for diesel cars and trucks jet fuel a  barrels per day aviation fuel benzene b million gallons per year nylon for clothing and consumer items  polystyrene for insulation  packaging and drink cups toluene c million gallons per year gasoline component and chemical raw material for producing benzene paraxylene d million pounds per year polyester fibers for clothing and fabrics  pet soft drink bottles and films for audio and video tapes orthoxylene d million pounds per year plasticizer in products such as rainwear  shower curtains  toys and auto upholstery and an intermediate in paints and fiberglass lube oils a  barrels per day automotive and industrial engine and lube oils  railroad engine additives and white oils for food grade applications a produced by lcr and sold to citgo 
b produced by lcr and sold to the ethylene  co products and derivatives segment 
c produced by lcr and marketed for lcr by the ethylene  co products and derivatives segment 
d produced by lcr and marketed for lcr by citgo 
management of lcr lcr is governed by a limited partnership agreement the lcr partnership agreement  which provides that lcr is managed by a partnership governance committee composed of six representatives  three of whom are appointed by each general partner 
the day to day operations of the refinery are managed by a general manager  who is a loaned employee of lyondell 
lyondell and citgo also perform various administrative services for lcr pursuant to an administrative services agreement 

table of contents raw materials in  lcr entered into a long term crude supply agreement the crude supply agreement with pdvsa petr leo  sa pdvsa oil  an affiliate of citgo and of pdvsa 
most of the crude oil used by lcr as a raw material for its refinery is purchased under the crude supply agreement 
both pdvsa oil and citgo are direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of pdvsa 
the crude supply agreement  which expires on december   incorporates formula prices to be paid by lcr for the crude oil supplied based on the market value of a slate of refined products deemed to be produced from each particular crude oil or raw material  less certain deemed refining costs  adjustable for inflation and energy costs  certain actual costs  and a deemed margin  which varies according to the grade of crude oil or other raw material delivered 
the actual refining margin earned by lcr may vary from the formula amount depending on  among other things  timing differences in incorporating changes in refined product market values and energy costs into the crude supply agreement s deemed margin calculations and the efficiency with which lcr conducts its operations 
although lcr believes that the crude supply agreement reduces the volatility of lcr s earnings and cash flows over the long term  the crude supply agreement also limits lcr s ability to enjoy higher margins during periods when the market price of crude oil is low relative to the then current market prices for refined products 
in addition  if the actual yields  costs or volumes of the lcr refinery differ substantially from those contemplated by the crude supply agreement  the benefits of this agreement to lcr could be substantially diminished  and could result in lower earnings and cash flow for lcr 
furthermore  there may be periods during which lcr s costs for crude oil under the crude supply agreement may be higher than might otherwise be available to lcr from other sources 
expansion or contraction of the average market heavy crude oil refining margin can result in situations in which the crude supply agreement per barrel margin is either greater than or less than the margin that could be obtained through open market purchases of heavy crude oil 
for example  during to and the early portion of  the crude supply agreement contract was advantageous to lcr  however  during the fourth quarter of  the crude supply agreement per barrel margin was less than the margin that could be obtained through open market purchases of heavy crude oil 
the crude supply agreement provides that lyondell controls all of lcr s decisions and enforcement rights in connection with the crude supply agreement so long as pdvsa has a direct or indirect ownership interest in lcr 
however  there are risks associated with reliance on pdvsa oil for supplies of crude oil and with enforcing the provisions of contracts with companies such as pdvsa oil that are non united states affiliates of a sovereign nation 
all of the crude oil supplied by pdvsa oil under the crude supply agreement is produced in venezuela  which has experienced economic difficulties and attendant social and political changes and unrest in recent years  including a national strike during the fourth quarter and the first quarter that disrupted crude oil deliveries to lcr 
venezuela may continue to experience these difficulties and changes 
it is impossible to predict how governmental policies may change under the current or any subsequent venezuelan government 
in addition  there are risks associated with enforcing judgments of united states courts against entities whose assets are located outside of the united states and whose management does not reside in the united states 
although the parties have negotiated certain alternative arrangements in the event of specified force majeure conditions  including venezuelan governmental or other actions restricting or otherwise limiting pdvsa oil s ability to perform its obligations  any such alternative arrangements may not be as beneficial to lcr as the crude supply agreement 
from time to time  the company and pdvsa have had discussions covering both a restructuring of the crude supply agreement and a broader restructuring of the lcr partnership 
the company is unable to predict whether changes in either arrangement will occur 
if the crude supply agreement is modified or terminated or this source of crude oil is otherwise interrupted  due to production difficulties  political or economic events in venezuela or other factors  lcr could experience significantly lower earnings and cash flows 
subject to the consent of the other partner and rights of first offer and first refusal  the partners each have a right to transfer their interests in lcr to unaffiliated third parties in certain circumstances 
if neither citgo  pdvsa oil nor their affiliates were a partner in lcr  pdvsa oil would have an option to terminate the crude supply agreement 
depending on then current market conditions  
table of contents any breach or termination of the crude supply agreement  or reduction in supply thereunder  would require lcr to purchase all or a portion of its crude oil in the merchant market  could subject lcr to significant volatility and price fluctuations and could adversely affect lcr and  therefore  lyondell 
alternative crude oil supplies with similar margins may not be available for purchase by lcr 
under the crude supply agreement  pdvsa oil is required to sell  and lcr is required to purchase   barrels per day of heavy crude oil  which constitutes approximately of lcr s refining capacity of  barrels per day of crude oil 
since april  pdvsa oil has  from time to time  declared itself in a force majeure situation and subsequently reduced deliveries of crude oil 
such reductions in deliveries were purportedly based on announced opec production cuts 
at such times  pdvsa oil informed lcr that the venezuelan government  through the ministry of energy and mines  had instructed that production of certain grades of crude oil be reduced 
in certain circumstances  pdvsa oil made payments to lcr under a different provision of the crude supply agreement in partial compensation for such reductions 
in january  pdvsa oil again declared itself in a force majeure situation and  beginning in march  reduced deliveries of crude oil to lcr 
although deliveries increased to contract levels of  barrels per day during the third quarter  pdvsa oil did not revoke its january force majeure declaration during a national strike in venezuela began in early december and disrupted deliveries of crude oil to lcr under the crude supply agreement 
pdvsa oil again declared a force majeure and reduced deliveries of crude oil to lcr 
in march  pdvsa oil notified lcr that the force majeure had been lifted with respect to crude oil under the crude supply agreement 
for additional discussion regarding the effects of the political unrest in venezuela on operating performance  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
lcr has consistently contested the validity of pdvsa oil s and pdvsa s reductions in deliveries under the crude supply agreement 
the parties have different interpretations of the provisions of the contracts concerning the delivery of crude oil 
the contracts do not contain dispute resolution procedures  and the parties have been unable to resolve their commercial dispute 
as a result  on february   lcr filed a lawsuit against pdvsa and pdvsa oil in connection with the force majeure declarations  which lcr is continuing to litigate 
see item legal proceedings litigation matters 
marketing and sales the refinery produces gasoline  low sulfur diesel  jet fuel  aromatics  lube oils and certain industrial products 
on a weekly basis  lcr evaluates and determines the optimal product output mix for the refinery  based on spot market prices and conditions 
under a long term product sales agreement the products agreement  citgo is obligated to purchase and lcr is required to sell of the finished gasoline  jet fuel  heating oil  diesel fuel  coke and sulfur produced by the refinery 
citgo purchases these products at market related prices based on regional industry benchmark indexes 
for example  the price for gasoline is based on prices published by platts oilgram  an industry trade publication 
the products agreement provides that lyondell controls all of lcr s material decisions and enforcement rights in connection with the products agreement so long as citgo has a direct or indirect ownership interest in lcr 
the products agreement expires on december  under the terms of lubricant sales agreements expiring on december   citgo purchases all of the lube oils manufactured by lcr 
in addition  citgo serves as lcr s sole agent to market paraxylene and orthoxylene produced by lcr 
the ethylene  co products and derivatives segment purchases benzene produced by lcr  and also serves as lcr s sole agent to market toluene produced by lcr 
competition and industry conditions the refining business tends to be volatile as well as cyclical 
crude oil prices  which are impacted by worldwide political events and the economics of exploration and production in addition to refined products demand  are the largest source of the volatility 
demand for refined products is influenced by seasonal and short 
table of contents term factors such as weather and driving patterns  as well as by longer term issues such as the economy  energy conservation and alternative fuels 
industry refined products supply is also dependent on industry operating capabilities and on long term refining capacity trends 
management believes that the combination of the crude supply agreement and the products agreement generally has the effect of stabilizing earnings and cash flows and reducing the market driven aspects of the business volatility over the long term 
with a capacity of approximately  barrels per day  the company believes that the refinery is one of north america s largest full conversion ie  not producing asphalt or high sulfur heavy fuel refineries capable of processing heavy  high sulfur crude oil 
among lcr s refining competitors are major integrated oil companies and domestic refiners that are owned by or affiliated with major integrated oil companies 
based on published industry data  as of december   there were crude oil refineries in operation in the united states  and total domestic refinery capacity was approximately million barrels per day 
during  lcr processed an average of  barrels per day of crude oil or approximately of all us crude capacity 
integration the lyondell businesses are integrated across several parts of the product chain  with products from one operation being used as raw materials for conversion to other products 
other forms of internal integration consist of sharing resources  including physical assets and human resources  across different businesses 
these forms of integration create value within and across the four lyondell businesses 
for example  equistar produces ethylene and other products 
this ethylene is then used as a raw material in derivatives such as polyethylene and vam within the ethylene  co products and derivatives business segment  and styrene within the po and related products business segment 
the ethylene also is sold to other parties  including occidental  which owns approximately of lyondell s common stock and was a partner in equistar from to the four lyondell businesses also share common plant sites  which increases efficiencies in many ways  such as minimizing transportation costs and sharing overhead costs 
in addition  the costs of corporate services and other staff functions are minimized by sharing them across a larger  more integrated enterprise 
lyondell seeks to maximize value by optimizing these relationships to support the entire enterprise in the most efficient manner 
lyondell believes that the transactions discussed in this section are on terms substantially no more or less favorable than those that would be agreed upon by third parties on an arm s length basis 
these arrangements provide benefits to all parties 
for example  the long term ethylene sales arrangements with lyondell s businesses and with occidental provide equistar with long term customers and provide lyondell and occidental with a long term source of a raw material 
lyondell generally expects that similar transactions will occur during product integration within each lyondell business  primary products are converted into derivative products 
for example  ethylene is used as a raw material for derivative products  such as polyethylene and eo  within the ethylene  co products and derivatives businesses of equistar 
approximately of the ethylene produced is used internally by equistar for these products 
also  within the ethylene  co products and derivatives segment  equistar sold approximately million of ethylene to millennium in for use as a raw material in the production of the ethylene derivative vam  and purchased approximately million of vam and glacial acetic acid from millennium for use in making various equistar products 
the ethylene  co products and derivatives segment transfers propylene to the po and related products segment  at market related prices  for use as a raw material in po and related products 
approximately of lyondell s po capacity  excluding the po capacity represented by lyondell s partners in joint ventures  is converted into derivatives  such as pg  pge  and bdo 

table of contents the equistar ethylene  co products and derivatives businesses provide ethylene  propylene  benzene and toluene to the lyondell po and related product businesses for styrene  po and tdi production 
during  the po and related product businesses acquired approximately million of raw materials and mtbe from equistar s ethylene  co products and derivatives businesses 
conversely  the ethylene  co products and derivatives businesses acquired approximately million of by products from the po and related products businesses in for producing ethylene and its co products 
in  lyondell s subsidiary  equistar  purchased approximately million of refined products from lcr  for use in producing ethylene and its co products 
equistar sells ethylene co products and mtbe to lcr for processing into refining products 
lcr purchased approximately million of these products from equistar for processing into gasoline in equistar also processes lcr butylenes into alkylate and mtbe and occasionally sells additional alkylate to lcr 
in other cases  products are sold from one lyondell business to another better able to market the product for resale to customers 
for example  equistar purchases benzene from lcr for resale to equistar s customers  and equistar also serves as lcr s sole agent to market toluene 
product integration is monitored and adjustments are made based on changing market conditions in an effort to take full advantage of these related businesses being operated together 
commercial transactions with occidental during  lyondell s subsidiary  equistar  sold approximately million of ethylene  ethers and glycols to occidental 
during  lyondell purchased less than million of sodium methylate and caustic soda from occidental  which are used in the production of po and derivatives 
equistar also purchased various other products from occidental at market related prices totaling approximately million in millennium purchased approximately million of sodium silicate and other products from occidental during properties principal manufacturing facilities and mine the principal manufacturing facilities and mine are set forth below  and are identified by the principal segment or segments using the facility or mine

table of contents risks and other factors that may affect lyondell  its subsidiaries and its joint ventures there are many factors that may affect the businesses and results of operations of lyondell  its subsidiaries and joint ventures 
some of these factors are discussed below 
for additional discussion regarding factors that may affect the businesses and operating results of lyondell and its subsidiaries and joint ventures  see items and business and properties  forward looking statements  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and item a 
disclosure of market and regulatory risk 
industry cyclicality and overcapacity lyondell s historical operating results reflect the cyclical and volatile nature of the supply demand balance in both the chemical and refining industries  and its future operating results continue to be affected by this cyclicality and volatility 
these industries historically have experienced alternating periods of capacity shortages leading to tight supply  causing prices and profit margins to increase  followed by periods when substantial capacity is added  resulting in oversupply  declining capacity utilization rates and declining prices and profit margins 
the cyclicality of these industries results in volatile profits and cash flow over the business cycles 
the chemical industry has entered a period characterized by tight supply in many product areas and increased demand as the global economy continues to improve 
product growth has returned to historical levels and  in some cases  has exceeded them 
as a result  the industry has seen a return to enhanced profitability  even in a world of volatile raw material and energy costs 
however  the sustainability of these positive business conditions remains subject to uncertainty 
the global economic and political environment continues to be uncertain  and negative changes could result in a decline in demand 
when coupled with new capacity additions by some participants in the industry  especially those in the middle east and asia which are expected to startup in the middle to latter part of the decade  the current positive business conditions could be depressed  eventually leading to another period of oversupply and poor profitability 
raw materials and energy costs lyondell purchases large amounts of raw materials and energy for its businesses 
the cost of these raw materials and energy  in the aggregate  represents a substantial portion of its operating expenses 
the costs of raw materials and energy used for most of its products generally follow price trends of  and vary with the market conditions for  crude oil and natural gas  which may be highly volatile and cyclical 
raw material costs have increased through and remain at high levels 
there have been in the past  and will likely be in the future  periods of time when lyondell is unable to pass raw material cost increases on to customers quickly enough to avoid adverse impacts on its results of operations 
in addition  customer consolidation has made it more difficult to pass along cost increases to customers 
lyondell s results of operations have been  and could be in the future  significantly affected by increases and volatility in these costs 
cost increases may increase working capital needs  which could reduce lyondell s liquidity and cash flow 
see competitive markets below 
in addition  higher north american natural gas prices relative to natural gas cost advantaged regions  such as the middle east  have diminished the ability of many domestic chemical producers to compete internationally since natural gas prices affect a significant portion of the industry s raw materials and energy sources 
this environment has in the past caused and may in the future cause a reduction in equistar s exports  and has in the past reduced and may in the future reduce the competitiveness of us producers 
it also has in the past increased the competition for sales of chemicals in north america  as us production that would otherwise have been sold overseas was instead offered for sale domestically  resulting in excess supply and lower margins in north america  and may do so in the future 
furthermore  across lyondell  there are a limited number of suppliers for some of its raw materials and utilities and  in some cases  the number of sources for and availability of raw materials is specific to the 
table of contents particular geographic region in which a facility is located 
for example  for the inorganic chemicals segment  raw materials generally have been purchased pursuant to one year to six year supply contracts that expire between and in  the inorganic chemicals segment purchased approximately of its titanium ores and titaniferous raw materials from two suppliers  rio tinto iron titanium inc through its affiliates richards bay iron titanium proprietary limited and qit fer et titane inc and iluka resources limited  under multiple year contractual commitments 
in addition  the inorganic chemicals segment obtains chlorine and caustic soda exclusively from one supplier for its australian operations under a long term supply agreement 
moreover  lyondell purchases all of its carbon monoxide for its acetyls from linde ag pursuant to a long term contract based primarily on the cost of production 
each of lyondell s chloride tio manufacturing plants has long term supply agreements for oxygen and nitrogen through either nearby suppliers dedicated to the site or through a direct pipeline arrangement 
each of these contracts is an exclusive supply contract 
accordingly  if one of these suppliers were unable to meet its obligations under present supply arrangements  the inorganic chemicals segment could suffer reduced supplies or be forced to incur increased costs for its raw materials  which would have a direct negative impact on plant operations 
general economic conditions and other external factors external factors beyond lyondell s or lcr s control can cause volatility in the price of raw materials and other operating costs  as well as significant fluctuations in demand for its products and can magnify the impact of economic cycles on its businesses 
examples of external factors include general economic conditions  international events and circumstances  competitor actions  and governmental regulation in the us and abroad 
lyondell believes that events in the middle east have had a particularly adverse influence on its businesses in recent years and may continue to do so 
in addition  a number of lyondell s products are highly dependent on durable goods markets  such as the housing and automotive markets  which also are cyclical 
many of lyondell s products are components of other chemical products that  in turn  are subject to the supply demand balance of both the chemical and refining industries and general economic conditions 
the global economy has continued to improve  increasing demand for lyondell s products and resulting in improved operating results as operations begin to approach full capacity 
this has occurred even as the volatility and elevated level of prices for crude oil and natural gas have resulted in increased raw material costs 
however  the impact of the factors cited above may once again cause a slowdown in the business cycle  reducing demand and lowering operating rates and  ultimately  reducing profitability 
although lyondell s and lcr s access to capital currently is not impeded  these same risks could increase instability in the financial markets and make lyondell s and lcr s ability to access capital more difficult 
with respect to lcr  management believes that the combination of the crude supply agreement and the products agreement generally tends to stabilize earnings and to reduce market driven volatility over the long term 
however  there are risks associated with these agreements 
see international operations and country risks below 
lyondell may reduce production at or idle a facility for an extended period of time or exit a business because of high raw material prices  an oversupply of a particular product and or a lack of demand for that particular product  which makes production uneconomical 
any decision to permanently close facilities or exit a business would result in impairment and other charges to earnings 
temporary outages sometimes last for several quarters or  in certain cases  longer  and could cause lyondell to incur costs  including the expenses of maintaining and restarting these facilities 
it is possible that factors such as increases in raw material costs or lower demand in the future will cause lyondell to reduce operating rates  idle facilities or exit uncompetitive businesses 
international operations and country risks lyondell has substantial international operations  which are subject to the risks of doing business abroad  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  transportation delays and interruptions  political and economic instability and disruptions  restrictions on the transfer of funds  the imposition of duties and tariffs  import and export controls  changes in governmental policies  labor unrest and current and changing regulatory 
table of contents environments 
these events could reduce the demand for its products internationally or decrease the prices at which it can sell its products internationally  which could reduce its operating results 
in addition  the inorganic chemicals segment and the ethylene  co products and derivatives segment obtain a substantial portion of their principal raw materials from sources outside the us  which are subject to these same risks 
although lyondell has compliance programs and processes intended to ensure compliance with applicable customs  currency exchange control regulations  transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which it may be subject  lyondell is subject to the risk that its compliance could be challenged 
furthermore  these laws may be modified  the result of which may be to prevent or limit foreign subsidiaries from transferring cash to lyondell 
for geographic data  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  lyondell generates revenue from export sales and operations conducted outside the us that may be denominated in currencies other than the relevant functional currency 
exchange rates between these currencies and us dollars in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future 
future events  which may significantly increase or decrease the risk of future movement in foreign currencies in which it conducts its business  cannot be predicted 
lyondell also may hedge certain revenues and costs using derivative instruments to minimize the impact of changes in the exchange rates of those currencies compared to the respective functional currencies 
it is possible that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates will result in reduced operating results 
as discussed earlier  lcr is party to a long term crude supply agreement with pdvsa oil  a wholly owned subsidiary of pdvsa 
there are risks associated with enforcing the provisions of contracts with companies such as pdvsa oil that are non us affiliates of a sovereign nation 
additionally  all of the crude oil supplied by pdvsa oil under the crude supply agreement is produced in venezuela  which has experienced economic difficulties and attendant social and political changes and unrest in recent years 
see items and business and properties refining segment raw materials  item legal proceedings litigation matters and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
competitive markets lyondell sells its products in highly competitive markets 
due to the commodity nature of certain of its products  competition in these markets is based primarily on price and to a lesser extent on product performance  product quality  product deliverability  reliability of supply and customer service 
as a result  lyondell generally is not able to protect its market position for these products by product differentiation and may not be able to pass on cost increases to its customers 
accordingly  increases in raw material and other costs may not necessarily correlate with changes in prices for these products  either in the direction of the price change or in magnitude 
in addition  lyondell s ability to increase product sales prices  and the timing of those increases  are affected by the supply demand balances for its products  as well as the capacity utilization rates for those products 
timing differences in pricing between rising raw material costs  which may change daily  and contract product prices  which in many cases are negotiated only monthly or less often  sometimes with an additional lag in effective dates for increases  have reduced and may continue to reduce profitability 
environmental and other regulatory matters lyondell and lcr cannot predict with certainty the extent of future liabilities and costs under environmental  health and safety laws and regulations and whether liabilities and costs will be material 
in addition  lyondell and lcr may face liability for alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances at their facilities or chemicals that they otherwise manufacture  handle or own 
although these types of claims have not historically had a material impact on their operations  a substantial increase in the success of these types of claims could result in the expenditure of a significant amount of cash by lyondell or lcr to pay claims  and could reduce their operating results 
lyondell and lcr together with the industries in which they operate are subject to extensive national  state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning  and are required to have permits and licenses 
table of contents regulating  emissions to the air  discharges onto land or waters and the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of waste materials 
many of these laws and regulations provide for substantial fines and potential criminal sanctions for violations 
some of these laws and regulations are subject to varying and conflicting interpretations 
in addition  some of these laws and regulations require lyondell and lcr to meet specific financial responsibility requirements 
the company cannot accurately predict future developments  such as increasingly strict environmental laws  and inspection and enforcement policies  as well as higher compliance costs  which might affect the handling  manufacture  use  emission or disposal of products  other materials or hazardous and non hazardous waste 
some risk of environmental costs and liabilities is inherent in lyondell s and lcr s operations and products  as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses  and there is no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred 
in general  however  with respect to the costs and risks described above  lyondell does not expect that it or lcr will be affected differently than the rest of the chemicals and refining industries where their facilities are located 
environmental laws may have a significant effect on the nature and scope of cleanup of contamination at current and former operating facilities  the costs of transportation and storage of raw materials and finished products and the costs of the storage and disposal of wastewater 
also  us superfund statutes may impose joint and several liability for the costs of remedial investigations and actions on the entities that generated waste  arranged for disposal of the wastes  transported to or selected the disposal sites and the past and present owners and operators of such sites 
all such responsible parties or any one of them  including lyondell and lcr may be required to bear all of such costs regardless of fault  legality of the original disposal or ownership of the disposal site 
in addition  similar environmental laws and regulations that have been or may be enacted in countries outside of the us may impose similar liabilities and costs upon the company 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental matters 
the company and lcr have on site solid waste management units at several facilities 
it is anticipated that corrective measures will be necessary to comply with federal and state requirements with respect to these facilities 
the company and lcr also have liabilities under the resource conservation and recovery act and various state and non us government regulations related to several current and former plant sites 
the company and lcr also are responsible for a portion of the remediation of certain off site waste disposal facilities 
the company and lcr are contributing funds to the cleanup of several waste sites throughout the us under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla and the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of the company and lcr also have been named as potentially responsible parties at several other sites 
the company s policy is to accrue remediation expenses when it is probable that such efforts will be required and the related expenses can be reasonably estimated 
estimated costs for future environmental compliance and remediation are necessarily imprecise due to such factors as the continuing evolution of environmental laws and regulatory requirements  the availability and application of technology  the identification of presently unknown remediation sites and the allocation of costs among the potentially responsible parties under applicable statutes 
the company  to the extent appropriate  has accrued amounts without regard to potential insurance recoveries or other third party reimbursements believed to be sufficient to cover current estimates of the cost for remedial measures based upon its interpretation of current environmental standards 
in the opinion of management  there is no material estimable range of reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount recorded 
based on the establishment of such accruals  and the status of discussions with regulatory agencies  the company does not anticipate any material adverse effect upon its financial position or liquidity or competitive position as a result of compliance with the laws and regulations described in this or the preceding paragraphs

in some cases  compliance with environmental  health and safety laws and regulations can only be achieved by capital expenditures 
in the years ended december   and  the company  including equistar and millennium for december  spent approximately million  million and million  respectively  
table of contents for environmentally related capital expenditures at existing facilities 
capital expenditures by lcr on a basis for regulatory compliance were million  million and million in the same periods 
the increased capital expenditures resulted from new emission reduction rules  as discussed below 
prior to lyondell s november  acquisition of millennium  equistar and millennium were not consolidated subsidiaries of lyondell 
on a separate company basis  in the years ended december   and  equistar spent approximately million  million and million  respectively  and millennium spent approximately million  million and million  respectively  for environmentally related capital expenditures at existing facilities 
the company currently estimates that environmentally related capital expenditures at its facilities including equistar and millennium facilities will be approximately million for and million for these amounts include estimated expenditures related to emission control standards for nitrogen oxides nox and highly reactive  volatile organic compounds hrvocs  and a wastewater management project 
environmentally related capital expenditures at lcr s facilities on a basis are estimated to be approximately million in and million in the expected increase in environmental spending at lcr s facilities reflects spending for low sulfur fuels regulations  as well as emission reductions 
kalamazoo river superfund site lyondell acquired millennium on november  a millennium subsidiary  which is now a subsidiary of lyondell  has been identified as a potential responsible party prp with respect to the kalamazoo river superfund site 
the site involves cleanup of river sediments and floodplain soils contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs  cleanup of former paper mill operations  and cleanup and closure of landfills associated with the former paper mill operations 
litigation concerning the matter commenced in december but was subsequently stayed and is being addressed under cercla 
in  the kalamazoo river study group the krsg  of which the millennium subsidiary and other prps are members  submitted to the state of michigan a draft remedial investigation and draft feasibility study  which evaluated a number of remedial options for the river 
the estimated costs for these remedial options ranged from to billion 
at the end of  the us environmental protection agency epa took lead responsibility for the river portion of the site at the request of the state of michigan 
in  the epa initiated a confidential process to facilitate discussions among the agency  the millennium subsidiary  other prps  the michigan departments of environmental quality and natural resources  and certain federal natural resource trustees about the need for additional investigation activities and different possible approaches for addressing the contamination in and along the kalamazoo river 
as of december   the probable liability associated with the river cannot be determined with certainty 
a liability of million has been recognized  representing millennium s interim allocation of of the million estimated cost of bank stabilization  recommended as the preferred remedy in by the krsg 
although the krsg study identified a broad range of remedial options  not all of those options would represent reasonably possible outcomes 
management does not believe that it can identify a single remedy among those options that would represent the highest cost reasonably possible outcome 
in addition  lyondell has recognized a liability of million primarily related to millennium s estimated share of remediation costs for two former paper mill sites and associated landfills  which are also part of the kalamazoo river superfund site 
although no final agreement has been reached as to the ultimate remedy for these locations  millennium has begun remediation activity related to these sites 
millennium s ultimate liability for the kalamazoo river superfund site will depend on many factors that have not yet been determined  including the ultimate remedy selected  the determination of natural resource damages  the number and financial viability of the other prps  and the determination of the final allocation among the prps

table of contents ozone standard the eight county houston galveston region has been designated a severe non attainment area for ozone by the epa under a one hour ozone standard 
emission reduction controls for nox  which contribute to ozone formation  must be installed at lcr s refinery and each of lyondell s ten facilities in the houston galveston region prior to a november compliance deadline for the one hour ozone standard 
in addition  in december  the regulatory agency for the state of texas  the texas commission on environmental quality  or tceq  finalized controls over hrvocs 
lyondell and lcr are still assessing the impact of the hrvoc rules 
in april  the epa designated the eight county houston galveston region a moderate non attainment area under an eight hour ozone standard 
as a result  the tceq must submit a plan to the epa in to demonstrate compliance with the eight hour ozone standard in although the one hour ozone standard expires in  the controls under that standard will not be relaxed under the epa s new eight hour transition rules 
as a result  lyondell and lcr still will be required to meet the new emission standards for nox and hrvocs 
the timing and amount of the estimated expenditures are subject to these regulatory and other uncertainties  as well as to obtaining the necessary permits and approvals 
the ultimate cost of implementing any plan developed to comply with the final ozone standards cannot be estimated at this time

mtbe in the united states  the clean air act amendments of set minimum levels for oxygenates  such as mtbe  in gasoline sold in areas not meeting specified air quality standards 
however  the presence of mtbe in some water supplies in california and other states due to gasoline leaking from underground storage tanks and in surface water from recreational water craft has led to public concern about the use of mtbe 
certain us states have banned the use of mtbe  while other us federal and state governmental initiatives have sought either to rescind the oxygen requirement for reformulated gasoline or to restrict or also ban the use of mtbe 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and the results of operations environmental matters for further discussion regarding these us federal and state initiatives and their potential impact on lyondell  including potential capital expenditures required for lyondell to produce alternative gasoline blending components 
gasoline and diesel fuel standards the clean air act specified certain emissions standards for vehicles and  in  the epa concluded that additional controls on gasoline and diesel fuel were necessary 
new standards for gasoline were finalized in and required refiners to produce a lower sulfur gasoline by  with final compliance by a new on road diesel standard was adopted in january and will require refiners of on road diesel fuel to produce as ultra low sulfur diesel ulsd by june  and by the end of  with less stringent standards for off road diesel fuel 
to date  the off road diesel fuel standards have not been finalized 
these gasoline and diesel fuel standards will result in increased capital investment for lcr 
in addition  these standards could result in higher operating costs for lcr 
lyondell s business may also be impacted if these standards increase the cost for processing fuel components 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and the results of operations environmental matters for a summary of the estimated capital expenditures required for lcr to comply with these standards 
other regulatory requirements in addition to the environmental matters described above  lyondell and lcr are subject to other material regulatory requirements  including those relating to the shipment or exportation of products 
although lyondell and lcr have compliance programs and other processes intended to ensure compliance with all such regulations  lyondell and lcr are subject to the risk that their compliance with such regulations could be challenged 
non compliance with certain of these regulations could result in the incurrence of additional costs  penalties or assessments that could be significant 
lead paint together with alleged past manufacturers of lead based paint and lead pigments for use in paint  lyondell s millennium subsidiary has been named as a defendant in various legal proceedings alleging that millennium and other manufacturers are responsible for personal injury  property damage  and remediation costs allegedly associated with the use of these products 
the plaintiffs in these legal proceedings include municipalities  counties  school districts  individuals and the state of rhode island  and seek recovery under a 
table of contents variety of theories  including negligence  failure to warn  breach of warranty  conspiracy  market share liability  fraud  misrepresentation and nuisance 
the majority of these legal proceedings assert unspecified monetary damages in excess of the statutory minimum and  in certain cases  contain general language requesting equitable relief from defendants such as abatement of lead based paint in buildings 
all these legal proceedings are in various pre trial  post trial and post dismissal settings  some of which are on appeal 
one legal proceeding relating to lead pigment or paint was tried in on october   the judge in that case declared a mistrial after the jury declared itself deadlocked 
the sole issue before the jury was whether lead pigment in paint in and on rhode island buildings constituted a public nuisance 
this case is tentatively set to be retried on september  an order is anticipated from the court specifying the additional issues to be considered by the jury in the retrial beyond the public nuisance questions considered by the jury in the first trial 
while lyondell believes that millennium has valid defenses to all the lead based paint and lead pigment proceedings and is vigorously defending them  litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties 
additional lead based paint and lead pigment litigation may be filed against millennium in the future asserting similar or different legal theories and seeking similar or different types of damages and relief  and any adverse court rulings or determinations of liability  among other factors  could affect this litigation by encouraging an increase in the number of future claims and proceedings 
in addition  from time to time  legislation and administrative regulations have been enacted or proposed to impose obligations on present and former manufacturers of lead based paint and lead pigment respecting asserted health concerns associated with such products or to overturn successful court decisions 
lyondell is unable to predict the outcome of lead based paint and lead pigment litigation  the number or nature of possible future claims and proceedings  and the effect that any legislation and or administrative regulations may have on millennium and  therefore  lyondell 
in addition  lyondell cannot reasonably estimate the scope or amount of the costs and potential liabilities related to such litigation  or any such legislation and regulations 
thus  any liability millennium incurs with respect to pending or future lead based paint or lead pigment litigation  or any legislation or regulations could  to the extent not covered by insurance  have a material impact on millennium s and  therefore  lyondell s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  lyondell has not accrued any liabilities for judgments or settlements against millennium resulting from lead based paint and lead pigment litigation 
see item legal proceedings 
operating hazards the occurrence of material operating problems at facilities owned by lyondell and lcr  including  but not limited to  the events described below  may materially reduce the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility  or the company as a whole  during and after the period of such operational difficulties 
the company s operating results are dependent on the continued operation of its and lcr s various production facilities and the ability to complete construction projects on schedule 
although the company and lcr take precautions to enhance the safety of their operations and minimize the risk of disruptions  their operations  along with the operations of other members of the chemical and refining industries  are subject to hazards inherent in chemical manufacturing and refining and the related storage and transportation of raw materials  products and wastes 
these hazards include pipeline leaks and ruptures  explosions  fires  severe weather and natural disasters  mechanical failure  unscheduled downtimes  supplier disruptions  labor difficulties  transportation interruptions  remediation complications  chemical spills  discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases  storage tank leaks  other environmental risks  and potential terrorist acts 
some of these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage  and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties 
furthermore  the company and lcr will also continue to be subject to present and future claims with respect to workplace exposure  workers compensation and other matters 
the company and lcr maintain property  business interruption and casualty insurance that they believe are in accordance with customary industry practices  but they are not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to their businesses  including losses resulting from war risks or terrorist acts 
as a result of market conditions  premiums and 
table of contents deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and  in some instances  certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage 
if the company or lcr were to incur a significant liability for which they were not fully insured  that company might not be able to finance the amount of the uninsured liability on terms acceptable to it or at all  and might be obligated to divert a significant portion of its cash flow from normal business operations 
joint venture risks a portion of the company s operations is conducted through joint ventures 
the company shares control of these joint ventures with third parties 
the company s forecasts and plans with respect to these joint ventures assume that its joint venture partners will observe their joint venture obligations 
in the event that any of the company s joint venture partners do not observe their joint venture obligations  it is possible that the affected joint venture would not be able to operate in accordance with its business plans or that the company would be required to increase its level of commitment in order to give effect to such plans 
as with any such joint venture arrangements  differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major matters  potentially adversely affecting the business and operations of the joint ventures and in turn the business and operations of the company 
lyondell or any of the other owners of the joint ventures may transfer control of their joint venture interests or engage in mergers or other business combination transactions that could result in a change in control of lyondell or the joint venture or the other owner 
in many instances  such a transfer would be subject to an obligation to first offer the other owner an opportunity to purchase the interest 
lyondell and the other joint venture owners have discussed  and from time to time may continue to discuss  in connection with their ordinary course dialog regarding the joint ventures or otherwise  transactions that could result in a transfer or modification  directly or indirectly  of their ownership in a joint venture 
lyondell cannot be certain that any of the joint venture owners will not sell  transfer or otherwise modify their ownership interest in a joint venture  whether in a transaction involving third parties and or the other owner 
lcr s credit facility provides that an event of default occurs if lyondell and citgo cease to individually or collectively hold at least a interest in lcr 
in addition  lcr s credit facility provides that an event of default occurs if lyondell transfers its interest as a member of lcr to a person other than an affiliate or neither citgo nor any of its affiliates is a member of lcr 
limitations on transfers of cash between lyondell  millennium  equistar and lcr although equistar and millennium are wholly owned subsidiaries of lyondell  debt covenants limit the ability to transfer cash among lyondell  equistar and millennium 
debt covenants also limit transfers of cash between lyondell and lcr 
one of millennium s indentures currently prevents it from paying dividends to lcc 
this prohibition will continue unless and until millennium s cumulative earnings and its fixed charge coverage ratio reach specified levels 
accordingly  cash flow of millennium currently is not  and in the future may not be  available to lcc to fund lcc s needs  such as servicing lcc s debt  paying its capital expenditures or paying dividends to its shareholders 
lcc s indentures contain a covenant that currently prohibits it from making cash investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures which are not restricted subsidiaries as defined in the indentures  subject to only limited exceptions 
neither millennium nor equistar currently is a restricted subsidiary 
lyondell s flexibility to make investments in lcr  and millennium s flexibility to make investments in equistar  also continue to be limited by other tests 
future borrowings also may contain restrictions on making cash investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures 

table of contents some of equistar s indentures require additional interest payments to the noteholders if equistar makes distributions to lyondell and millennium when equistar does not meet a specified fixed charge coverage ratio 
equistar met this ratio as of december  in addition  equistar s credit facility and lcr s credit facility prohibit the payment of distributions during any default under their respective facilities 
these provisions may deter or limit the movement of cash from equistar to lyondell and millennium and from lcr to lyondell 
future borrowings by lyondell s subsidiaries and joint ventures also may contain restrictions on the payment of distributions by such subsidiaries and joint ventures to lyondell 
applicable state law may also limit the amounts they are permitted to pay as distributions on their equity interests 
the ability of lyondell s subsidiaries and joint ventures to distribute cash to lyondell also is dependent upon their economic performance  which is dependent on a variety of factors  including factors described elsewhere in this risks and other factors that may affect lyondell  its subsidiaries and its joint ventures section 
potential acquisitions  divestitures and joint ventures lyondell continuously seeks opportunities to generate value through business combinations  purchases and sales of assets and contractual arrangements or joint ventures 
these transactions are intended to result in the realization of synergies  the creation of efficiencies or the generation of cash to reduce debt 
these transactions may be financed by the issuance of equity securities or  to the extent permitted by applicable debt covenants  additional borrowings by lyondell  its subsidiaries or joint ventures 
although these transactions are expected to yield longer term benefits if the expected efficiencies and synergies of the transactions are realized  they could reduce lyondell s operating results in the short term because of the costs associated with such transactions 
other transactions may advance future cash flows from some of lyondell s businesses  thereby yielding increased short term liquidity  but consequently resulting in lower cash flows from these operations over the longer term

forward looking statements can be identified by words such as estimate  believe  expect  anticipate  plan  budget or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes 
many of these forward looking statements have been based on expectations and assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate 
while management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable  they are inherently subject to significant business  economic  competitive  regulatory and other risks  contingencies and uncertainties  most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond lyondell s control

table of contents industry and other information the data included or incorporated by reference in this report regarding the chemical industry  product capacity and ranking  including lyondell s capacity positions and the capacity positions of its competitors for certain products  is based on independent industry publications  reports from government agencies or other published industry sources and lyondell s estimates 
these estimates are based on information obtained from customers  distributors  suppliers  trade and business organizations and other contacts in the markets in which lyondell operates and managements knowledge and experience

non gaap financial measures the body of generally accepted accounting principles is commonly referred to as gaap 
for this purpose  a non gaap financial measure is generally defined by the securities and exchange commission as one that purports to measure historical or future financial performance  financial position or cash flows but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable us gaap measure 
from time to time lyondell discloses so called non gaap financial measures  primarily ebitda  or earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation and amortization of long lived assets  as well as proportionate share data for lyondell and its joint ventures 
the non gaap financial measures described herein or in other documents issued by lyondell are not a substitute for the gaap measures of earnings  for which management has responsibility 
lyondell sometimes uses ebitda in its communications with investors  financial analysts and the public 
this is because ebitda is perceived as a useful and comparable measure of operating performance and liquidity 
for example  interest expense is dependent on the capital structure and credit rating of a company 
however  debt levels  credit ratings and  therefore  the impact of interest expense on earnings vary in significance between companies 
similarly  the tax positions of individual companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits  with the result that their effective tax rates and tax expense can vary considerably 
finally  companies differ in the age and method of acquisition of productive assets  and thus the relative costs of those assets  as well as in the depreciation straight line  accelerated  units of production method  which can result in considerable variability in depreciation and amortization expense between companies 
thus  for comparison purposes  management believes that ebitda can be useful as an objective and comparable measure of operating profitability and the contribution of operations to liquidity because it excludes these elements of earnings that do not provide information about the current operations of existing assets 
accordingly  management believes that disclosure of ebitda can provide useful information to investors  financial analysts and the public in their evaluation of companies operating performance and the contribution of operations to liquidity 
lyondell also periodically reports adjusted net income loss or adjusted ebitda  excluding specified items that are unusual in nature or are not comparable from period to period and that are included in gaap measures of earnings 
management believes that excluding these items generally helps investors compare operating performance between two periods 
such adjusted data is always reported with an explanation of the items that are excluded 
lyondell also reports certain proportionate share data for lyondell and its joint ventures that are not consolidated  but are accounted for by the equity method of accounting 
accordingly  in lyondell s financial statements investors only see a single line item investments for the unconsolidated joint ventures in the balance sheet and one line item equity income from joint venture investments in the income statement 
therefore  investors may not get a complete appreciation of the magnitude of certain operating and financial measures for lyondell and its unconsolidated joint ventures and the scope of their business activities 

table of contents management believes that reporting certain proportionate share data may give investors a more complete picture of the size and scope of the operating activities of lyondell and its joint ventures 
item legal proceedings litigation matters the company  its subsidiaries and its joint ventures are  from time to time  defendants in lawsuits  some of which are not covered by insurance 
many of these suits make no specific claim for relief 
although final determination of legal liability and the resulting financial impact with respect to any such litigation cannot be ascertained with any degree of certainty  the company does not believe that any ultimate uninsured liability resulting from the legal proceedings in which it  its subsidiaries or its joint ventures currently are involved directly or indirectly will individually  or in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on the business or financial condition of the company 
however  the adverse resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these suits could have a material impact on lyondell s results of operations for that period  which may be mitigated by contribution or indemnification obligations of co defendants or others  or by any insurance coverage that may be available 
although lyondell  its subsidiaries and its joint ventures are involved in numerous and varied legal proceedings  a significant portion of their outstanding litigation arose in five contexts claims for personal injury or death allegedly arising out of exposure to the products produced by or located on the premises of the respective entities  claims for personal injury or death  and or property damage allegedly arising out of the generation and disposal of chemical wastes at superfund and other waste disposal sites  claims for personal injury  property damage and or air  noise and water pollution allegedly arising out of operations  employment and benefits related claims  and commercial disputes 
millennium lyondell s millennium subsidiary has received requests from the staff of the northeast regional office of the securities and exchange commission for the voluntary production of documents in connection with an informal inquiry into the previously disclosed restatement of millennium s financial statements for the years through and for the first quarter of millennium is complying with all such requests received 
together with alleged past manufacturers of lead based paint and lead pigments for use in paint  millennium has been named as a defendant in various legal proceedings alleging that millennium and other manufacturers are responsible for personal injury  property damage  and remediation costs allegedly associated with the use of these products 
the plaintiffs in these legal proceedings include municipalities  counties  school districts  individuals and the state of rhode island  and seek recovery under a variety of theories  including negligence  failure to warn  breach of warranty  conspiracy  market share liability  fraud  misrepresentation and nuisance 
the majority of these legal proceedings assert unspecified monetary damages in excess of the statutory minimum and  in certain cases  contain general language requesting equitable relief from defendants such as abatement of lead based paint in buildings

table of contents millennium s defense costs to date for lead based paint and lead pigment litigation largely have been covered by insurance 
millennium has not accrued any liabilities for any lead based paint and lead pigment litigation 
millennium has insurance policies that potentially provide approximately billion in indemnity coverage for lead based paint and lead pigment litigation 
millennium s ability to collect under the indemnity coverage would depend upon the timing of any request for indemnity and the solvency of the various insurance carriers that are part of the coverage block at the time of such a request 
as a result of insurance coverage litigation initiated by millennium  an ohio trial court issued a decision in effectively requiring certain insurance carriers to resume paying defense costs in the lead based paint and lead pigment cases 
indemnity coverage was not at issue in the ohio court s decision 
the insurance carriers may appeal the ohio decision regarding defense costs  and they have in the past and may in the future attempt to deny indemnity coverage if there is ever a settlement or an adverse judgment in any lead based paint or lead pigment case 
in  a predecessor of a company that is now a subsidiary of millennium sold its recently acquired glidden paints business 
as part of that sale  the seller agreed to indemnify the purchaser against certain claims made during the first eight years after the sale  the purchaser agreed to indemnify the seller against such claims made after the eight year period 
with the exception of the two cases discussed below  all pending lead based paint and lead pigment litigation involving millennium and its subsidiaries  including the rhode island case  was filed after the eight year period 
accordingly  millennium believes that it is entitled to full indemnification from the purchaser against lead based paint and lead pigment cases filed after the eight year period 
the purchaser disputes that it has such an indemnification obligation  and claims that the seller must indemnify it 
since millennium s defense costs to date largely have been covered by insurance and there never has been a settlement paid by  nor any judgment rendered against  millennium or any other company sued in any lead based paint or lead pigment litigation  the parties indemnification claims have not been ruled on by a court 
a current subsidiary and an alleged predecessor company are parties to the only two remaining cases originally filed within the eight year period following the sale of the glidden paints business referred to above 
in the first of these cases  the city of new york et al 
v 
lead industries association  inc  et al  commenced in the supreme court of the state of new york on june   the new york city housing authority brought an action relating to tens of thousands of public housing units 
all claims in that case have been dropped except for those relating to two housing projects 
the other remaining case  jackson  et al 
v 
the glidden co  et al  commenced in the court of common pleas  cuyahoga county  ohio  on august   includes two minors as plaintiffs 
dispositive motions were filed in that case in late and have yet to be ruled on by the court 
millennium believes that it has valid defenses to all pending lead based paint and lead pigment proceedings and is vigorously defending them 
however  litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties 
additional lead based paint and lead pigment litigation may be filed against millennium or its subsidiaries in the future asserting similar or different legal theories and seeking similar or different types of damages and relief  and any adverse court rulings or determinations of liability  among other factors  could affect the litigation by encouraging an increase in the number of future claims and proceedings 
in addition  from time to time  legislation and administrative regulations have been enacted or proposed to impose obligations on present and former manufacturers of lead based paint and lead pigment respecting asserted health concerns associated with such products or to overturn successful court decisions 
millennium is unable to predict the outcome of lead based paint and lead pigment litigation  the number or nature of possible future claims and proceedings  or the effect that any legislation and or administrative regulations may have on millennium or its subsidiaries 
in addition  management cannot reasonably estimate the scope or amount of the costs and potential liabilities related to such litigation  or any such legislation and regulations 
accordingly  millennium has not accrued any amounts for such litigation 
lcr on february   lcr filed a lawsuit against pdvsa and pdvsa oil in the united states district court  southern district of new york in connection with various force majeure declarations since april in the lawsuit  lcr alleges that the force majeure declarations by pdvsa and pdvsa oil are invalid and 
table of contents that pdvsa and pdvsa oil have breached the contracts related to the delivery of crude oil by pdvsa and pdvsa oil to lcr 
lcr is seeking monetary damages of at least million resulting from pdvsa oil s failure to pay lcr the amounts required by contract relating to past crude oil deliveries of less than the contractual amount 
lcr also is seeking declaratory relief relating to the force majeure declarations  and is seeking a declaratory interpretation of the disputed contract provisions in order to clarify the rights and obligations of the parties for the remaining duration of the contracts  which expire in december on may   the defendants filed a motion to dismiss lcr s complaint on the ground that the act of state doctrine prevented the court from deciding lcr s breach of contract claims 
on august   the court denied the defendants motion to dismiss lcr s claims based on the act of state doctrine 
both parties filed motions for summary judgment during november environmental proceedings from time to time the company  its subsidiaries and its joint ventures receive notices from federal  state or local governmental entities of alleged violations of environmental laws and regulations pertaining to  among other things  the disposal  emission and storage of chemical and petroleum substances  including hazardous wastes 
such alleged violations may become the subject of enforcement actions or other legal proceedings and may individually or in the aggregate involve monetary sanctions of  or more exclusive of interest and costs

as of december   the environmental liability for lyondell and its subsidiaries including equistar and millennium for future remediation costs at all current and former plant sites and superfund sites totaled million 
the liabilities for individual sites range from million to million and are expected to be incurred over a number of years  and not be concentrated in any single year 
in the opinion of management  there is no material estimable range of reasonably possible loss in excess of the liabilities recorded for environmental remediation 
however  it is possible that new information about the sites for which the accrual has been established  new technology or future developments such as involvement in investigations by regulatory agencies  could require the company to reassess its potential exposure related to environmental matters

equistar in april  the illinois attorney general s office filed a complaint in grundy county  illinois circuit court seeking monetary sanctions for releases into the environment at millennium s morris  illinois plant in alleged violation of state regulations 
the morris  illinois plant was contributed to equistar on december  in connection with the formation of equistar 
equistar has reached a settlement with the state of illinois  which includes a civil penalty in the amount of  in may  the tceq notified equistar that it is seeking a civil penalty of  in connection with alleged exceedances of permitted emissions at certain cooling towers at equistar s channelview plant 
equistar does not believe that the ultimate resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on the business or financial condition of equistar 
millennium lyondell acquired millennium on november  a millennium subsidiary  which is now a subsidiary of lyondell  has been identified as a prp with respect to the kalamazoo river superfund site 
the site involves cleanup of river sediments and floodplain soils contaminated with pcbs  cleanup of former paper mill operations  and cleanup and closure of landfills associated with the former paper mill operations 
litigation concerning the matter commenced in december but was subsequently stayed and is being addressed under cercla 
in  the krsg  of which the millennium subsidiary and other prps are 
table of contents members  submitted to the state of michigan a draft remedial investigation and draft feasibility study  which evaluated a number of remedial options for the river 
the estimated costs for these remedial options ranged from to billion 
as of december   the probable liability associated with the river cannot be determined with certainty 
a liability of million has been recognized  representing millennium s interim allocation of of the million estimated cost of bank stabilization  recommended as the preferred remedy in by the krsg 
although the krsg study identified a broad range of remedial options  not all of those options would represent reasonably possible outcomes 
management does not believe that it can identify a single remedy among those options that would represent the highest cost reasonably possible outcome 
in addition  lyondell has recognized a liability of million primarily related to millennium s estimated share of remediation costs for two former paper mill sites and associated landfills  which are also part of the kalamazoo river superfund site 
although no final agreement has been reached as to the ultimate remedy for these locations  millennium has begun remediation activity related to these sites 
millennium s ultimate liability for the kalamazoo river superfund site will depend on many factors that have not yet been determined  including the ultimate remedy selected  the determination of natural resource damages  the number and financial viability of the other prps  and the determination of the final allocation among the prps 
for additional information regarding the kalamazoo river superfund site  see risks and other factors that may affect lyondell  its subsidiaries and its joint ventures environmental and other regulatory matters 
indemnification lyondell  its subsidiaries and its joint ventures are parties to various indemnification arrangements  including arrangements entered into in connection with acquisitions  divestitures and the formation of joint ventures 
for example  lyondell entered into indemnification arrangements in connection with the transfer of assets and liabilities from arco to lyondell prior to lyondell s initial public offering  in connection with lyondell s acquisition of the outstanding shares of arco chemical company and in connection with the formation of lcr  equistar and its owner companies including lyondell and millennium entered into indemnification arrangements in connection with the formation of equistar  and millennium entered into indemnification arrangements in connection with its demerger from hanson plc 
pursuant to these arrangements  lyondell  its subsidiaries and its joint ventures provide indemnification to and or receive indemnification from other parties in connection with liabilities that may arise in connection with the transactions and in connection with activities prior to completion of the transactions 
these indemnification arrangements typically include provisions pertaining to third party claims relating to environmental and tax matters and various types of litigation 
as of december   lyondell has not accrued any significant amounts for such indemnification obligations  other than amounts under tax sharing agreements that have been reflected in the provision for income taxes  and is not aware of other circumstances that would be likely to lead to significant future indemnification claims against lyondell 
lyondell cannot determine with certainty the potential amount of future payments under the indemnification arrangements until events arise that would trigger a liability under the arrangements

overview general lyondell is a global chemical company that manufactures and markets a variety of basic chemicals and gasoline blending components 
as a result of its acquisition of millennium chemicals inc millennium on november  and lyondell s resulting ownership of millennium and equistar chemicals  lp equistar  the operations of millennium and equistar are included in lyondell s consolidated financial statements prospectively from december  lyondell s operations primarily comprise the ethylene  co products and derivatives ec d segment  the propylene oxide and related products po rp segment  the inorganic chemicals segment and the refining segment  consisting of lyondell s equity investment in lyondell citgo refining lp lcr  a joint venture with citgo petroleum corporation citgo 
prior to the acquisition of millennium  lyondell held an equity investment of in equistar  a joint venture with millennium 
during  the chemical industry experienced broad based improvements as a stronger global economy led to increased demand and tighter chemical industry supply demand balances compared to in this improved business environment  the industry experienced higher sales volumes and generally higher product margins in compared to lyondell  through its investment in equistar  was able to implement sales price increases for ethylene and derivatives that more than offset the effect of significantly higher raw material and energy costs 
in addition  lyondell was able to implement significant sales price increases for ethylene co products such as propylene  benzene and fuels 
the higher raw material and energy costs in and reflected the effect of a significant escalation in crude oil prices and ongoing high natural gas prices compared to lyondell also was able to implement sales price increases for propylene oxide po and derivatives that more than offset the effect of significant increases in the price of propylene  a key po raw material  resulting in higher product margins compared to in addition  a stronger domestic gasoline market in resulted in higher margins for methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe and other fuel based products compared to in  lcr s refining operations benefited from higher margins on crude oil refining  stronger aromatics markets and higher processing rates for venezuelan heavy  high sulfur crude oil compared to the stronger domestic gasoline and diesel markets in resulted in higher product margins for lcr 
benchmark crude oil and natural gas prices generally have been indicators of the level and direction of movement of raw material and energy costs for the ec d segment 
ethylene and its co products are produced from two major raw material groups crude oil based liquids liquids or heavy liquids  including naphthas  condensates  and gas oils  the prices of which are generally related to crude oil prices  and 
table of contents natural gas liquids ngls  principally ethane and propane  the prices of which are generally affected by natural gas prices 
lyondell has the ability to shift its ratio of raw materials used in the production of ethylene and co products to take advantage of the relative costs of liquids and ngls 
the following table shows the average benchmark prices for crude oil and natural gas for the applicable three year period  as well as benchmark sales prices for ethylene and propylene  which lyondell produces and sells 
propylene is also a key raw material for lyondell s po rp business segment 
the benchmark weighted average cost of ethylene production is based on cmai s estimated ratio of crude oil based liquid raw materials and ngls used in us ethylene production and is subject to revision 
see discussion of the ec d segment s operating results below for additional details 
average benchmark price for the year and percent change versus prior year average percent increase percent increase crude oil dollars per barrel natural gas dollars per million btus weighted average cost of ethylene production cents per pound ethylene cents per pound propylene cents per pound in and  as indicated in the above table  benchmark crude oil prices and natural gas prices continued at high levels  resulting in higher raw material and energy costs compared to in  compared to  the chemical industry experienced high and volatile raw material and energy costs  continuing weak demand and ongoing excess industry capacity 
these factors combined to put downward pressure on industry product margins and sales volumes during in addition  lyondell was negatively impacted in by the phase out  in several us states  of mtbe as an oxygenate in reformulated gasoline and the expiration of a favorable mtbe sales contract at the end of results of operations lyondell s wholly owned operations prior to the acquisition of millennium comprised the po rp segment 
as a result of the acquisition of millennium on november   lyondell s operating income for the month of december also includes operations of equistar and millennium as wholly owned subsidiaries  as discussed in the ec d and inorganic chemicals sections below

fourth quarter versus third quarter lyondell had net income of million in the fourth quarter compared to million in the third quarter the million decrease was primarily due to the million charge for purchased ipr d  a million after tax seasonal decrease in fourth quarter mtbe margins  and a million after tax increase in sg a expenses 
the higher sg a expenses resulted from the effect of lyondell s higher common stock price and improved lyondell and equistar performance on incentive compensation expense in the fourth quarter and the consolidation of equistar s and millennium s december sg a expenses  which totaled 
table of contents million after tax 
these decreases were partially offset by inclusion of of equistar s and millennium s net income for the month of december  which totaled million and was primarily due to equistar  and by higher product margins for po and derivatives  as well as by a reduction of the effective tax rate 
the improvement in equistar s results compared to the third quarter was primarily due to higher product margins 
segment analysis lyondell operates primarily in four reportable segments ec d  po rp  inorganic chemicals and refining 
lyondell s refining operations are conducted through its interest in lcr 
the ec d segment comprises the operations of equistar  which became a wholly owned subsidiary of lyondell with the november  acquisition of millennium  and the acetyls business of millennium 
the po rp segment represents the operations of the former intermediate chemicals and derivatives segment of lyondell  and the inorganic chemicals segment comprises millennium s titanium dioxide tio and related products business 
ethylene  co products and derivatives segment overview in its ec d segment  lyondell manufactures and markets ethylene and its co products  primarily propylene  butadiene and aromatics  which include benzene and toluene 
lyondell also manufactures and markets derivatives  primarily polyethylene including high density polyethylene hdpe  low density polyethylene ldpe and linear low density polyethylene lldpe  ethylene glycol  ethylene oxide and its derivatives  and ethanol and vinyl acetate monomer vam 
in the ec d segment  lyondell also manufactures and markets methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe  alkylate  acetic acid  methanol and polypropylene 
the manufacturing and marketing of vam  acetic acid and methanol collectively  acetyls are conducted by millennium and the manufacturing and marketing of the remaining ec d products are conducted by equistar 
millennium and equistar became wholly owned subsidiaries of lyondell on november  operations of the millennium acetyls business are included in the ec d segment prospectively from december  revenues and operating income of the acetyls business for the month of december were million and million  respectively 
the following is a review of equistar s operating results for the periods on a stand alone basis 
consequently  it excludes the acetyls business and any effect of lyondell s accounting for its acquisition of millennium and its resultant acquisition of equistar

the stronger global economy led to increased demand and tighter chemical industry supply demand balances in compared to us ethylene demand grew an estimated in compared to in this improved business environment  the industry experienced higher sales volumes and generally higher product margins in compared to equistar was able to implement sales price increases in many products that more than offset the effect of significantly higher raw material and energy costs during and the higher raw material and energy costs in and reflected the effect of a significant escalation in crude oil prices and ongoing high natural gas costs compared to the magnitude of price increases had a negative effect on product demand in  and contributed to equistar experiencing lower sales volumes in compared to for the year  us industry ethylene demand decreased slightly compared to in addition  equistar completed scheduled maintenance turnarounds at its two largest ethylene plants in 
table of contents the following table sets forth equistar s sales and other operating revenues  operating income and selected product sales volumes 
for the year ended december  millions of dollars sales and other operating revenues operating income loss volumes  in millions ethylene and derivatives pounds co products  non aromatic pounds aromatics gallons includes polyethylene volumes  in millions of pounds  of   and  in  and  respectively 
revenues equistar s revenues of  million in increased compared to revenues of  million in  reflecting higher average sales prices and volumes 
benchmark ethylene sales prices were higher in compared to benchmark benzene sales prices averaged higher and benchmark propylene sales prices averaged higher in compared to benchmark prices of hdpe averaged higher in than in ethylene and derivative sales volumes were higher in compared to revenues of  million in increased compared to revenues of  million in due to higher sales prices  partly offset by a decrease in sales volumes 
benchmark ethylene prices averaged higher in compared to in response to significant increases in the cost of ethylene production  while benchmark propylene sales prices averaged higher 
sales volumes were lower in compared to due to the negative effect of price increases on product demand and maintenance turnarounds noted above  as well as the sale of the polypropylene production facility in pasadena  texas in operating income equistar s operating income was million in compared to an operating loss of million in the improvement was primarily due to higher product margins and higher sales volumes in due to improved supply demand fundamentals compared to the effect of sales price increases in response to higher raw material and energy costs were generally more favorable in than in  resulting in higher average product margins in operating results in also were negatively impacted by scheduled maintenance turnarounds at two major ethylene plants  a million loss on the sale of the polypropylene plant and an million charge for the write off of a research and development r d facility for derivatives 
equistar had an operating loss of million in compared to an operating loss of million in the increased operating loss in compared to was due to the million loss on the sale of the polypropylene plant  the million charge for the write off of the r d facility and lower sales volumes due to the two scheduled maintenance turnarounds  partially offset by an increase in derivative product margins as higher average sales prices more than offset higher raw material costs 
the operating loss in included a million negative impact of certain fixed price natural gas and ngl purchase contracts entered into in early fourth quarter versus third quarter as noted  ec d operating income for the fourth quarter included of the december operating income of equistar and millennium s acetyls business 
millennium s acetyls operating income was million for the month of december the following discussion of trailing quarter comparisons of fourth quarter results to third quarter operating results relates to equistar s results on a stand alone basis 

table of contents equistar s fourth quarter net income was million compared to net income of million in the third quarter the million improvement primarily resulted from higher sales prices for ethylene and derivatives  which more than offset the higher raw material costs compared to the third quarter all ethylene based product prices increased during the fourth quarter in addition  ethylene and derivative sales volumes were higher compared to the third quarter benchmark crude prices averaged higher in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter  but this increase in raw material costs was offset by an increase in co product prices 
propylene oxide and related products segment overview the po rp segment produces and markets po  po derivatives  such as propylene glycol pg  propylene glycol ethers pge  and butanediol bdo  toluene diisocyanate tdi  styrene and methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe  the principal derivative of tertiary butyl alcohol tba 
sm and tba are co products of lyondell s two major po production processes  referred to as po sm and po tba 
operations in included the operations of the owned maasvlakte po sm plant  which began production in the fourth quarter as a result of improved supply demand balances in  sales price increases for po and derivatives more than offset the effect of significant increases in the price of propylene  resulting in higher product margins compared to in the us  the benchmark cost of propylene  a key raw material  averaged higher in than in during  mtbe sales prices and margins benefited from a strong gasoline market and high gasoline prices compared to partly offsetting these improvements  tdi and styrene product margins were lower in as sales price increases for these products failed to offset raw material cost increases 
in particular  benchmark prices for raw material benzene in the us were higher compared to  negatively affecting styrene margins 
in  compared to  po rp operating results were negatively impacted by the phase out  in several us states  of mtbe and the expiration of the favorable mtbe sales contract at the end of  as well as experiencing high and volatile raw material and energy costs and ongoing excess industry capacity 
the maasvlakte po sm plant incurred prestart up expenses during of approximately million  of which lyondell s share was million 
also in  lyondell completed a restructuring of its nihon oxirane joint venture in japan  including the sale of a interest in the joint venture to lyondell s partner for million  resulting in an million gain and reducing lyondell s remaining interest from to 
the following table sets forth the po rp segment s sales and other operating revenues  operating income  product sales volumes and average benchmark market prices for propylene 
for the year ended december  millions of dollars sales and other operating revenues operating income loss volumes  in millions po and derivatives pounds co products sm pounds mtbe and other tba derivatives gallons average benchmark raw material price propylene united states cents per pound europe euros per metric ton 
table of contents the above sales data include processing volumes and purchases for resale 
the purchases for resale reflected in the sales volumes  principally styrene  were substantially replaced in by production volumes from the maasvlakte po sm plant in the netherlands  which began production in the fourth quarter revenues po rp revenues of  million in increased compared to revenues of  million in the higher revenues were primarily due to higher average sales prices and higher product sales volumes 
sales volumes for po and derivatives were higher in  reflecting stronger demand compared to sales volumes for co product styrene were higher  while mtbe sales volumes were lower in compared to revenues of  million in increased from revenues of  million in due primarily to higher average sales prices and the foreign exchange effect of a weaker us dollar 
sales volumes for po and derivatives and styrene increased but were partly offset by lower mtbe volumes 
average sales prices in for most products were higher in response to the higher raw material and natural gas costs in sales volumes for po and derivatives increased  including bdo  deicers and pg  reflecting increased demand  a full year of production from the botlek bdo plant and more severe weather  which increased deicer demand 
these higher volumes were partly offset by lower tdi sales volumes 
sales volumes increased for styrene in compared to  as a result of increased us spot sales 
sales volumes for mtbe and other tba derivatives decreased on lower mtbe demand 
operating income the po rp segment had operating income of million in compared to an operating loss of million in the improvement was primarily due to higher product margins and sales volumes for po and derivatives and higher mtbe margins 
the higher product margins resulted from increases in sales prices for po and derivatives which more than offset the increase in propylene prices 
these increases in operating income were partly offset by lower product margins for styrene as well as the segment s share of higher sg a expenses 
the increase in sg a expenses was primarily due to the effect of lyondell s higher common stock price and improved performance on incentive compensation expense in the operating loss in of million compares to operating income in of million 
the million decrease in operating results was primarily due to lower mtbe margins and volumes and  to a lesser extent  lower volumes and margins for tdi 
these effects were partly offset by improved results for po and derivatives 
the lower mtbe margins and volumes reflected decreased mtbe demand  the expiration of the favorable mtbe sales contract and higher raw material and energy costs related to high natural gas costs in the us mtbe demand decreased as use of mtbe was phased out in certain key states 
higher po and derivatives sales volumes and prices more than offset the effect of higher operating costs  which were primarily due to higher us natural gas costs and the new botlek bdo plant 
fourth quarter versus third quarter the po rp segment had an operating loss of million in the fourth quarter compared to operating income of million in the third quarter the million decrease was primarily due to lower mtbe profitability by approximately million as margins followed typical seasonal trends and the effect of lyondell s higher common stock price and improved performance on its incentive compensation programs 
tdi results also decreased by approximately million as a result of increased costs and scheduled maintenance turnaround activity 
partially offsetting these decreases were improved results for po and derivatives  as product margins improved due to increased sales prices  and sales volumes increased  driven by seasonal aircraft deicer sales 
po and derivative sales volumes were higher in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter styrene operating results were relatively unchanged versus the third quarter inorganic chemicals segment lyondell s inorganic chemicals segment comprises the titanium dioxide tio and related products business of millennium  which became a wholly owned subsidiary of lyondell on november  this 
table of contents segment s operating results for the month of december are included in lyondell s consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  revenues of this segment for the month of december were million and operating income was million 
refining segment overview lyondell s activities in the refining segment are conducted through its interest in lcr  and the following discussion of lcr s operating results is on a basis 
lcr produces refined petroleum products  including gasoline  low sulfur diesel  jet fuel  aromatics and lubricants 
pdvsa petr leo  sa pdvsa oil supplies heavy  high sulfur venezuelan crude oil to lcr under a long term crude supply agreement crude supply agreement or csa see crude supply agreement section of note to the consolidated financial statements 
under the csa  lcr purchases  barrels per day of heavy  high sulfur crude oil  which constitutes approximately of its rated crude oil refining capacity of  barrels per day 
lcr generally purchases the balance of its crude oil requirements on the spot market 
profit margins on spot market crude oil tend to be more volatile than margins on csa crude oil 
csa crude oil processing rates were  barrels per day in compared to  barrels per day in during the early part of  a national strike in the bolivarian republic of venezuela venezuela  which began in early december  disrupted deliveries of csa crude oil to lcr  causing lcr to temporarily reduce operating rates 
as a result of the reduced csa crude oil deliveries  lcr purchased significant volumes of crude oil from alternate sources during january the crude oil from these alternate sources did not completely offset the financial impact of the reduced csa supplies from venezuela 
csa deliveries returned to contract levels  beginning in february  and lcr benefited from deliveries of csa crude oil at above contract volumes for the remainder of and in in  lcr benefited from higher csa and spot crude oil margins compared to the higher csa crude oil margins primarily reflected favorable effects in the csa contract formula  resulting from more efficient operations and natural gas prices 
the csa contract pricing formula reflects natural gas prices on a lagged basis and resulted in a more favorable effect on csa crude oil margins compared to the effect in the higher spot crude oil margins reflected the strong gasoline market and high gasoline prices in compared to lcr also benefited from higher aromatics margins in compared to improved aromatics margins reflected significant increases in prices  primarily in the third quarter in  csa crude oil deliveries were below the contract rate as pdvsa oil declared itself in a force majeure situation in january and  beginning in march  reduced deliveries under the csa 
csa deliveries were restored to contract levels in the third quarter during  lcr increased its use of crude oil purchased in the spot market to compensate for the lower csa deliveries 
lcr s csa crude oil processing rates averaged  barrels per day in 
table of contents the following table sets forth lcr s sales and other operating revenues  net income  sales volumes for refined products and crude processing rates for the periods indicated 
for the year ended december  millions of dollars sales and other operating revenues net income thousands of barrels per day refined products sales volumes gasoline diesel and heating oil jet fuel aromatics other refined products total refined products sales volumes crude processing rates crude supply agreement other crude oil total crude processing rates during  lcr developed an alternative approach to complying with a mandated low sulfur gasoline standard  which led to a reduction in overall estimated capital expenditures 
as a result  lcr recognized impairment of value of million of costs related to the project in revenues revenues for lcr were  million in   million in and  million in the increase in compared to was primarily due to higher average refined product sales prices  which were driven largely by significantly higher crude oil prices in crude processing rates averaged  barrels per day in  increasing from average rates of  barrels per day 
additionally  csa crude processing rates increased  barrels per day offset by a  barrel per day decrease in spot market crude processing rates 
revenues for increased compared to the increase was primarily due to higher sales prices for refined products 
average sales prices for refined products during were higher than in while total crude processing rates increased by only from to  this represented an increase in csa crude processing rates of  barrels per day offset by a  barrel per day decrease in spot market crude processing rates 
net income lcr s net income was million in  million in and million in the million improvement in compared to was primarily due to higher margins on both csa and spot crude oil volumes  higher aromatics margins and increased operating reliability and efficiency that led to higher operating rates and reduced costs in higher csa processing rates also contributed to the improvement 
lcr s net income included a million benefit related to a third party contract settlement  partly offset by a million charge for the write off of obsolete equipment 
in addition  lcr s net income in included the million charge related to the previously capitalized costs for the low sulfur gasoline project and a million charge related to personnel reductions 
the million increase in lcr s net income in compared to was due to the benefit from processing higher volumes of higher margin csa crude oil and higher product margins for aromatics and 
table of contents lubricants in these benefits were partially offset by the negative effect in of higher natural gas costs  the million charge related to the low sulfur gasoline project and the million charge related to personnel reductions 
fourth quarter versus third quarter lcr s net income was million in the fourth quarter compared to million in the third quarter the improvement was primarily driven by higher spot crude oil margins  as fourth quarter csa processing rates of  barrels per day were slightly lower than third quarter csa crude oil processing rates of  barrels per day 
financial condition the results of operations and cash flows of millennium and equistar for the month of december are included in lyondell s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  operating activities operating activities provided cash of million in compared to million in and million in in december  cash flows provided by operating activities of equistar were million  and cash flows used by operating activities of millennium were million 
the remaining increase of million in operating cash flow in primarily reflected improved operating results  including higher distributions of earnings from affiliates  which more than offset a net increase in the main components of working capital accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable 
lyondell received income tax refunds and settlements  which totaled million in and million in a net increase in the main components of working capital used cash of million in compared to a net decrease in that provided cash of million 
the net increase in was primarily due to higher accounts receivable balances  which reflected higher product sales prices and sales volumes compared to during the third quarter  lcc amended its accounts receivable sales facility  increasing it from million to million in response to the increase in receivables and the resulting effect on working capital requirements 
the outstanding amount of receivables sold under lyondell s accounts receivables sales facilities  including the million facility of lyondell s wholly owned subsidiary  equistar  was million as of december  lyondell s interest in equistar was accounted for using the equity method prior to november   and the reported million outstanding amount of receivables sold under lcc s million facility as of december  did not include the million sold under equistar s facility as of december  see off balance sheet arrangements below 
in consideration of discounts offered to certain customers for early payment for product  some receivable amounts were collected in december and november that otherwise would have been expected to be collected in january and december  respectively 
this included equistar receivables of million in december and million in november from occidental chemical corporation  a subsidiary of occidental petroleum corporation together with its subsidiaries and affiliates  collectively occidental 
the decrease in cash provided in compared to primarily reflected lower operating results and lower income tax refunds in compared to  partly offset by a net reduction in the main components of working capital receivables  inventory and payables 
investing activities investing activities provided cash of million in and used cash of million in and million in the cash provided by investing activities in reflected the acquisition of millennium  which resulted in the consolidation of millennium s and equistar s cash balances as of november   totaling million 
in december  investing activities for equistar used cash of million  and investing activities for millennium provided cash of million 

table of contents the use of cash in was primarily due to the purchase of the previously leased botlek bdo plant for million in the second quarter  partly offset by the receipt of million of proceeds from lyondell s sale of a interest in nihon oxirane in the first quarter the use of cash in primarily reflected the purchase of an additional equity interest in equistar 
the following table summarizes the  and capital expenditures of lyondell and its principal joint ventures  including lyondell s contributions to the us po joint venture and european po joint venture  as well as their capital budgets 
equistar s and millennium s capital expenditures for the month of december are included as part of lyondell s capital expenditures

there were no contributions to equistar during the periods 
lcr fourth quarter cash distributions were reduced because of uncertainties in cash flow stemming from the national strike in venezuela 
lcr resumed cash distributions in the first quarter in march  lyondell and its partner completed agreements related to their nihon oxirane joint venture based in japan 
as part of the agreements  lyondell sold a share in nihon oxirane to its partner in the venture for million  reducing lyondell s ownership interest to 
lyondell realized an million gain on the sale 
in august  lyondell increased its equity interest in equistar to by acquiring occidental s interest 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the acquisition of occidental s interest in august  lyondell issued series b common stock  warrants and a contingent right to occidental chemical holding corporation 
these transactions included concurrent payments between the parties of agreed amounts of approximately million 
the agreed amounts exchanged are included in cash used in investing activities and cash provided by financing activities 
financing activities financing activities used cash of million in and provided cash of million and million in and  respectively 
cash dividends of per share of common stock totaling million  million and million were paid in  and  respectively 
in  lcc prepaid million of the senior secured notes  series b  which mature in  as well as million in prepayment premiums 
also  in december  lcc called an additional million of the senior secured notes  series b  for prepayment  which were paid in january in december  lcc entered into an amended and restated credit facility 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
in october  lyondell sold million shares of common stock  including million shares purchased by occidental chemical holding corporation ochc 
lyondell used the net proceeds of approximately million to enhance liquidity and for general corporate purposes 
also in  net proceeds 
table of contents of million from issuance of senior secured notes were partially offset by repayments of million of term loans 
the net proceeds of million were used in the purchase of the previously leased botlek bdo facility 
in december  lcc issued million of senior secured notes due  using net proceeds  after discount and fees  of million to prepay million of the principal amount outstanding under term loan e of the credit facility and to pay a million prepayment premium 
in july  lcc issued million of senior secured notes due  using proceeds of million to prepay million of the principal amount of a term loan outstanding under the credit facility and to pay a million prepayment premium 
the remaining net proceeds of approximately million were used for general corporate purposes 
lyondell also issued million shares of common stock  receiving net proceeds of million that were used for general corporate purposes 
in august  lyondell completed certain transactions with ochc which included specified cash payments of million and issuance by lyondell of million shares of series b common stock and warrants to acquire five million shares of lyondell common stock 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the transactions with ochc  lyondell had two series of common stock outstanding until december  common stock and series b common stock 
lyondell elected to pay the regular quarterly dividends on each share of outstanding series b common stock in kind  or a total of million  million and million shares of series b common stock  respectively  during  and in december  lyondell elected to convert the million outstanding shares of series b common stock  owned by ochc  into common stock 
as a result  lyondell s cash dividend payments will increase by approximately million annually beginning in  if maintained at the current rate  and no shares of series b common stock remain outstanding as of december  following these transactions  including the payment of dividends to ochc in the form of shares of series b common stock  ochc owns a equity interest in lyondell as of december  in connection with the august transactions with ochc  lyondell agreed to provide registration rights to ochc and its permitted transferees with respect to shares of lyondell s common stock issued to ochc as a dividend  upon conversion of the series b common stock which conversion occurred on december  or upon exercise of the warrants referenced above 
the warrants do not have registration rights 
lyondell also made debt payments of million during primarily using proceeds of certain asset sales  as required by the terms of the credit facility 
liquidity and capital resources lyondell s balance sheet remains highly leveraged 
as of december   total debt  which included debt of equistar and millennium  was billion  or approximately of total capitalization 
in addition  as of december  lyondell s lcr joint venture had approximately million of debt see joint venture debt and equity investment in joint venture below 
lcc has not guaranteed equistar s  millennium s or lcr s credit facilities or debt obligations  except for million of equistar debt  consisting of the notes due and the debentures due however  lcc s credit facility generally limits investments by lyondell in equistar  millennium and other specified investees unless certain conditions are satisfied 
in addition  millennium s debt covenants may restrict its ability to make distributions to lcc 
equistar s ability to make distributions to lyondell and millennium may be affected by an additional interest requirement in certain of equistar s indentures 
the level of debt and the limitations imposed on lcc  equistar and millennium by their respective current or future debt agreements  including the restrictions on their ability to transfer cash among the entities as further discussed below  could have significant consequences on lyondell s business and future prospects 
see note to the consolidated 
table of contents financial statements for a further description of long term debt and credit facilities and the collateral securing certain of these debt instruments 
lyondell s ability to pay or refinance its debt will depend on future operating performance  which could be affected by general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  business and other factors  many of which are beyond its control 
during the year ended december   lyondell s capital expenditures of million exceeded net cash provided by operating activities of million 
this deficit reflected the purchase of the previously leased botlek bdo plant for million  which was financed by the issuance of senior secured notes 
however  lyondell believes that conditions will be such that cash balances  cash generated from operating activities  cash distributions from joint ventures and funds from lines of credit will be adequate to meet anticipated future cash requirements  including scheduled debt repayments  necessary capital expenditures  ongoing operations and dividends 
at december   lyondell had cash on hand of million  which included million of cash held by millennium that is not currently available for dividends to lcc and million of cash held by equistar 
lyondell s total unused availability under various liquidity facilities of million as of december  included the following million under lcc s amended and restated million senior secured revolving credit facility  which matures in december availability under the revolving credit facility is reduced to the extent of outstanding letters of credit provided under the credit facility  which totaled million as of december  there was no outstanding borrowing under the revolving credit facility at december  million under equistar s million inventory based revolving credit facility and its million accounts receivable sales facility  after giving effect to the borrowing base net of a million unused availability requirement  million sold under the accounts receivable sales facility and million of outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility as of december  the borrowing base is determined using a formula applied to accounts receivable and inventory balances 
the revolving credit facility requires that the unused available amounts under that facility and the million accounts receivable sales facility equal or exceed million through march  and million thereafter or million thereafter if the interest coverage ratio  as defined  is less than there was no outstanding borrowing under the revolving credit facility at december  million under millennium s million secured revolving credit facility  which matures in june availability under the revolving credit facility is reduced to the extent of outstanding letters of credit provided under the facility  which totaled million as of december  there was no outstanding borrowing under the revolving credit facility as of december  see also off balance sheet arrangements accounts receivable sales facilities below for availability under lcc s accounts receivable sales facility and equistar s accounts receivable sales facility 
lcc debt as noted above under financing activities  in december  lcc entered into an amended and restated credit facility  establishing a million senior secured revolving credit facility  which matures in december the amended credit facility replaced lcc s previous million revolving credit facility  which was scheduled to mature in june in june  lcc obtained an amendment to its previous credit facility that permitted the millennium transaction and placed certain limits on investments by lyondell in equistar  millennium and specified joint ventures 
lcc also obtained amendments to its previous credit facility in february  march and july to provide additional financial flexibility by easing certain financial ratio requirements 
lcc s credit facility and the indentures pertaining to lcc s senior secured notes and senior subordinated notes contain covenants that  subject to exceptions  restrict sale and leaseback transactions  lien incurrence  debt incurrence  dividends  investments  non regulatory capital expenditures  certain other payments  sales of assets 
table of contents and mergers 
in addition  the amended credit facility requires lcc to maintain specified financial ratios  as defined in the amended and restated credit agreement 
specifically  lcc is not permitted to allow the interest coverage ratio  as defined  for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on or most recently prior to each of the indicated dates below  to be less than the indicated ratio or to allow the senior secured debt to adjusted ebitda ratio  as defined  for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on or prior to the indicated dates below to be greater than the indicated ratio interest coverage ratio senior secured debt to adjusted ebitda ratio december  march  june  september  december  march  june  september  and thereafter lcc s ability to comply with these financial ratio requirements will be dependent upon continuing improvement in results of operations 
the breach of the covenants in lcc s debt agreements could permit the lenders to declare any outstanding lcc debt payable and could permit the lenders under lcc s credit facility to terminate future lending commitments 
furthermore  under certain circumstances  a default under the debt instruments of equistar or millennium would constitute a cross default under lcc s credit facility which  under certain circumstances  would then constitute a default under lcc s indentures 
lcc was in compliance with all such covenants as of december  equistar debt equistar s million inventory based revolving credit facility and the indentures governing its senior notes contain covenants that  subject to certain exceptions  restrict lien incurrence  debt incurrence  sales of assets  investments  capital expenditures  certain other payments  and mergers 
the credit facility does not require equistar to maintain specified financial ratios 
the breach of the covenants could permit the lenders or noteholders to declare any outstanding equistar debt payable and could permit the lenders under equistar s inventory based revolving credit facility to terminate future lending commitments 
in addition  some of equistar s indentures require additional interest payments to the noteholders if equistar makes distributions to lyondell and millennium when equistar does not meet a specified fixed charge coverage ratio 
equistar met this ratio and was in compliance with all covenants under these agreements as of december  millennium debt the millennium credit facility contains various restrictive covenants and requires millennium to maintain specified financial ratios 
millennium obtained amendments to its credit facility in the fourth quarter of  the second quarters of and  and the fourth quarter of to provide additional financial flexibility by easing certain financial ratio requirements 
the amendment in the second quarter of was conditioned upon the offering of million principal amount of the senior notes and the use of the proceeds for the repayment of the credit facility debt 
the amendment in the fourth quarter of was conditioned on millennium obtaining million of long term financing  which was satisfied by the sale of million of the convertible senior debentures 
the amendment in the fourth quarter of also reduced the maximum availability under the credit facility from million to million 
millennium also obtained an amendment to its credit facility in july to permit the business combination with lyondell 
on february   millennium entered into an amendment and waiver to its credit facility  which amended the definition of ebitda and waived any and all defaults and events of default that may have occurred on or prior to the amendment and waiver as a result of certain adjustments and charges related to the february restatement of millennium s financial statements 

table of contents under the terms of its credit facility  millennium is not permitted to allow the senior secured leverage ratio  as defined  for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on the indicated dates below  to be more than the indicated ratio  or to allow the interest coverage ratio  as defined  for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on the indicated dates below  to be less than the indicated ratio senior secured leverage ratio interest coverage ratio december  march  and thereafter the covenants in millennium s credit facility  the indenture under which millennium s and senior debentures were issued and the indenture under which millennium s senior notes were issued limit  among other things  the ability of millennium and or certain subsidiaries of millennium to incur debt  create liens  engage in sale leaseback transactions  declare or pay dividends on  or purchase  millennium s stock  make restricted payments  engage in transactions with affiliates  engage in mergers or acquisitions  engage in domestic accounts receivable securitization transactions  enter into restrictive agreements  transfer substantially all of their respective assets  issue redeemable stock and preferred stock  sell or otherwise dispose of assets  including capital stock of subsidiaries and enter into arrangements that restrict dividends from subsidiaries 
pursuant to these provisions  millennium currently is prohibited from making restricted payments  including paying dividends 
millennium has outstanding million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior debentures  which are due in  unless earlier redeemed  converted or repurchased 
on october   based on a quarterly test related to the price of the common stock  the convertible senior debentures became convertible into shares of millennium s common stock 
as a result of lyondell s acquisition of millennium  millennium and lyondell executed a supplemental indenture providing that the holders of the convertible senior debentures may convert their debentures into shares of lyondell s common stock or equivalent cash or a combination thereof at a conversion price as of december   subject to adjustment upon certain events  of per share  which is equivalent to a conversion rate of lyondell shares per one thousand dollar principal amount of the debentures 
as of december   none of the convertible senior debentures were converted into shares of lyondell common stock 
the debentures are redeemable at millennium s option beginning november  at a redemption price equal to of their principal amount 
on november in each of  and  holders of the debentures will have the right to require millennium to repurchase all or some of the debentures they own at a purchase price equal to of their principal amount 
millennium may choose to pay the purchase price in cash or shares of lyondell s common stock or any combination thereof 
in the event of a conversion request as a result of the long term credit rating assigned to the debentures being either caa or lower  in the case of moody s investors service moody s  or b or lower in the case of standard poor s s p rating service  or if both rating agencies discontinue  withdraw or suspend their ratings  after june   millennium can deliver cash  or a combination of cash and shares of lyondell common stock  in lieu of shares of lyondell common stock 
the debentures are currently rated b by moody s and b by s p 
holders of the debentures also have the right to require millennium to repurchase all or some of the debentures at a cash purchase price equal to of their principal amount  upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a fundamental change  as defined 
lyondell s acquisition of millennium was not considered a fundamental change  as defined in the indenture 
the breach of the covenants in millennium s debt agreements could permit the lenders to declare any outstanding millennium debt payable and could permit the lenders under millennium s credit facility to terminate future lending commitments 
millennium was in compliance with all covenants under its debt agreements as of december  
table of contents millennium s credit facility is guaranteed by millennium and millennium america inc  a subsidiary of millennium millennium america  millennium s senior notes  senior debentures and senior notes were issued by millennium america and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by millennium  and millennium s convertible senior debentures were issued by millennium and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by millennium america 
joint venture debt at december   the outstanding debt of lcr to parties other than lyondell was million 
this debt is not carried on lyondell s balance sheet because lyondell has no obligation with respect to that debt 
the ability of lcr to distribute cash to lyondell may be affected by restrictive covenants in lcr s credit facility 
off balance sheet arrangements the securities and exchange commission sec has described various characteristics to identify contractual arrangements that would fall within the sec s definition of off balance sheet arrangements 
lyondell is a party to the following arrangements that have some of those characteristics accounts receivable sales facilities lcc has a million  four year  accounts receivable sales facility  and equistar has a million  four year  accounts receivable sales facility 
pursuant to the facilities  lyondell sells  through wholly owned bankruptcy remote subsidiaries  on an ongoing basis and without recourse  an interest in a pool of domestic accounts receivable to financial institutions participating in the facility 
lyondell is responsible for servicing the receivables 
the amount of interest in the pool of receivables permitted to be sold is determined by a formula 
the lcc agreement currently permits the sale of up to million of total interest in domestic accounts receivable  which amount would decline by million if lcc s credit facility were fully drawn 
equistar s borrowing base is determined using a formula applied to accounts receivable and inventory balances and is net of a million unused availability requirement 
the outstanding amount of receivables sold under both of the facilities was million as of december  accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets are reduced by the sales of interests in the pool 
the facilities accelerate availability to the business of cash from product sales that otherwise would have been collected over the normal billing and collection cycle 
the availability of the accounts receivable sales facilities provides one element of lyondell s ongoing sources of liquidity and capital resources 
upon termination of the facilities  cash collections related to accounts receivable then in the pool would first be applied to the outstanding interest sold  but lyondell would in no event be required to repurchase such interest 
in june  lcc s accounts receivable sales facility was amended to permit the acquisition of millennium 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional accounts receivable information 
equity investment in joint venture lyondell holds a variable equity interest in the lcr joint venture 
there are various contractual arrangements for the purchase and sale of product among lyondell and lcr  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
although lyondell does not believe that this joint venture investment represents the type of arrangement intended to be addressed by the sec s definition of off balance sheet arrangements  it is important to the future liquidity of  and is therefore a capital resource to  lyondell 
although distribution to its owners of the earnings of lcr has represented a source of cash for lyondell in recent years  the debt of lcr is not a source of liquidity or a capital resource for lyondell 
the known events and trends affecting this joint venture are discussed above in the operating results sections and within this financial condition section 
the effects of this investment on lyondell s financial statements are disclosed on the face of the consolidated financial statements and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
other obligations that do not give rise to liabilities that would be reflected in lyondell s balance sheet are described below under purchase obligations and operating leases 

table of contents contractual and other obligations the following table summarizes  as of december   lyondell s minimum payments for long term debt  and contractual and other obligations for the next five years and thereafter 
payments due by period millions of dollars total thereafter contractual obligations long term debt interest payable pension benefits pbo assets funded status other postretirement benefits advances from customers other noncurrent obligations deferred income taxes other contractual obligations purchase obligations operating leases total long term debt lyondell s long term debt includes credit facilities and debt obligations of lcc  as well as credit facilities and debt obligations maintained by lyondell s wholly owned subsidiaries  equistar and millennium 
lcc has not guaranteed the subsidiaries credit facilities or debt obligations  except for million of equistar debt 
see liquidity and capital resources above for a discussion of covenant requirements under the credit facilities and indentures of lcc  equistar and millennium 
also see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding long term debt 
interest payable the long term debt agreements contain provisions for the payment of either monthly or semi annual interest at a stated rate of interest over the term of the debt 
these payment obligations are reflected in the table above 
pension benefits lyondell maintains several defined benefit pension plans  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the projected benefit obligation for lyondell s pension plans  including equistar and millennium plans  exceeded the fair value of plan assets by million 
subject to future actuarial gains and losses  as well as actual asset earnings  lyondell  together with its consolidated subsidiaries  will be required to fund the million  with interest  in future years 
the minimum required contribution may reach an annual rate of approximately million by lyondell s pension contributions were million  million and million in the years  and  respectively  and are estimated to be approximately million in  including equistar and millennium plans 
past pension contributions by equistar were million  million and million in  and  respectively  and by millennium were million  million and million in the same years 
during  lyondell s minimum pension liability increased by million  with a related charge to other comprehensive income 
this increase was primarily the result of the consolidation of millennium and equistar  which resulted in an additional minimum pension liability of million 
during  lyondell s minimum pension liability declined by million  largely as a result of improved plan asset performance  and during  lyondell recognized an increase in its minimum pension liability of million  with a corresponding charge to other comprehensive income 
the million cumulative minimum pension liability represents accumulated pension benefit obligations in excess of pension plan assets at december  other postretirement benefits lyondell provides other postretirement benefits  primarily medical benefits  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
other postretirement benefits are unfunded and are paid by lyondell as incurred 
estimates of other postretirement benefit payments through are included in the table above 

table of contents advances from customers lyondell received advances from customers in prior years in connection with long term sales agreements under which lyondell is obligated to deliver product primarily at cost based prices 
these advances are treated as deferred revenue and will be amortized to earnings over the remaining terms of the respective contracts  which primarily range from to years 
the unamortized long term portion of such advances totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the increase from to resulted from lyondell s acquisition of millennium and consolidation of equistar see note to the consolidated financial statements  as equistar s unamortized long term portion of advances received from customers in and was million as of december  other noncurrent obligations other noncurrent obligations primarily include accruals for environmental remediation costs and obligations under deferred compensation arrangements 
deferred income taxes the scheduled settlement of the deferred tax liabilities shown in the table is based on the scheduled reversal of the underlying temporary differences  all of which would be fully offset during the first five years by lyondell s tax loss carry forwards 
actual cash tax payments will vary dependent upon future taxable income 
purchase obligations lyondell is party to various obligations to purchase products and services  principally for utilities and industrial gases and ore used in the production of tio these commitments are designed to assure sources of supply and are not expected to be in excess of normal requirements 
included in purchase obligations is a commitment to purchase minimum annual quantities of toluene diamine tda from rhodia through and to reimburse rhodia for the costs of operating the tdi facility at pont de claix  france  through march  for which tda is the principal raw material 
the rhodia obligations  denominated in euros  include fixed and variable components 
the actual future obligation will vary with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  market prices of raw materials and other variable cost components such as utility costs 
approximately of the annual payments through and of the annual payments thereafter shown in the table above are subject to such variability 
see the commitments section of note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of lyondell s commitments and contingencies  including these purchase obligations 
operating leases lyondell leases various facilities and equipment under noncancelable lease arrangements for various periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for related lease disclosures 
lcr liquidity and capital resources in may  lcr refinanced its credit facilities with a new facility  consisting of a million senior secured term loan and a million senior secured revolver  which matures in may the term loan requires quarterly amortization payments of million  which began in september the new facility replaced lcr s million bank loan facility and million revolving credit facility  which were scheduled to mature in june  is secured by substantially all of the assets of lcr and contains covenants that require lcr to maintain specified financial ratios covering debt to total capitalization  ebitda to interest expense and secured debt to ebitda  all as defined 
the financial ratios under the new facility are generally less restrictive 
in september  lcr obtained an amendment to the new facility that reduced the interest rate and eased certain financial covenants  including the debt to total capitalization ratio 
the revolving credit facility  which was undrawn at december   is reduced to the extent of outstanding letters of credit provided under the credit facility  which totaled million as of december  lcr was in compliance with all covenants under its credit facility as of december  as part of the may refinancing  lyondell and citgo extended the maturity of the lcr loans payable to partners  including million payable to lyondell and million payable to citgo  from july to january 
table of contents current business outlook business conditions continue to be positive for the majority of lyondell s products  and lyondell continues to benefit from strong economics for its liquids based ethylene facilities 
supply demand conditions for the majority of lyondell s products have strengthened  and lyondell generally expects this strengthening to continue throughout through the spring of  lyondell expects that its gasoline related products and tio will benefit from typical seasonal improvement 
lcr s operating results will be affected by maintenance turnarounds of two major operating units in the second quarter additionally  it is expected that certain favorable timing factors in the csa contract  which contributed to record results  may not recur 
volatile and elevated energy prices and resultant raw material prices continue to be a concern 
while the industry appears to continue to adapt to this energy price environment  the primary concern is the impact that it may have on the broader global economy 
overall  lyondell believes that will be characterized by additional tightening of supply demand for its products 
related party transactions lyondell had significant related party transactions with equistar  including significant purchases of raw materials from equistar and significant administrative services provided to equistar 
in addition  equistar and lcr  as well as other parties related to equistar and lcr  engage in significant transactions among themselves 
occidental  which owns a interest in lyondell  makes significant purchases of raw materials from equistar 
lyondell believes that such related party transactions are effected on terms substantially no more or less favorable than those that would have been agreed upon by third parties on an arm s length basis 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of related party transactions involving lyondell  equistar and lcr 
critical accounting policies lyondell applies those accounting policies that management believes best reflect the underlying business and economic events  consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the us lyondell s more critical accounting policies include those related to the basis of presentation  long lived assets  including the costs of major maintenance turnarounds and repairs  the valuation of goodwill  accruals for long term employee benefit costs such as pension and other postretirement costs  liabilities for anticipated expenditures to comply with environmental regulations  and accruals for taxes based on income 
inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates made by management 
management periodically updates its estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on its latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment 
these critical accounting policies have been discussed with the audit committee of lyondell s board of directors 
lyondell s significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
basis of presentation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of lyondell and its subsidiaries 
investments in joint ventures where lyondell exerts a certain level of management control  but lacks full decision making ability over all major issues  are accounted for using the equity method 
for the major unconsolidated joint ventures  lcr and  prior to december   equistar  governance is generally based on equal representation from the partners who jointly control certain key management decisions 
these include approval of the strategic plan  capital expenditures and annual budget  issuance of debt and the appointment of executive management of the joint venture 
accordingly  lyondell s investment in lcr and  prior to december   equistar  are carried on the equity method  even though lyondell s ownership percentage exceeds 

table of contents long lived assets with respect to long lived assets  key assumptions include the estimates of useful asset lives and the recoverability of carrying values of fixed assets and other intangible assets  as well as the existence of any obligations associated with the retirement of fixed assets 
such estimates could be significantly modified and or the carrying values of the assets could be impaired by such factors as new technological developments  new chemical industry entrants with significant raw material or other cost advantages  uncertainties associated with the us and world economies  the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries  and uncertainties associated with governmental actions  whether regulatory or  in the case of lcr  with respect to the csa 
to reflect economic and market conditions  from time to time lyondell may temporarily idle manufacturing facilities 
assets that are temporarily idled are reviewed for impairment at the time they are idled  and at least annually thereafter 
fixed assets with a net book value of million were temporarily idled as of december  those assets continue to be depreciated over their remaining useful lives 
no impairments were recorded in  or for temporarily idled facilities 
lyondell defers the costs of major periodic maintenance and repair activities turnarounds in excess of million  amortizing such costs over the period until the next expected major turnaround of the affected unit 
during  and  lyondell s cash expenditures excluding equistar s and millennium s expenditures in december of million  million and million  respectively  were deferred and are being amortized  predominantly over to years 
during the same years  equistar expenditures of million  million and million  and millennium expenditures of million  million and million were similarly deferred 
lyondell s amortization in  and  of previously deferred turnaround costs was million  million and million  respectively 
the estimated useful lives of long lived assets range from to years 
depreciation and amortization of these assets  including amortization of deferred turnaround costs  under the straight line method over their estimated useful lives totaled million in if the useful lives of the assets were found to be shorter than originally estimated  depreciation and amortization charges would be accelerated 
during  depreciation of property  plant and equipment increased to million from million in  partly due to a reduction in the estimated remaining useful lives of certain production assets 
additional information on long lived assets  deferred turnaround costs and related depreciation and amortization appears in note to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of acquired businesses 
lyondell evaluates the carrying value of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value 
recoverability is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill applies to the carrying value  including goodwill  of that reporting unit 
as a result of the acquisition of millennium  lyondell recognized an additional billion of goodwill in  and the carrying value of lyondell s goodwill totaled billion at december  the recoverability of lyondell s goodwill is dependent upon the future valuations associated with its reporting units  which could change significantly based upon business performance or other factors 
long term employee benefit costs the costs to lyondell of long term employee benefits  particularly pension and other postretirement medical and life insurance benefits  are incurred over long periods of time  and involve many uncertainties over those periods 
the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties  and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions 
it is management s responsibility  often with the assistance of independent experts  to select assumptions that in its judgment represent its best estimates of the future effects of those uncertainties 
it also is management s responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions 

table of contents the current benefit service costs  as well as the existing liabilities  for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis 
the discount rate is a current rate  related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled 
lyondell s assumed discount rate is based on average rates published by moody s and merrill lynch for high quality aa rating ten year fixed income securities 
for the purpose of measuring the us benefit obligations at december   lyondell lowered its assumed discount rate from to  reflecting the general decline in market interest rates during the rate also will be used to measure net periodic benefit cost during a further one percentage point reduction in the assumed discount rate for lyondell and lcr would increase lyondell s benefit obligation for pensions and other postretirement benefits by approximately million  and would reduce lyondell s net income  including the impact on income from lyondell s equity investment in lcr  by approximately million 
the benefit obligation and the periodic cost of other postretirement medical benefits also are measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits 
as of december   the assumed rate of increase was for  for through and thereafter 
a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate assumption would have no significant effect on either the benefit liability or the net periodic cost  due to limits on lyondell s maximum contribution level under the medical plan 
the net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense also is affected by the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption 
investment returns that are recognized currently in net income represent the expected long term rate of return on plan assets applied to a market related value of plan assets which  for lyondell  is defined as the market value of assets 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is a longer term rate  and is expected to change less frequently than the current assumed discount rate  reflecting long term market expectations  rather than current fluctuations in market conditions 
prior to  lyondell s expected long term rate of return on us plan assets of had been based on the average level of earnings that its independent pension investment advisor had advised could be expected to be earned over time 
the expectation was based on an asset allocation of us equity securities expected return  us equity securities expected return  and fixed income securities expected return that had been recommended by the advisor  and had been adopted for the plans 
over the three year period ended december   lyondell s actual return on plan assets was a loss averaging per year 
in  lyondell reviewed its asset allocation and expected long term rate of return and obtained an updated asset allocation recommendation from the independent pension investment advisor  including updated expectations for long term market earnings rates for various classes of investments 
based on this review  lyondell reduced its expected long term rate of return on plan assets to  and did not significantly change its plan asset allocations 
the actual return on plan assets in was 
the actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets 
management s goal is to manage the investments over the long term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility 
based on the market value of plan assets at december   a one percentage point decrease in this assumption for lyondell and lcr would decrease lyondell s net income  including the impact on income from its equity investment in lcr  by approximately million 
net periodic pension cost recognized each year includes the expected asset earnings  rather than the actual earnings or loss 
as a result of asset earnings significantly below the expected return on plan assets rate over the three year period ended december   the level of unrecognized investment losses  together with the net actuarial gains and losses  is million at december  this unrecognized amount  to the extent it exceeds ten percent of the projected benefit obligation for the respective plan  will be recognized as additional net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining service period of the participants in each plan 
this annual amortization charge would be million per year based on the december  unrecognized amount 

table of contents additional information on the key assumptions underlying these benefit costs appears in note to the consolidated financial statements 
liabilities for environmental remediation costs anticipated expenditures related to investigation and remediation of contaminated sites  which include operating facilities and waste disposal sites  are accrued when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
only ongoing operating and monitoring costs  the timing of which can be determined with reasonable certainty  are discounted to present value 
future legal costs associated with such matters  which generally are not estimable  are not included in these liabilities 
as of december   lyondell s environmental liability for future remediation costs at all current and former plant sites and superfund sites totaled million 
the liabilities for individual sites range from million to million and are expected to be incurred over a number of years  and not be concentrated in any single year 
in the opinion of management  there is no material estimable range of reasonably possible loss in excess of the liabilities recorded for environmental remediation 
however  it is possible that new information about the sites for which the accrual has been established  new technology or future developments such as involvement in investigations by regulatory agencies  could require lyondell to reassess its potential exposure related to environmental matters 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of environmental remediation matters 
accruals for taxes based on income uncertainties exist with respect to interpretation of complex us federal and us tax regulations 
management expects that lyondell s interpretations will prevail 
also  lyondell has recognized deferred tax benefits relating to its future utilization of past operating losses 
lyondell believes it is more likely than not that the amounts of deferred tax assets in excess of the related valuation reserves will be realized 
further details on lyondell s income taxes appear in note to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting and reporting changes to better reflect the full cost of employee compensation  lyondell adopted the fair value method of accounting for employee stock options  the preferred method as defined by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  in the first quarter lyondell is using the prospective transition method  one of three alternatives under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  for a voluntary change to the fair value method 
under the prospective transition method  an estimate of the fair value of options granted to employees during and thereafter is charged to earnings over the related vesting periods 
this change resulted in an after tax charge of approximately million for each of the years ended december  and see note to the consolidated financial statements 
effective january   lyondell implemented sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
upon implementation of sfas no 
 lyondell reviewed its goodwill for impairment and concluded that goodwill was not impaired 
however  equistar reviewed its goodwill for impairment and concluded that the entire balance was impaired  resulting in a billion charge to equistar s earnings as of january  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the conclusion was based on a comparison to equistar s indicated fair value  using multiples of ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization for comparable companies as an indicator of fair value 
lyondell s share of the equistar charge was offset by a corresponding reduction in the excess of lyondell s share of equistar s partners capital over the carrying value of lyondell s investment in equistar 
consequently  there was no net effect of the impairment on lyondell s earnings or investment in equistar 
as a result of implementing sfas no 
 lyondell s pretax income in and subsequent years is favorably affected by million annually because of the elimination of lyondell s goodwill amortization 

table of contents anticipated accounting changes in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
the primary focus of this statement is accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions  such as by the granting of stock options 
lyondell will be required to apply sfas no 
revised no later than the third quarter  using the fair value based method of accounting for share based payment transactions with employees rather than the intrinsic method previously allowed by apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
as noted above  lyondell has already adopted the fair value based method for accounting for its share based payment transactions with employees  and sfas no 
revised is not expected to have a material impact on lyondell s financial statements 
also in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  which amends apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets  which is replaced with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange is defined to have commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
lyondell will be required to adopt sfas no 
no later than the third quarter with prospective application 
lyondell is currently evaluating the impact  if any  that implementation of sfas no 
will have on its financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs 
the primary impact of the statement on lyondell will be recognition as period costs of any abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and spoilage 
the provisions of sfas no 
will be applied prospectively upon implementation  which is required no later than the first quarter lyondell does not expect application of sfas no 
to have a material impact on its financial statements 
environmental matters various environmental laws and regulations impose substantial requirements upon the operations of lyondell 
lyondell s policy is to be in compliance with such laws and regulations  which include  among others  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla or superfund as amended  the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and the clean air act amendments 
lyondell does not specifically track all recurring costs associated with managing hazardous substances and pollution in ongoing operations 
such costs are included in cost of sales 
lyondell also makes capital expenditures to comply with environmental regulations 
such capital expenditures in  and totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the spending includes equistar and millennium spending for the month of december capital expenditures by equistar on a basis for regulatory compliance in  and were million  million and million  respectively  and capital expenditures by lcr on a basis for regulatory compliance were million  million and million in the same periods 
the increase in lyondell s capital expenditures resulted from the emission reduction rules discussed in the next paragraph below 
lyondell currently estimates that these rules will result in further increases in expenditures at existing facilities  including equistar and millennium facilities  to approximately million in and million in  including estimated expenditures related to emission control standards for nitrogen oxides nox and highly reactive  volatile organic compounds hrvoc  as described below  and a wastewater management project 
capital spending to comply with environmental regulations at lcr s facilities on a basis is estimated to be approximately million in and million in the expected increase in environmental spending at lcr s facilities reflects spending for low sulfur fuels regulations  as well as for emission reductions 
under the clean air act  the eight county houston galveston region has been designated a severe non attainment area for ozone by the us environmental protection agency epa under a one hour ozone 
table of contents standard 
emission reduction controls for nox must be installed at lcr s refinery and each of lyondell s ten facilities in the houston galveston region prior to the november compliance deadline for the one hour ozone standard 
in addition  in december  the regulatory agency for the state of texas  the texas commission on environmental quality tceq  finalized controls over hrvocs 
lyondell and lcr are still assessing the impact of the hrvoc revisions 
in april  the epa designated the eight county houston galveston region a moderate non attainment area under an eight hour ozone standard 
as a result  the tceq must submit a plan to the epa in to demonstrate compliance with the eight hour ozone standard in although the one hour ozone standard expires in  the controls under that standard will not be relaxed under the epa s new eight hour transition rules 
as a result  lyondell and lcr still will be required to meet the new emission standards for nox and hrvocs 
the timing and amount of the estimated expenditures are subject to these regulatory and other uncertainties  as well as to obtaining the necessary permits and approvals 
the ultimate cost of implementing any plan developed to comply with the final ozone standards cannot be estimated at this time 
the clean air act also specified certain emissions standards for vehicles and  in  the epa concluded that additional controls on gasoline and diesel fuel were necessary 
new standards for gasoline were finalized in and required refiners to produce a low sulfur gasoline by  with final compliance by a new on road diesel standard was adopted in january and will require refiners of on road diesel fuel to produce as ultra low sulfur diesel ulsd by june and by the end of  with less stringent standards for off road diesel fuel 
to date  the off road diesel fuel standards have not been finalized 
these gasoline and diesel fuel standards will result in increased capital investment for lcr 
in addition  these standards could result in higher operating costs for lcr 
lyondell s business may also be impacted if these standards increase the cost for processing fuel components 
the clean air act amendments of set minimum levels for oxygenates  such as mtbe  in gasoline sold in areas not meeting specified air quality standards 
however  the presence of mtbe in some water supplies in california and other states due to gasoline leaking from underground storage tanks and in surface water from recreational water craft has led to public concern about the use of mtbe 
certain us states have banned the use of mtbe  while other us federal and state governmental initiatives have sought either to rescind the oxygen requirement for reformulated gasoline or to restrict or also ban the use of mtbe 
during  the us house of representatives and the us senate produced an energy bill that would have phased out the use of mtbe over years  but also provided limited liability protection for mtbe 
the house of representatives passed the bill as reported out of conference  but the senate did not 
a new energy bill was under consideration in the senate in that would have phased out use of mtbe  but would not have provided liability protection 
the senate bill was not passed during the final form and timing of the reconciliation of any energy bill in the us congress is uncertain 
at the state level  a number of states have legislated mtbe bans 
of these  several are mid west states that use ethanol as the oxygenate of choice 
bans in these states should not impact mtbe demand 
however  connecticut  california and new york have bans of mtbe in place effective january  these bans started to negatively affect mtbe demand during late in addition  in several major oil companies substantially reduced or discontinued the use of mtbe in gasoline produced for california markets  negatively affecting demand 
lyondell estimates that  in  california  connecticut and new york combined represented approximately one fourth of us mtbe industry demand 
at this time  lyondell cannot predict the full impact that these potential us federal and state governmental initiatives and state bans will have on mtbe margins or volumes longer term 
lyondell s north american mtbe sales represented approximately and of its total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
lyondell intends to continue marketing mtbe in the us however  should it become necessary or desirable to significantly reduce mtbe production  lyondell would need to make capital expenditures to add the flexibility to produce alternative gasoline blending components  such as iso octane  
table of contents iso octene also known as di isobutylene or ethyl tertiary butyl ether etbe  at its us based mtbe plant 
lyondell intends to install equipment at its channelview  texas facility that would provide lyondell with the flexibility to produce di isobutylene  an alternative gasoline component  instead of mtbe at that facility 
the current estimated cost of converting lyondell s us based mtbe plant to di isobutylene production is less than million 
lyondell s us based mtbe plant could be converted to etbe production with minimal capital expenditure 
lyondell is pursuing etbe viability through legislative efforts 
one key hurdle was equal access to the federal subsidy provided for ethanol blended into gasoline for the ethanol component of etbe  which was addressed in tax legislation enacted in lyondell is currently evaluating the effects of the new tax legislation  as well as the di isobutylene alternative  prior to making any ultimate decision  which will be influenced by further regulatory and market developments 
the profit contribution related to alternative gasoline blending components is likely to be lower than that historically realized on mtbe 
a millennium subsidiary  which is now a subsidiary of lyondell  has been identified as a prp with respect to the kalamazoo river superfund site 
the site involves cleanup of river sediments and floodplain soils contaminated with pcbs  cleanup of former paper mill operations  and cleanup and closure of landfills associated with the former paper mill operations 
in  the krsg  of which the millennium subsidiary and other prps are members  submitted to the state of michigan a draft remedial investigation and draft feasibility study  which evaluated a number of remedial options for the river 
the estimated costs for these remedial options ranged from to billion 
at the end of  the epa took lead responsibility for the river portion of the site at the request of the state of michigan 
in  the epa initiated a confidential process to facilitate discussions among the agency  the millennium subsidiary  other prps  the michigan departments of environmental quality and natural resources  and certain federal natural resource trustees about the need for additional investigation activities and different possible approaches for addressing the contamination in and along the kalamazoo river 
as of december   the probable liability associated with the river cannot be determined with certainty 
a liability of million has been recognized  representing millennium s interim allocation of of the million estimated cost of bank stabilization  recommended as the preferred remedy in by the krsg 
although the krsg study identified a broad range of remedial options  not all of those options would represent reasonably possible outcomes 
management does not believe that it can identify a single remedy among those options that would represent the highest cost reasonably possible outcome 
in addition  lyondell has recognized a liability of million primarily related to millennium s estimated share of remediation costs for two former paper mill sites and associated landfills  which are also part of the kalamazoo river superfund site 
although no final agreement has been reached as to the ultimate remedy for these locations  millennium has begun remediation activity related to these sites 
millennium s ultimate liability for the kalamazoo river superfund site will depend on many factors that have not yet been determined  including the ultimate remedy selected  the determination of natural resource damages  the number and financial viability of the other prps  and the determination of the final allocation among the prps 
as of december   lyondell s environmental liability for future remediation costs at all current and former plant sites and superfund sites totaled million 
the liabilities for individual sites range from million to million and are expected to be incurred over a number of years  and not be concentrated in any single year 
in the opinion of management  there is no material estimable range of reasonably possible loss in excess of the liabilities recorded for environmental remediation 
however  it is possible that new information about the sites for which the accrual has been established  new technology or future developments such as involvement in investigations by regulatory agencies  could require lyondell to reassess its potential exposure related to environmental matters

disclosure of market and regulatory risk commodity price risk a substantial portion of lyondell s products and raw materials  as well as those of lcr  are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply and demand fundamentals change 
accordingly  product margins and the level of lyondell s profitability tend to fluctuate with changes in the business cycle 
lyondell tries to protect against such instability through various business strategies 
these include entering into multi year processing and sales agreements  moving downstream into derivatives products whose pricing is more stable  utilization of the raw material flexibility of equistar s ethylene plants and the use of the deemed margin contract at lcr 
in addition  lyondell selectively uses commodity swap  option  and futures contracts with various terms to manage the volatility related to purchases of natural gas and raw materials  as well as product sales 
market risks created by these derivative instruments and the mark to market valuations of open positions are monitored by management 
during  and  the derivative transactions were not significant compared to lyondell s overall inventory purchases and product sales 
at december   the market value of outstanding derivatives and the related value at risk was not material 
foreign exchange risk lyondell manufactures and markets its products in a number of countries throughout the world and  as a result  is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
costs in some countries are incurred  in part  in currencies other than the applicable functional currency 
lyondell utilizes forward  swap and option derivative contracts with terms normally lasting less than three months to protect against the adverse effect that exchange rate fluctuations may have on foreign currency denominated trade receivables and trade payables 
these derivatives generally are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
at december   foreign currency forward and swap contracts in the notional amount of million were outstanding 
assuming a unfavorable change in foreign exchange rates  the negative impact on earnings would be approximately million after tax 
sensitivity analysis was used for this purpose 
interest rate risk lyondell had no borrowing outstanding under its variable rate revolving credit facilities at december   and its remaining exposure to interest rate risk was minimal 
derivative instruments have been used selectively to manage the ratio of fixed to variable rate debt at millennium 
at december   there were outstanding interest rate swap agreements in the notional amount of million  which were designated as fair value hedges of underlying fixed rate obligations 
the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements was an obligation of million at december   resulting in a decrease in the carrying value of long term debt and the recognition of a corresponding liability 
assuming a unfavorable change in variable interest rates  the negative impact on the fair value of the obligations would be approximately million 
sensitivity analysis was used for this purpose 
at december   lcr had variable rate debt of million  excluding the note payable by lcr to lyondell 
lyondell s exposure to interest rate risk at lcr was not material 
sensitivity analysis was used for purposes of this analysis

new air pollution standards promulgated by federal and state regulatory agencies in the us  including those specifically targeting the eight county houston galveston region  will affect a substantial portion of the operating facilities of lyondell  equistar and lcr and two millennium facilities 
compliance with these standards will result in increased capital investment during the next several years and higher annual operating costs for lyondell  equistar  millennium and lcr 
lyondell is still assessing the impact of these proposed regulations  and the ultimate cost of implementing any plan developed to comply with the final ozone standards cannot be estimated at this time
