item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read together with the other financial information and consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those discussed in forward looking statements and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a diversified provider of outsourced services and specialty products 
we perform a wide range of manufacturing  engineering  design  testing and other technical services  typically under multi year  sole source contracts with major companies and government agencies in the markets for aerospace defense electronics  truck components assemblies  and test measurement services 
revenue from our three core markets accounted for approximately of our revenue for the year ended december   while revenue from our outsourced services accounted for approximately of our revenue 
we expect these percentages to increase in the future 
the company is organized into two business groups  the industrial group and the electronics group 
the industrial group is one reportable business segment  while the electronics group includes two reportable business segments  aerospace defense and test measurement 
the industrial group is comprised of sypris technologies  inc and its subsidiaries  which generates revenue primarily from the sale of manufacturing services to customers in the market for truck components assemblies and from the sale of products to the energy and chemical markets 
the aerospace defense reportable segment is comprised of sypris data systems  inc and sypris electronics  llc 
revenue from this group is derived primarily from the sale of manufacturing services  technical services and products to customers in the market for aerospace defense electronics 
the test measurement reportable segment consists solely of sypris test measurement  inc  which generates revenue primarily from providing technical services for the calibration  certification and repair of test and measurement equipment in the us we previously had only two reportable business segments and therefore  segment information for and has been reclassified to be consistent with the current year presentation 
our objective is to become the leading outsourcing specialist in each of our core markets for aerospace defense electronics  truck components assemblies  and test measurement services 
we have focused our efforts on establishing long term relationships with industry leaders who embrace multi year contractual relationships as a strategic component of their supply chain management 
recent contract awards 
the pursuit of multi year contractual relationships with industry leaders in each of our core market segments is a key component of our strategy 
we focus primarily on those candidates that will enable us to consolidate positions of leadership in our existing markets  further develop strategic partnerships with leading companies  and expand our capability and capacity to increase our value added service offerings 
the quality of these contracts has enabled us to invest in leading edge technologies that we believe will serve as an important means for differentiating ourselves in the future from the competition when it comes to cost  quality  reliability and customer service 
on december   we completed the first phase of a two phase transaction with dana in which we entered into a new eight year agreement to supply a wide range of drive train components for the light  medium and heavy duty truck markets to dana 
in connection with this agreement  we acquired the property  plant  and equipment and certain component inventories associated with dana s manufacturing plant in morganton  north carolina for a purchase price of approximately million 
in addition  the parties agreed to a three year extension of an existing seven year supply agreement that we originally entered into on may  in the second phase of the transaction  which closed on june   we entered into an eight year agreement with dana for the supply of forged and machined components for use in the medium and heavy duty truck markets 
in connection with this agreement  we acquired certain of the property  plant  and equipment as well as certain component inventories associated with dana s manufacturing campus in toluca  mexico 
during  we also acquired or entered into agreements to acquire certain production equipment located at other dana facilities in the us and amended the terms of our various supply agreements with dana to extend the expiration date of all supply agreements to september 
table of contents 
index to financial statements on may   we entered into a series of multi year contracts with arvinmeritor to supply trailer axle beams and a variety of drive train components to arvinmeritor 
the outsourcing arrangement will begin in phases over the next several years  the first of which began on may  the initial terms of the contracts vary  but in each case represent a long term  multi year commitment to the supply arrangement 
as part of the transaction  we acquired certain of the property  plant  and equipment as well as certain component inventories associated with arvinmeritor s kenton  ohio plant that specializes in the manufacture of trailer axle beams 
in addition  the transaction provided for a five year extension of an existing five year supply agreement that would have expired on december  under which we supply arvinmeritor with axle shafts for medium and heavy duty trucks 
the net revenue from the operations acquired in these transactions was million in the prices contained in these agreements for our services are fixed for an initial term and generally reduced thereafter in accordance with schedules contained in the agreements 
we believe these price reductions will not materially affect our profitability 
we purchase raw steel and fabricated steel parts for these agreements at the direction of our customers  with any periodic changes in the price of steel being reflected in the prices we are paid for our services  such that we neither benefit from nor are directly harmed by any future changes in the price of steel 
the agreements also provide for us to share in the benefits of any cost reduction suggestions that we make that are accepted by our customers 
accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and cost estimation on certain contracts for which we use percentage of completion methods of accounting  allowance for doubtful accounts  impairments and reserves for excess  obsolete and scrap inventory  as described immediately below 
the complexity of the estimation process and all issues related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion methodologies affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors affect our cost of sales estimates  including labor rate and efficiency variances  revised estimates of warranty costs  estimated future material prices and customer specification and testing requirement changes 
if our business conditions were different  or if we used different assumptions in the application of this and other accounting policies  it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported in our consolidated financial statements 
net revenue 
the majority of our outsourced services revenue is derived from manufacturing services contracts under which we supply products to our customers according to specifications provided under our contracts 
we generally recognize revenue for these outsourced services  as well as our product sales  when we ship the products  at which time title generally passes to the customer 
contract revenue in our aerospace defense segment is recognized using the percentage of completion method  generally using units of delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract 
revenue is recognized on these contracts when units are delivered to the customer  with unit revenue based upon unit prices as set forth in the applicable contracts 
the costs attributed to contract revenue are based upon the estimated average costs of all units to be shipped 
the cumulative average costs of units shipped to date are adjusted through current operations as estimates of future costs to complete change 
revenue under certain other multi year fixed price contracts is recorded using achievement of performance milestones or cost to cost as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract 
the basis for the measurement of progress toward completion is applied consistently to contracts with similar performance characteristics 
amounts representing contract change orders or claims are included in revenue when these costs are reliably estimated and realization is probable 
we recognize all other revenue as product is shipped and title passes  or when the service is provided to the customer 
our net revenue includes adjustments for estimated product warranty and allowances for returns by our customers 
generally  the percentage of completion method based on units of delivery is applied by our aerospace defense segment for outsourced services provided under multi year contracts 
approximately  and of total net revenue was recognized under the percentage of completion method based on units of delivery during  and  respectively 
approximately and of total net revenue was recognized under the percentage of completion method based on milestones or cost to cost during and  respectively 
in  substantially all such amounts were accounted for under the units of delivery method 

table of contents 
index to financial statements cost of sales 
cost of sales consists primarily of our payments to our suppliers  compensation  payroll taxes and employee benefits for service and manufacturing personnel  and purchasing and manufacturing overhead costs 
the contracts for which our aerospace defense segment recognizes net revenue under the percentage of completion method involve the use of estimates for cost of sales 
we compare estimated costs to complete an entire contract to total net revenue for the term of the contract to arrive at an estimated gross margin percentage for each contract 
each month  the estimated gross margin percentage is applied to the cumulative net revenue recognized on the contract to arrive at cost of sales for the period 
these estimates require judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract revenues and costs  and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
these estimates are complicated and subject to many variables 
contract costs include material  labor and subcontract costs  as well as an allocation of indirect costs 
for contract change orders  claims or similar items  we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 
management reviews these estimates monthly and the effect of any change in the estimated gross margin percentage for a contract is reflected in cost of sales in the period in which the change is known 
if increases in projected costs to complete are sufficient to create a loss contract  the entire estimated loss is charged to operations in the period the loss first becomes known 
additionally  our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory is primarily based upon forecasted demand for our products and any change to the reserve arising from forecast revisions is reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we establish reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable based on overall receivable aging levels  a specific evaluation of accounts for customers with known financial difficulties and evaluation of customer chargebacks  if any 
these reserves and corresponding write offs could significantly increase if our customers experience deteriorating financial results or in the event we receive a significant chargeback which is deemed uncollectible 
impairments 
consistent with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment by calculating the estimated fair value of each business with which goodwill is associated 
the estimated fair value is based on a discounted cash flow analysis that requires judgment in our evaluation of the business and establishing an appropriate discount rate and terminal value to apply in the calculations 
in selecting these and other assumptions for each business  we consider historical performance  forecasted operating results  general market conditions and industry considerations specific to the business 
it is possible that the assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner that impairment charges may occur 
we likely would compute a materially different fair value for a business if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change 
at december   net assets of our test measurement segment were million  including goodwill of million 
our test measurement segment reported an operating loss in and of million and million  respectively  primarily as a result of decreased product sales  cost and process inefficiencies on certain technical services provided by this segment and an unfavorable mix of technical service revenue 
a new senior management team was installed in for this segment and spending for sales  marketing  research and development were increased in to grow the revenue base and various organizational changes were made to improve the operations 
such investments yielded increased net revenue and gross margin in and continued improvements are expected in if continued improvement in our test measurement operations is not achieved and profitability deteriorates  we may be required to record an impairment charge to goodwill for the test measurement segment 
the recoverability of long lived assets is evaluated if impairment indicators exist 
indicators of impairment include historical financial performance  operating trends and our future operating plans 
if impairment indicators exist  we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets based on forecasted undiscounted cash flows 
if an impairment has occurred  the long lived asset is written down to its estimated fair value on a discounted basis 
the estimation of future cash flows requires management s judgment concerning historical performance  forecasted 
table of contents 
index to financial statements operating results  general market conditions and industry considerations specific to the assets 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgments in applying these factors to the analysis of long lived asset impairment 
it is possible that the assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner that impairment charges may occur 
we likely would compute a materially different estimate of future cash flows if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change 
reserve for excess  obsolete and scrap inventory we record inventory at the lower of cost generally first in  first out or market 
because of the stability of product costs in recent years  and the level of gross profit margins on most products  we have not made any material adjustments to write down inventory to market 
however  we do reserve for excess  obsolete or scrap inventory 
these reserves are primarily based upon management s assessment of the salability of the inventory  historical usage of raw materials  historical demand for finished goods  and estimated future usage and demand 
an improper assessment of salability or improper estimate of future usage or demand  or significant changes in usage or demand could result in significant changes in the reserves and a positive or a negative impact on our results of operations in the period the change occurs

the industrial group entered into new multi year contracts on december   may  and june  and  on each of the respective dates  acquired certain manufacturing assets from its 
table of contents 
index to financial statements customers in connection with the new contracts 
these contracts include two with dana for steer axle components  drive axle shafts and various drive train components for the light  medium and heavy duty truck markets and one with arvinmeritor for trailer axle beams and various drive train components 
the new contracts generated outsourced services revenue of million and million in the fourth quarter and full year of  respectively 
excluding the new contracts  the industrial group s net revenue increased million and million in the fourth quarter and full year periods  respectively  primarily due to a general increase in demand for medium and heavy duty trucks 
net revenue is expected to show comparable period increases during due to the three new contracts  additional business opportunities with existing customers and anticipated growth in the medium and heavy duty truck markets 
the aerospace defense segment derives its revenue from manufacturing services  other outsourced services and product sales 
manufacturing services revenue accounted for approximately and of total aerospace defense segment revenue in and  respectively 
manufacturing services revenue decreased million in primarily due to reduced program funding for federal government agencies  delayed shipments and contracts completed during the delayed shipments arose during the second quarter and are currently expected to be shipped early in during the fourth quarter of  manufacturing services revenue was million or of the full year  primarily due to increased volume on certain large programs 
manufacturing services in the first half of are expected to return to levels consistent with the comparable period 
other outsourced services revenue and product sales decreased million and million in  respectively 
the decrease in product sales is primarily due to reduced government funding for our customer s programs  which is not expected to increase significantly during the test measurement segment derives its revenue from technical services and product sales 
technical services revenue accounted for approximately and of total test measurement revenue in and  respectively 
technical services revenue and products sales increased million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in technical services revenue was primarily due to a large contract with a prime government contractor for testing services performed during  growth from calibration services provided under certain national customer accounts in and the full year impact of two calibration operations acquired during the second half of gross profit 
the industrial group s gross profit increased million in primarily due to the revenue growth from new contracts 
gross profit contributed by the new contracts was partially offset by manufacturing inefficiencies associated with disruptions in raw material and key components and capacity limitations associated with the increased demand 
the disruptions to production schedules related to the timely and dependable receipt of steel and components were present throughout  however  during the fourth quarter the industrial group s gross margin declined to and resulted in full year gross margin of as compared to in the factors impacting gross profit in the fourth quarter included excessive overtime to meet fluctuating customer demand  loss of days worked to conduct three physical inventories  cost overruns on a variety of new manufacturing cells  higher than expected training costs on new programs and increased charges to reflect the growing nature and complexity of the business 
an inventory adjustment of million was recorded in the fourth quarter comprised primarily of a last in  first out adjustment and production scrap 
also  labor and absorption variances of approximately million related to manufacturing inefficiencies were recognized and excess supply  tooling and freight costs totaling approximately million were incurred in the fourth quarter 
we expect that steel supply disruptions  manufacturing inefficiencies related to the start up of new programs  the installation of new manufacturing equipment and process development for the new manufacturing cells will continue to negatively impact gross profit through the first half of even with these production issues  the overall increase in sales volume attributable to the new contracts and the anticipated growth in the truck market is expected to continue to result in comparable period gross profit increases throughout the aerospace defense segment s gross profit decreased million in primarily due to lower margins associated with the decrease in product revenue 
product revenue declined for the fourth quarter and for the full year which resulted in a corresponding decrease in gross profit of million and million for the fourth quarter and full year periods  respectively 
the declines are primarily volume related  although competitive pricing pressure also began to impact profit margins during the second half of manufacturing and other outsourced services gross profit decreased million or in  primarily due to a revenue decrease of and an inventory write off of million in the fourth quarter related to a terminated contract 
gross margin

index to financial statements for the aerospace defense segment was in as compared to in the decrease in gross margin resulted primarily from the lower volume and related margins for product sales and the lower volume for manufacturing services 
the test measurement segment s gross profit increased million in primarily due to the increase in technical services revenue 
gross margin for the test measurement segment was in as compared to in the increase in gross margin resulted primarily from the higher volume for testing and calibration services and lower costs for products achieved through outsourcing certain product subassemblies 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million in and decreased as a percentage of net revenue to in from in the industrial group s selling  general and administrative expense accounted for million of the increase  primarily due to higher administrative costs related to additional infrastructure to support the new contracts in the industrial group and the overall growth of the business 
the test measurement segment also increased selling expense to support the national account opportunities for its calibration services 
research and development 
research and development costs decreased million in due to the completion of the first release of silver phoenix  a new data system product line within our aerospace defense segment 
the majority of research and development costs during were related to future releases of this product 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets increased in primarily due to certain identifiable intangible assets acquired in connection with the new industrial group contracts 
interest expense  net 
interest expense increased in due to an increase in our weighted average debt outstanding partially offset by a decrease in our weighted average interest rate 
our weighted average debt outstanding increased to million during from million during the increase in debt primarily related to the industrial group s acquisitions  working capital for the acquired operations  and capital expenditures to increase capacity and automation 
net proceeds totaling million from our public stock offering in march and april were used primarily to reduce debt and partially offset the increase in debt otherwise incurred 
the weighted average interest rate decreased to in from in our interest rate decreased effective with the july expiration of interest rate swap agreements with higher than market interest rates 
our effective interest rate is expected to increase in due to the issuance of senior notes totaling million in june and august at a weighted average fixed interest rate of and expected increased market rates under our credit agreement 
income taxes

net revenue in the industrial group increased million in primarily due to higher sales of light axle shafts and new components for medium and heavy duty trucks 
we began full production of light axle shafts under our contract with visteon during the second quarter of so benefited from the full year effect of this contract 
in  we began shipping to dana additional drive train components parts for medium and heavy duty trucks 

table of contents 
index to financial statements net revenue in the aerospace defense segment decreased million in primarily due to lower revenue from manufacturing services 
manufacturing services decreased million because certain contracts with aerospace defense customers were completed during which more than offset the revenue earned from new contract awards in and increased demand on certain other contracts 
net revenue from other outsourced services increased million in due to an increase in engineering services 
net revenue from product sales increased million in driven by higher quantities of data systems products  which benefited from higher spending by intelligence agencies 
net revenue in the test measurement segment decreased million in primarily due to a million decrease in product sales 
net revenue from technical services increased million in primarily due to an increase in calibration services 
gross profit 
gross profit for our industrial group decreased due to lower gross margins 
gross margins were lower due to equipment maintenance and efficiency issues for certain automated equipment and a higher concentration of lower margin class truck components 
the industrial group experienced a difficult third quarter in during which gross profit decreased million as compared to the third quarter of during the third quarter of  productivity for the industrial group decreased primarily as a result of the northeast electricity blackout in august and lower sales quantities to visteon and dana 
these lower sales quantities were driven by visteon s longer than normal annual plant shutdown and dana s rebalancing of inventory levels in anticipation of a potential labor related work stoppage 
our aerospace defense segment experienced lower gross profit from manufacturing services  partially offset by higher gross profit from products sales 
gross profit from manufacturing services decreased due to lower revenue and lower gross margins 
gross margins were lower primarily due to costs recognized during the third quarter related to warranty costs on an end of life program  expenses related to resolving technical problems on a custom manufacturing program and write off of program costs related to the termination of an unprofitable contract 
gross profit from product sales was higher due to the mix of higher value products and programs 
gross profit for our test measurement segment decreased primarily due to the lower volume in product sales 
gross profit from technical services also decreased due to a less profitable mix of business for calibration and testing services 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense decreased million in and decreased as a percentage of net revenue to from in we controlled our spending on selling  general and administrative in consideration of the increase in net revenue from to research and development 
the increase in research and development costs is driven by development of a new data system product line within our aerospace defense segment 
we expect to complete the development of these products in  and sold limited quantities in amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets increased in primarily due to certain identifiable intangible assets acquired during interest expense  net 
interest expense decreased in due to the repayment of debt and a lower weighted average interest rate

net cash provided by financing activities was million in as compared to million in we received net proceeds of million for our public stock offering of  shares of common stock that closed in march and april proceeds from the offering were principally used to reduce debt on our revolving credit facility 
we issued senior notes for a total of million in june and august through private placement transactions 
we had total availability for borrowings and letters of credit under the revolving credit facility of million at december   which  when combined with our unrestricted cash balance of million  provides for total cash and borrowing capacity of million 
maximum borrowings on the revolving credit facility are million  subject to a million limit for letters of credit 
the credit agreement includes an option to increase the amount of available credit to million from million  subject to the lead bank s approval 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be used to finance working capital requirements  acquisitions and for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures

our credit agreement was amended in march to revise certain financial covenants 
other terms of the credit agreement remained substantially unchanged 
our principal commitments at december  consisted of repayments of borrowings under the credit agreement and senior notes  pension obligations and obligations under operating leases for certain of our real property and equipment

index to financial statements at december   we also had approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future federal taxable income 
such carryforwards will increase future cash flows  if utilized  and reflect income tax losses incurred which will expire on december  we believe that sufficient resources will be available to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months depend on our profitability  our ability to manage working capital requirements and our rate of growth 
if we make significant acquisitions or if working capital and capital expenditure requirements exceed expected levels during the next twelve months or in subsequent periods  we may require additional external sources of capital 
there can be no assurance that any additional required financing will be available through bank borrowings  debt or equity financings or otherwise  or that if such financing is available  it will be available on terms acceptable to us 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
as permitted by sfas no 
 the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method could have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
on march   the board of directors approved a resolution to accelerate the vesting for underwater options as of march  in order to reduce future compensation expense related to outstanding options 
after amendment of each underlying option agreement  compensation expense to be recognized in the income statement over the next seven years will be reduced by approximately million 
forward looking statements this annual report  and our other oral or written communications  may contain forward looking statements 
these statements may include our expectations or projections about the future of our industries  business strategies  potential acquisitions or financial results and our views about developments beyond our control including domestic or global economic conditions  trends and market developments 
these statements are based on management s views and assumptions at the time originally made and we undertake no obligation to update these statements  even if  for example they remain available on our website after those views and assumptions have changed 
there can be no assurance that our expectations  projections or views will come to pass  and you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
a number of significant factors could materially affect our specific business operations  and cause our performance to differ materially from any future results projected or implied by our prior statements 
many of these factors are identified in connection with the more specific descriptions contained throughout this report

all additional borrowings under our credit agreement bear interest at a variable rate based on the prime rate  the london interbank offered rate libor  or certain alternative short term rates  plus a margin at december  based upon our leverage ratio
