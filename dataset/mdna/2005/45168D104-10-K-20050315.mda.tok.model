item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we operate primarily through three business segments the companion animal group cag  water testing business water and the food diagnostics group fdg 
cag is comprised of the following product and service categories rapid assays  instruments and consumables  laboratory and consulting services  pharmaceuticals  and information products and services and digital radiography systems 
water develops  designs  manufactures and distributes products to detect contaminants in water 
fdg develops  designs  manufactures and distributes products to detect disease and contaminants in production animals and food 
other items that are not included in our reportable segments are comprised primarily of corporate research and development and interest income 
we have conformed the financial information about segments for the year ended december  to our presentation of reportable segments for the years ended december  and previously we reported two operating segments 
additionally  we have conformed the discussion of cag results for and to the product and service categories we are using in as set forth in the table below 
for the three years ended december  revenues by product and service categories were as follows in thousands december  cag revenue instruments and consumables    rapid assay products    laboratory and consulting services    information products and services and digital radiography  pharmaceutical products    net cag revenue    net water revenue    fdg revenue production animal products and services   dairy testing products    net fdg revenue    net revenue    the following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business 
companion animal group in the cag segment  we believe we have developed a strategic advantage over companies with more narrow product or service offerings 
the breadth of our products and services gives us scale in sales and distribution  permits us to offer integrated disease management solutions that leverage the advantages of both point of care and laboratory testing  and facilitates the flow of medical information in the clinic by integrating practice management software systems with laboratory test results and in clinic test results from our idexx vetlab analyzers 
in the us  we sell instrument consumables  rapid assays and pharmaceuticals primarily through distributors  and  therefore  our reported sales of these products are sales made to distributors  rather than sales to veterinarians  the end users 
because distributor inventory levels and purchasing patterns may fluctuate  sales of a particular product line in a particular period may not always be representative of the underlying customer demand for the product 
therefore  we closely track sales of these products by our us distributors to the clinics clinic level sales  which we think provides a more accurate picture of the real growth rate for these products 
in the discussion of results below  we note certain instances where we believe reported sales have been influenced  positively or negatively  by changes in distributor inventories 
instruments and instrument consumables 
our instrument strategy is to provide veterinarians with an integrated set of instruments that  individually and together  provide superior diagnostic information in the clinic  enabling veterinarians to practice better medicine and build more profitable practices 
we derive substantial revenues from the sale of consumables that are used in these instruments 
during the early stage of an instrument s life cycle  we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements  while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placements begin to decline 
we have a large installed base of vettest chemistry analyzers  and substantially all of our revenues from that product line are now derived from consumables sales  although we continue to place instruments through sales and through rental and other programs 
our long term success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition  customer retention and increased customer utilization of those instruments 
to increase utilization  we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of blood and urine chemistry testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes 
we purchase the consumables used in vettest chemistry analyzers from ortho under a supply agreement that continues through this supply agreement provides us with a long term source of slides at costs that improve annually through  and also improve over the term of the agreement as a result of increasing volume 
under this agreement  we are developing and expect to introduce a next generation chemistry analyzer for the veterinary market based on the ortho dry slide technology  and ortho would supply us with slide consumables used in both the new instrument and the vettest chemistry analyzer 
we do not expect this next generation analyzer to be commercially available before our declining cost of vettest slides is expected to improve margins in our instruments and consumables product line beginning in in the fourth quarter of  we introduced the lasercyte hematology analyzer  which provides more extensive hematological diagnostic information than our original platform  the qbc vetautoread system 
a substantial portion of lasercyte placements have been made at veterinary clinics that already own our qbc vetautoread instruments 
although we have experienced growth in sales of hematology consumables  lasercyte consumable sales have been partially offset by declines in sales of qbc vetautoread consumables 
because the gross margin percentage of lasercyte consumables exceeds the gross margin percentage of the qbc vetautoread consumables  gross margin from hematology consumables is expected to increase with continued penetration of the lasercyte system 
our gross margins on lasercyte system sales have been low due to higher manufacturing  service and warranty costs associated with a new analyzer 
as we have gained experience with the analyzer  we have improved manufacturing efficiency and reduced warranty and service costs  which has improved margins 
while we expect that lasercyte margins will continue to improve  they will continue to have a negative impact on overall cag gross margins 
with all of our instrument lines  we seek to differentiate our products based on superior system capability  quality of diagnostic information  reliability  integration with the idexx vetlab suite  and customer service 
our equipment and consumables typically are sold at a premium price to competitive offerings 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to maintain a premium price strategy 
laboratory and consulting services 
we believe that more than half of all diagnostic testing by us veterinarians is done at outside reference laboratories such as our idexx reference laboratories 
we attempt to differentiate our laboratory testing services from those of our competitors primarily on the basis of quality  customer service and technology 
revenue growth in this business is achieved both through increased sales at existing laboratories and through the acquisition of new customers  including through laboratory acquisitions and opening new laboratories 
in february  we acquired a laboratory in columbus  ohio  in november  we opened a laboratory in seattle  washington  and we acquired vet med lab  which is based in germany and is the largest european veterinary reference laboratory 
profitability of this business is largely the result of our ability to achieve efficiencies from both volume and operational improvements 
new laboratories typically will operate at a loss until testing volumes reach a level that permits profitability 
acquired laboratories frequently operate less profitably than our existing laboratories and those laboratories may not achieve profitability comparable to our existing laboratories for a year or more while we implement operating improvements 
therefore  in the short term  new and acquired laboratories generally will have a negative effect on the operating margin of the laboratory and consulting services business 
rapid assays 
our rapid assay business comprises single use kits for in clinic testing and microwell based kits for large clinic and laboratory testing for canine and feline diseases and conditions 
our rapid assay strategy is to develop  manufacture  market and sell proprietary tests with superior performance that address important medical needs 
as in our other lines of business  we also seek to differentiate our products through superior customer support 
these products carry price premiums over competitive products that we believe do not offer equivalent performance and diagnostic capabilities  and which we believe do not include a similar level of support 
we augment our product development and customer service efforts with marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding our target diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing 
water our strategy in the water testing business is to develop  manufacture  market and sell proprietary products with superior performance  supported by exceptional customer service 
our customers are primarily water utilities to whom strong relationships and customer support are very important 
over the past several years  the rate of growth of this product line has slowed as a result of increased competition and market penetration 
international sales of water testing products represented of total water product sales in  and we expect that future growth in this business will be significantly dependent on our ability to increase international sales 
growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line 
most water microbiological testing is driven by regulation  and  in many countries  a test may not be used for regulatory testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body 
as a result  we maintain an active regulatory program under which we are seeking regulatory approvals in a number of countries  primarily in europe 
food diagnostics group production animal services 
we develop  manufacture  market and sell a broad range of tests for various poultry  cattle and swine diseases and conditions  and have an active research and development and in licensing program in this area 
our strategy is to offer proprietary tests with superior performance characteristics 
disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable  and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated 
in response to outbreaks  testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods 
conversely  successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products 
the performance of this business  therefore  can be subject to fluctuation 
in  approximately of our sales in this business was international 
because of the significant dependence of this business on international sales  the performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks described below that are associated with doing business internationally 
in  we received usda approval of our postmortem test for bse mad cow disease and  in february  we were informed that this test was approved by the european commission for sale in eu member countries 
while bse testing is very limited in the us  a significant market for bse testing exists in europe  and marketing and sale of this product will be a major priority for our production animal services business in dairy testing 
our strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop  manufacture and sell antibiotic residue testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements for testing of bulk milk by producers and provide reliable field performance 
sales of dairy testing products have declined over the last several years largely as a result of increased competition in the domestic market 
to increase sales of dairy testing products  we will need to increase penetration in geographies outside the united states and in the farm segment of the dairy market 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring and contingencies  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory our inventories include material  labor and overhead  and are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence when warranted by our estimates of future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those estimated by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which would have a negative effect on our results of operations 
as of december  and  our net inventories included million and million  respectively  of component parts and finished goods associated with our lasercyte hematology instrument 
in addition  we had firm purchase commitments for an additional million of component parts as of december  as of december  and  million and million of this inventory  respectively  required rework before it could be used to manufacture finished goods 
as of december   the inventory was net of a million write down for inventory estimated to be obsolete 
there were no write downs of this inventory as of december  for inventory estimated to be obsolete 
we expect to fully realize our investment in inventory and purchase commitments 
however  if we alter the design of this product  we may be required to write off some or all of the remaining associated inventory 
navigator is our pharmaceutical product for the treatment of equine protozoal myeloencephalitis epm that we launched during the fourth quarter of our inventories as of december  included million of inventory associated with navigator  consisting of million of finished goods and million of active ingredient and other raw materials 
in december  we entered into an amendment to our agreement with our supplier of nitazoxanide  the active ingredient in navigator  under which we paid the supplier million in january  and the supplier agreed until to replace any expiring inventory of nitazoxanide with longer dated material 
we believe that this agreement has substantially mitigated the risk that we would be required to write down nitazoxanide inventory due to its anticipated expiration prior to sale 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  the following significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  failure to obtain regulatory approval of certain products  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant increase in the discount rate assumed to calculate the present value of future cash flow  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant advancements or changes in technology 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based on a change in events and circumstances discussed above  we measure any impairment based on factors such as projected cash flows 
net intangible assets and goodwill totaled million as of december   consisting of million related to veterinary laboratories of which million represents goodwill  million related to production animal services of which million represents goodwill  million related to water testing products of which million represents goodwill  million related to pharmaceutical products of which million represents goodwill  and million of other of which million represents goodwill 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when four criteria are met 
these include i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the sales price is fixed and determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue at the time of shipment to distributors for substantially all products sold through distributors  as title and risk of loss pass to these customers on delivery to the common carrier 
we recognize revenue for the remainder of our customers when the product is delivered  except as noted below 
our distributors do not have the right to return products 
we recognize revenue on sales of instruments after the instrument is installed because installation is considered essential to the usability of the instrument  and the customer has accepted the instrument 
we recognize service revenue at the time the service is performed 
we recognize revenue associated with extended maintenance agreements ratably over the life of the contracts 
amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a current or long term liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from noncancelable software licenses and hardware systems upon installation of the software and completion of training if applicable or hardware and customer acceptance because collection is probable and we have no significant further obligations 
we recognize revenue on certain instrument systems under rental programs over the life of the rental agreement 
amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a current or long term liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition 
when instruments are sold together with extended maintenance agreements  we allocate revenue to the extended maintenance agreement under eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
accordingly  the total consideration received is allocated to the elements based on their relative fair values  which is determined by amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to other customers 
the deferred revenue related to the extended maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
the delivered elements are recognized as revenue when appropriate under the policies described above 
shipping costs reimbursed by the customer are included in revenue 
we record estimated reductions to revenue in connection with customer programs and incentive offerings  which may give customers credits  award points  which may be applied to trade amounts owed us and or toward future purchase of our products and services  or trade in rights 
we estimate these reductions based on our experience with similar customer programs in prior years 
revenue reductions are recorded on a quarterly basis based on issuance of credits  points actually awarded and estimates of points to be awarded in the future based on current revenue 
for the snap up the savings program  estimates of future points are revised quarterly and finalized annually in the third quarter of each year upon the issuance of points to customers 
for our practice developer volume discount program  we have reduced revenue assuming all points granted will result in future credits because we do not have sufficient experience with this program to estimate customer point forfeitures 
we may offer customers the right to trade in instruments for credit against the purchase price of other instruments acquired in the future 
for these trade in rights  we have reduced revenue using estimates regarding the percentage of qualifying instruments that will be traded in and the average trade in value 
in  we began offering guaranteed trade in values on current sales of our qbc vetautoread instruments  when the customer subsequently trades in the qbc vetautoread instrument for a lasercyte system 
to qualify for a guaranteed trade in value  the customer must trade in their qbc vetautoread instrument within five years of original purchase 
the value of the trade in depends on the amount of time from original purchase to trade in 
we have recorded a trade in reserve of million for these trade ins 
the maximum trade in liability at december  was million and we anticipate that we would receive equipment valued at million if all customers were to exercise their trade in rights 
we recognize revenue only in those situations where collection from the customer is reasonably assured 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we base our estimates on detailed analysis of specific customer situations and the percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
income taxes we account for income taxes under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

this statement requires that we recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable  respectively  and a deferred tax liability or asset  as the case may be  for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have recorded a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets that relate to state and international net operating loss carryforwards and certain other unrealizable international deferred tax assets 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
we consider the operating earnings of non united states subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states  the cumulative amount of which was million as of december  no provision has been made for united states federal and state  or international taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of non united states subsidiaries 
should we repatriate non united states earnings  we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings is made 
the recently enacted american jobs creation act of allows for a reduced rate of united states tax on qualifying repatriations of earnings held outside the united states 
we are currently studying the impact of this provision and we have not made a final determination as to the amounts  if any  that will be repatriated 
as such  the income tax effect of any repatriation cannot be estimated 
warranty reserves we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
our actual warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates or service costs differ from our estimates  which are based on historical data  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
as of december  and  we had accrued million and million for estimated warranty expense  respectively  including warranty reserves of million and million  respectively  for lasercyte systems 
warranty expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in warranty liability during compared to was due to the impact of the growing installed base of lasercyte systems  partially offset by a reduction of warranty cost resulting from our improved service experience for these instruments 
we charge warranty expense to the cost of lasercyte revenue at the time revenue is recognized on the system based on the estimated cost to repair the instrument over its two year warranty period 
cost of revenue reflects not only estimated warranty expense for the systems sold in the current period  but also any changes in estimated warranty expense for the installed base that results from our quarterly evaluation of service experience 
the reduction in estimated warranty costs per instrument resulted in a reduction of million in cost of product revenue for the year ended december  we sell extended maintenance agreements covering our instruments 
we anticipate that losses will be incurred for certain of these contracts and have recognized provisions for the estimated losses 
the anticipated loss reserves were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
estimates for certain claims we purchase insurance policies annually for individual and aggregate amounts of employee health insurance claims 
we are self insured for up to million per claim and up to an annual aggregate limit based on the number of employees enrolled in the plan per month  which was estimated to be million as of december  we estimate our liability for employee health claims based on individual and aggregate coverage  our monthly claims experience  the number of employees enrolled in the program  and the average time from when a claim is incurred to the time it is reported 
we purchase workers compensation insurance policies annually 
prior to january   we were fully insured for workers compensation claims 
beginning january   we purchased an insurance policy under which we are liable for the first million in claims per occurrence and up to an aggregate limit based on payroll  which was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
we entered into a similar policy effective january  we estimate our liability for workers compensation claims based on the insurance policy limits  claims incurred and the estimated ultimate cost to litigate and or settle the claims 
based on this analysis  we have recognized cumulative expenses of million and million for claims incurred during the years ended december  and  respectively 
periodically we are notified that a claim is being made against us 
we evaluate each claim based on the facts and circumstances of that claim 
if warranted  we provide for our best estimate of the cost to settle or litigate the claim and evaluate the liability recorded quarterly

revenue for cag increased million  or  to million from million in the same period of the prior year 
this increase resulted primarily from increased sales of laboratory and consulting services  and instruments and consumables and  to a lesser degree  rapid assay products  information products and services  digital radiography systems  and pharmaceutical products 
the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us contributed an aggregate of million  or  to the increase in cag revenue 
the increase in sales of laboratory and consulting services an increase of million  or resulted primarily from higher testing volume at established laboratories  mainly in the us and  to a lesser extent  in the uk and australia  the inclusion of sales from laboratories acquired in late and in  and  to a lesser extent  the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales at our laboratories outside the us and higher pricing 
growth in sales of laboratory services in will continue to be positively affected by the inclusion of results from vet med lab  a german veterinary reference laboratory that we acquired in november for  we expect incremental sales from vet med lab of million to million 
the increase in sales of instruments and consumables an increase of million  or was due mainly to increased sales volume  including higher domestic clinic level sales of vettest slides and  to a lesser extent  tubes used with our hematology instruments  as well as higher volume outside the us  the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us  increased instrument sales  due primarily to increased sales of the lasercyte hematology system  and the impact of changes in distributors inventory levels 
increased consumables sales volume was due primarily to an increase in our installed base of instruments during and shipments to distributors during the twelve months ended december  were reduced as a result of the company s continuing efforts to improve efficiency in the distribution channel 
the reduced shipments during had a positive impact on sales growth in the period 
the collective impact of favorable currency exchange and favorable comparisons resulting from lower distributor purchases in caused reported growth for to be higher than our estimates of the underlying clinic level growth of instruments and consumables 
the increase in sales of rapid assay products an increase of million  or was due primarily to increased domestic clinic level sales volume of canine and  to a lesser extent  feline products  as well as demand for our new snap test to screen dogs and cats for giardia infection  which was launched during the first quarter of  the impact of changes in distributors inventory levels  and the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us shipments to distributors during were reduced as a result of the company s efforts to improve efficiency in the distribution channel  which contributed to a reported sales growth in the period 
the collective impact of changes in distributor inventory levels and favorable currency exchange caused reported growth for to be higher than our estimates of the underlying clinic level growth of rapid assay products 
the increase in sales of information products and services and digital radiography systems an increase of million  or  resulted primarily from higher volume of complete system sales and increased hardware sales and placements of digital radiography systems  partly offset by lower service sales 
the increase in sales of pharmaceutical products an increase of million  or resulted in part from sales of new products launched in and for  we expect slower growth in pharmaceutical sales since we will not benefit from the favorable comparisons created by the and product launches  and no new product launches are planned for water 
revenue for water increased million  or  to million from million for the same period of the prior year 
the increase resulted primarily from higher sales volume and  to a lesser extent  the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us  partly offset by lower average unit prices due to price competition in certain foreign countries and higher relative sales in geographies where products are sold at lower unit prices 
the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us contributed an aggregate of million  or  to the increase in water revenue 
for  we expect slower growth in water sales due  in part  to increased competitive pressures 
food diagnostics group 
revenue for fdg increased million  or  to million from million for the same period of the prior year 
the increase was due primarily to the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us and higher sales volume of production animal diagnostics 
these increases were partly offset by lower average unit prices of production animal diagnostics and dairy testing products  and by decreased sales volume of dairy testing products 
the increase in production animal diagnostics sales was due to increased sales volume of livestock products outside the us the lower average unit prices were attributable to greater price competition in certain geographies and  to a lesser extent  to higher relative sales in geographies where products are sold at lower unit prices 
the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us contributed an aggregate of million  or  to the increase in fdg revenue 
for  we anticipate increased fdg revenue growth led by the launch of our herdchek bse antigen test kit  a rapid test for detection of bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse in europe and the full year impact of our acquisition in the fourth quarter of of dr

companion animal group 
gross profit for cag increased million  or  to million from million in the same period of the prior year due to increased sales volume across the cag product lines and to an increase in the gross profit percentage 
as a percentage of cag revenue  gross profit increased to from for the same period in the prior year 
the increase in gross profit percentage was attributable primarily to productivity improvements across cag product lines and services  the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies  net of foreign exchange hedge contract losses  and  to a lesser extent  favorable pricing from our supplier of slide consumables compared to the same period of the prior year 
the productivity improvements were partly due to manufacturing efficiencies and reductions in service costs related to our lasercyte hematology instrument and  to a lesser extent  to fixed costs spread over a higher revenue base 
the lasercyte service cost improvements generated a favorable change in our accruals for cost of product warranties and extended maintenance agreements for all placed instruments for which we have such future obligations 
beginning in  we expect cag gross margin percentage to be favorably affected by improved consumable costs under our supply agreement with ortho 
these increases in gross profit percentage were partially offset by a lower gross margin percentage recognized from laboratories acquired in  including due to the purchase accounting impact of writing off supplies and  to a lesser extent  by other laboratory service expansion costs  including start up costs of laboratories opened in the fourth quarters of and the greater proportion of laboratory sales  resulting largely from the acquisitions  relative to total cag sales may negatively impact our cag gross margin percentage as laboratory services generally have a lower gross margin than our product businesses 
water 
gross profit for water increased million  or  to million from million for the same period in the prior year  primarily due to increased revenue

food diagnostics group 
gross profit for fdg increased million  or  to million from million for the same period in the prior year  primarily due to an increase in the gross profit percentage 
as a percentage of fdg revenue  gross profit increased to from for the same period in the prior year 
the increase in gross profit percentage was attributable primarily to reductions in an accrual related to a third party claim resulting from the settlement of that claim and the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies  net of foreign exchange hedge contract losses  partly offset by unfavorable product costs 
the reduction in the accrual for the third party claim resulted in an aggregate benefit recognized in of million or a four percentage point increase in the gross margin percentage 
the unfavorable product costs were due to fixed costs spread over lower production volume in europe and  to a lesser extent  the impact of expensing a portion of the purchase accounting fair market value adjustment of inventory obtained in connection with the acquisitions 
we expect to incur integration costs in associated with the bommeli acquisition that will negatively impact our fdg gross margin percentage

operating expenses for cag increased million  or  to million from million in the same period of the prior year and were approximately constant at from year to year as a percent of sales 
the increase was attributable to a million increase in sales and marketing expense  a million increase in research and development expense  and a million increase in general and administrative expense 
the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from increased sales and sales support personnel and marketing program costs  the unfavorable impact of foreign currency denominated expenses  and  to a lesser extent  expenses associated with the vet med lab acquisition in the fourth quarter of the increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from increased staffing and higher spending to support instrument and pharmaceutical product development 
the increase in general and administrative expense reflects higher spending on information technology and other corporate functions  partly due to expenses associated with sarbanes oxley act compliance efforts  expenses associated with laboratory acquisitions in the first and fourth quarters of  including amortization of intangible assets  and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency denominated expenses  partly offset by the nonrecurrence in of expenses incurred in in connection with the write down of fixed assets associated with the discontinuation of development of a clinical chemistry instrument 
in october  we extended our relationship with ortho  the supplier of our vettest slides 
we committed to develop a next generation clinical chemistry system based on ortho s dry slide technology and discontinued efforts to develop the alternative system 
for  we expect cag operating expenses to increase as a percent of sales due primarily to the full year impact of sales and customer support personnel additions in the us  as well as similar investments we plan to make in europe  and to integration costs and intangible amortization expense associated with the vet med lab acquisition during the fourth quarter of  partly offset by a slight decline in research and development expense as a percent of sales as laboratory services  with its negligible research and development spending requirements  account for a greater proportion of total cag sales 
water 
operating expenses for water increased million  or  to million from million in the same period of the prior year and were approximately constant at from year to year as a percent of sales 
the increase was attributable to a million increase in general and administrative expense  a million increase in research and development expense  and a million increase in sales and marketing expense 
the increase in general and administrative expense reflects higher spending on information technology and other corporate functions  partly due to expenses associated with sarbanes oxley act compliance efforts  the unfavorable impact of foreign currency denominated expenses  and the impact of a gain from a legal settlement in that was recorded as a reduction to general and administrative expense 
there were no significant fluctuations in the nature and amounts of research and development expense or of sales and marketing expense 
food diagnostics group 
operating expenses for fdg increased million  or  to million from million in the same period of the prior year and  as a percent of sales  increased to from in the same period of the prior year 
the increase was attributable to a million increase in general and administrative expense  a million increase in research and development expense  a million increase in sales and marketing expense  and a million decrease in other income 
the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from ongoing expenses associated with the china joint venture formed in  higher spending on information technology and other corporate functions  partly due to expenses associated with sarbanes oxley act compliance efforts  the unfavorable impact of foreign currency denominated expenses  and expenses associated with the bommeli acquisition in the fourth quarter of the increase in research and development expense was due primarily to higher compensation costs for additional personnel  increased spending in support of our herdchek bse antigen test kit  and expenses associated with the bommeli acquisition in the fourth quarter of the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from increased spending in support of our herdchek bse antigen test kit and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency denominated expenses  partly offset by the nonrecurrence in of expenses incurred in in connection with the formation of the china joint venture 
the decrease in other income results from the nonrecurrence in of the reduction in an accrual related to a third party claim recorded as other income in for  we expect fdg operating expenses to increase as a percent of sales due to integration costs and intangible amortization expense associated with the bommeli acquisition 
other 
operating expenses for  consisting primarily of corporate research and development  decreased million  or  to million from million for the same period of the prior year 
interest income net interest income was million for compared with million during the increase in interest income was due to higher average invested cash balances partially offset by lower effective interest rates 
provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was for compared with for the majority of this rate reduction resulted from the resolution of an irs income tax audit through the year as a result of completing this audit  the company reduced previously accrued taxes 
other rate reductions resulted from the release in of a valuation allowance on international deferred tax assets as a result of a foreign subsidiary demonstrating consistent sustained profitability and changes in certain state and international tax estimates partially offset by revisions in to international tax estimates and a charge to write down fixed assets occurring in a high tax jurisdiction 
the increase in our valuation allowances from to was primarily related to the generation of state net operating losses that we believe are not likely to be realized 
the generation of state net operating losses increased our valuation allowance by million 
the reduction in valuation allowances from to was primarily related to releasing a valuation allowance that previously offset the international deferred tax assets of an international subsidiary 
this valuation allowance of million was released as a result of our determination that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the recently enacted american jobs creation act of allows for a reduced rate of united states tax on qualifying repatriations of earnings held outside the united states 
we are currently studying the impact of this provision and we have not made a final determination as to the amounts  if any  that will be repatriated 
as such  the income tax effect of any repatriation cannot be estimated

the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us contributed an aggregate of million  or  to the increase in cag revenue 
the increase in sales of our instruments and consumables an increase of million  or was due to increased sales of the lasercyte hematology system  which was launched in the fourth quarter of  partially offset by lower sales of qbc vetautoread systems  and increased sales of vettest slides and  to a lesser extent  lasercyte tubes  partially offset by reduced sales of qbc vetautoread tubes resulting from the replacement of qbc vetautoread systems by lasercyte systems 
the overall increase in sales of instrument consumables was due to the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us  the impact of reductions in distributors inventory levels in  higher volume outside the us and increased domestic clinic level sales

the increase was attributable to a million increase in sales and marketing expense  a million increase in other expense  a million increase in research and development expense  and a million increase in general and administrative expense 
the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from increased personnel and marketing program costs  increased costs to support the ramp up in lasercyte sales and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency denominated expenses 
the increase in other expense is primarily due to a million charge for the write down of production equipment purchased for the manufacture of consumables for use in an alternative clinical chemistry system as described above 
the increase in research and development expense resulted from increased staffing 
the increase in administrative expenses reflects higher spending on information technology and other corporate functions and an increase in bad debt provisions  offset partially by the elimination of certain expenses related to legal matters that concluded in water

the increase was attributable to a million increase in sales and marketing expense  a million increase in general and administrative expense  and a million increase in research and development expense  partly offset by a million increase in other income 
the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from increased marketing activities and headcount  and from expenses incurred in connection with the formation of the china joint venture see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the increase in general and administrative expense reflects an increase in administrative support expenses outside of the us  including support of the china joint venture and higher spending on information technology and other corporate functions 
the increase in research and development expense was due to new product development efforts  primarily related to products for diagnosis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies 
the increase in other income was primarily due to a reduction in an accrual related to a third party claim 
other 
operating expenses for decreased million  or  to million from million for the same period of the prior year 
the decrease resulted primarily from million in nonrecurring benefits provided in in connection with the retirement of our former chairman and chief executive officer in january  partly offset by corporate research and development hiring costs incurred in interest income net interest income was million for compared with million during the decrease was due to lower effective interest rates and the receipt in of million in interest on a domestic tax refund 
the decrease was partially offset by interest earned on higher invested cash balances

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb fin r 
fin r provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights variable interest entities and on the determination of when such entities are required to be included in the consolidated financial statements of the business enterprise that holds an interest in the variable interest entity 
this new model for consolidation applies to an entity in which either the equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in addition  fin r requires additional related disclosures 
certain disclosure provisions of fin r apply to all financial statements issued after january   the consolidation provisions apply to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date  and the remaining provisions  with the exception of interest in special purpose entities  apply at the end of the first fiscal year or interim period ending after march  to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  application for interest in special purpose entities is required for periods after december  the adoption of fin r had no material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  sab no 
which replaces sab no 
this staff accounting bulletin revises or rescinds portions of the interpretative guidance included in topic of the codification of staff accounting bulletins in order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and sec rules and regulations 
the principal revisions relate to the rescission of material no longer necessary because of private sector developments in us generally accepted accounting principles 
this staff accounting bulletin also rescinds the revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers document issued in conjunction with topic selected portions of that document have been incorporated into topic sab no 
also rescinds the accounting guidance in sab no 
related to multiple element arrangements as this guidance has been superseded as a result of the issuance of eitf the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be valued at fair value on the date of grant  and to be expensed over the applicable vesting period 
pro forma disclosure of the income statement effects of share based payments is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r is effective for all stock based awards granted on or after july  in addition  companies must also recognize compensation expense related to any awards that are not fully vested as of the effective date 
compensation expense for the unvested awards will be measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
we plan to use the modified prospective application method and to adopt the standard on july  we are currently studying sfas no

cash provided by operating activities was million during cash of million was generated from the income tax benefit obtained due to the exercise of nonqualified stock options and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options 
non cash expense of million was recorded from the provision for deferred income taxes primarily due to accelerated depreciation 
cash of million was used to pay vendor payables primarily due to ortho for vettest slides that were received in cash of million was used to increase accounts receivable due to higher sales

future operating results the future operating results of idexx involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this report 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report 
idexx s future growth and profitability depends on several factors the future success of our business depends upon our ability to successfully implement various strategies  including developing  manufacturing and marketing new products with new features and capabilities  including pharmaceutical products and a new clinical chemistry instrument  and improving and enhancing existing products  including the lasercyte system  expanding our market by increasing use of our products by our customers  strengthening our sales and marketing activities both within the us and in geographies outside of the us  developing and implementing new technology development and licensing strategies  and identifying  completing and integrating acquisitions that enhance our existing businesses or create new business areas for us  and reducing the costs of manufacturing our products and providing services through operating efficiencies 
however  we may not be able to successfully implement some or all of these strategies and increase or sustain our rate of growth or profitability 
idexx s markets are competitive and subject to rapid and substantial technological change we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services 
we expect that future competition will become even more intense  and that we will have to compete with changing and improving technologies 
some of our competitors and potential competitors  including large pharmaceutical companies  have substantially greater capital  manufacturing  marketing  and research and development resources than we do 
idexx s products and services are subject to various government regulations in the us  the manufacture and sale of our products are regulated by agencies such as the us department of agriculture usda  us food and drug administration fda and the us environmental protection agency epa 
most diagnostic tests for animal health applications  including our canine  feline  poultry and livestock tests  must be approved by the usda prior to sale 
our water testing products must be approved by the epa before they can be used by customers in the us as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the epa 
our pharmaceutical and dairy testing products require approval by the fda 
the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to similar laws in many foreign countries 
any failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements relating to the manufacture and sale of our products in the us or in other countries could result in fines and sanctions against us or removals of our products from the market  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we have entered into an agreement with the fda under which we have agreed  among other things  to perform specified lot release and stability testing of our snap beta lactam dairy testing products and to provide related data to the fda 
if the fda were to determine that one or more lots of product failed to meet applicable criteria for product performance or stability  the fda could take various actions  including requiring us to recall products or restricting our ability to sell these products 
sales of dairy antibiotic residue testing products were million for the months ended december  commercialization of animal health pharmaceuticals in the us requires prior approval by the fda 
to obtain such approvals  we are required to submit substantial clinical  manufacturing and other data to the fda 
regulatory approval for products submitted to the fda may take several years and following approval  the fda continues to regulate all aspects of the manufacture  labeling  storage  record keeping and promotion of pharmaceutical products 
failure to obtain  or delays in obtaining  fda approval for new pharmaceutical products would have a negative impact on our future growth 
changes in veterinary medical practices could negatively affect operating results the market for diagnostic tests could be negatively impacted by the introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services 
eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases 
such a decline could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
idexx s success is heavily dependent upon its proprietary technologies we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  trademark and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights 
if we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights  our business may be affected by competitors who develop substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us 
we cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents  that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid  or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies 
even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors  the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial  and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights 
in the past  we have received notices claiming that our products infringe third party patents and we may receive such notices in the future 
patent litigation is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict 
we cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case 
if we lose  we may be stopped from selling certain products and or we may be required to pay damages and or ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit 
any such adverse result could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
idexx purchases materials for its products from a limited number of sources we currently purchase certain products and materials from single sources or a limited number of sources 
some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary  and  therefore  may not be available from other sources 
these products include our vettest chemistry  qbc vetautoread hematology  vetlyte electrolyte  and vetstat blood gas analyzers and related consumables  digital radiography systems  active ingredients for pharmaceutical products  including navigator paste  and certain components of our snap rapid assay devices  water testing products and lasercyte systems 
if we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of these products in the future  we could face cost increases or reductions or delays in product shipments  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the slides sold for use in our vettest instruments are purchased under an agreement with ortho at fixed prices 
under this agreement we are required to purchase a minimum of million of slides through to the extent that slides purchased under the contract exceed demand for the slides  we may incur losses in the future under this agreement 
to the extent that we are unable to maintain current pricing levels on sales of slides to our customers  our profits on slide sales could decline because we purchase slides at fixed prices 
idexx s biologic products are complex and difficult to manufacture many of our products are biologics  which are products that are comprised of materials from living organisms  such as antibodies  cells and sera 
manufacturing biologic products is highly complex 
unlike products that rely on chemicals for efficacy such as most pharmaceuticals  biologics are difficult to characterize due to the inherent variability of biological materials 
difficulty in characterizing biological materials limits the precision of specifications for these materials  which creates greater risk in the manufacturing process 
we attempt to mitigate risk associated with the manufacture of biologics by utilizing multiple vendors  manufacturing some of these materials ourselves and maintaining substantial inventories of materials that have demonstrated the appropriate characteristics 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that biological materials that we maintain in inventory will yield finished products that satisfy applicable product release criteria 
our inability to obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
idexx s sales are dependent on distributor purchasing patterns we sell many of our products  including substantially all of the rapid assays and instrument consumables sold in the us  through distributors 
because significant product sales are made to a limited number of customers  unanticipated changes in the timing and size of distributor purchases can have a negative effect on quarterly results 
our financial performance  therefore  is subject to an unexpected downturn in product demand and may be unpredictable 
international revenue accounts for a significant portion of idexx s total revenue in  of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the us various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales 
possible risks include fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies  disruptions in transportation of our products  the differing product and service needs of foreign customers  difficulties in building and managing foreign operations  import export duties and quotas  and unexpected regulatory  economic or political changes in foreign markets 
prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the us due to competitive  market or other factors 
as a result  the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have a material impact on our results for that period 
in addition  many of the products for which our selling price may be denominated in foreign currencies are manufactured  sourced  or both  in the us and our costs are incurred in us dollars 
we utilize nonspeculative forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate foreign currency exposure  however  an appreciation of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we sell these products would reduce our gross margins 
the loss of our president  chief executive officer and chairman could adversely affect our business we rely on the management and leadership of jonathan w 
ayers  our president  chief executive officer and chairman 
we do not maintain key man life insurance coverage for mr 
ayers 
the loss of mr 
ayers could have a material impact on our business 
we could be subject to class action litigation due to stock price volatility  which  if occurs  could result in substantial costs or large judgments against us the market for our common stock may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations  which may be unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of their securities 
we may be the target of similar litigation in the future 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources  which could have a negative effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if our quarterly results of operations fluctuate  this fluctuation may cause our stock price to decline  resulting in losses to you our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors  including seasonality of certain product lines  changes in our accounting estimates  the impact of acquisitions  timing of distributor purchases  product launches  research and development expenditures  litigation and claim related expenditures  changes in competitors product offerings  and other matters 
similarly  our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to these and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
if our operating results do not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors in future periods  our stock price may fall 
future operating results could be materially affected by the resolution of various uncertain taxpositions  and adversely affected by potential changes to tax incentives in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and our income tax filings are regularly under audit by tax authorities 
management believes that it has adequately accrued for all potential tax liabilities and  although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals 
additionally  we benefit from certain tax incentives offered by various jurisdictions  some of which are scheduled to expire at the end of if we are unable to renew such incentives  the expiration of these benefits could have a material negative effect on future earnings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our financial market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we operate subsidiaries in foreign countries and transact business in local currencies 
we attempt to hedge the majority of our cash flow on intercompany sales to minimize foreign currency exposure 
see note m to our consolidated financial statements 
the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions 
corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity 
we primarily utilize forward exchange contracts with a duration of less than months 
gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of foreign currency from commitments or anticipated transactions are deferred in prepaid expenses or accruals and are included in the basis of the underlying transaction 
our hedging strategy is consistent with prior periods 
our hedging strategy provides that we employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that year  which is complete by the end of the preceding year 
quarterly  we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the following twelve months 
accordingly  our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle 
as of december   the company had million in unrealized losses on foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges recorded in other comprehensive income  which is net of million in taxes 
our currency rate exposure at december  consisted of local currency revenues and expenses  the impact of hedge contracts and balances denominated in a currency other than the company s or its subsidiaries functional currency 
based on our overall currency rate exposure  excluding unrealized losses of million at december  and million at december   a strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies would reduce operating income by approximately million for a strengthening of the us dollar from december  would have reduced operating income for by approximately million 
a weakening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies at december  would increase operating income by approximately million in a weakening of the us dollar from december  would have increased operating income by approximately million in as of december   a strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies  excluding the impact of hedge contracts currently in place  would reduce operating income by approximately million in  compared to million in  and the effects of a weakening of us dollar relative to foreign currencies  excluding the impact of hedge contracts currently in place  would increase operating income by approximately million in compared to million in
