item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis relates to factors that have affected our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the three years ended december   and this information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and the selected financial data included item of the form k 
herein we make forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including  but not limited to  those presented under cautionary statement regarding forward looking information on page company overview business strategy 
maximizing the value of our existing core assets is the focal point of our business strategy 
our core assets are our fully integrated upstream and midstream assets in the powder river and greater green river basins in wyoming  the san juan basin in new mexico  the sand wash basin in colorado and our midstream operations in west texas and oklahoma 
our long term business plan is to increase stockholder value by i doubling proven natural gas reserves and equity production of natural gas from the levels achieved in over a five year period  ii meeting or exceeding throughput projections in our midstream operations  and iii optimizing annual returns 
industry and company overview 
in north america  our industry has experienced several consecutive years of declining natural gas production 
most of the major gas producing areas  such as the gulf of mexico  are mature and are in production decline 
we are concentrating our efforts in the rocky mountain gas producing basins where there are estimated to be large quantities of undeveloped gas 
the us government largely retains the mineral rights to these undeveloped reserves  accordingly  the development and production of these reserves require permits from several governmental agencies including the blm 
we are well positioned for future production growth with a large inventory of undeveloped drilling locations in the powder river  the greater green river and san juan basins to meet the growing demand for clean burning natural gas 
in addition  our experience and technical expertise position us to acquire new opportunities to develop natural gas in the rocky mountain region 
our challenges will be to accomplish these goals with the difficulties encountered by the industry in obtaining the necessary permits from the blm  and state agencies such as the wyoming deq 
we believe that our technical expertise in developing environmentally responsible solutions to the problems encountered in the development of gas reserves will be a competitive advantage in overcoming these challenges 
our operations are conducted through the following four business segments exploration and production 
we explore for  develop and produce natural gas reserves independently and to enhance and support our existing gathering and processing operations 
our producing properties are primarily located in the powder river and greater green river basins  and the sand wash basin 
these plays are relatively low risk  multi year development projects 
these provide us with the opportunity to steadily increase our production volume over time at reasonable operating and low finding and development costs 
in our average production sold was mmcfe per day  which is a increase over the average production volume sold in we continue to seek to add additional upstream core projects that are focused on rocky mountain natural gas 
we will utilize our expertise in exploration and low risk development of unconventional gas reservoirs including tight gas sands  coal bed methane  biogenic  and shale gas plays to evaluate acquisitions of either additional leaseholds  proven and undeveloped reserves or companies with operations primarily focused in the rockies 
we may also evaluate unconventional gas reservoirs in areas outside the rockies where we can leverage our related exploration  production and gathering expertise 
in january  we opened an exploration office in calgary  alberta  canada to evaluate opportunities in the western canadian sedimentary basin 
through december   we have acquired the drilling rights on approximately  net acres in other rocky mountain basins and continue to expand our leasehold positions 
gathering  processing and treating 
our core operations are in well established areas such as the permian  anadarko  powder river  greater green river  and san juan basins 
we connect natural gas from gas and oil wells to our gathering systems for delivery to our processing or treating plants under long term contracts 
at our plants we process natural gas to extract ngls and treat natural gas in order to meet pipeline specifications 
we provide these services to major oil and gas companies  to independent producers of various sizes and for our own production 
we believe that our low cost of operations  our high on line time and our safety records are key elements in our ability to compete effectively and provide service to our customers 
our expertise in gathering  processing and treating operations can enhance the economics of developing new upstream projects 
this segment of our operations has provided a stream of operating profit that is available for reinvestment into other projects or other segments of our business 
overall throughput in our facilities during remained relatively constant as compared to and averaged a total of bcf per day 
transportation 
in the powder river basin  we own one interstate pipeline  migc  inc  and one intrastate pipeline  mgtc  inc  which transport natural gas for producers and energy marketers under fee schedules regulated by state or federal agencies 
marketing 
our gas marketing segment is an outgrowth of our gas processing and upstream activities 
one of the primary goals of our gas marketing operations is the preservation and enhancement of the value received for our equity volumes of natural gas 
this goal is achieved through the use of hedges on the production of our equity natural gas and ngls and through the use of firm transportation capacity 
we also buy and sell natural gas and ngls in the wholesale market in the united states and in canada 
these third party sales  our firm transportation capacity on interstate pipelines and our gas storage positions  combined with the stable supply of gas from our facilities and production  enable us to respond quickly to changing market conditions and to take advantage of seasonal price variations and peak demand periods 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  amounts in thousands  except per share amounts and operating data year ended december  percent change financial results revenues   gross profit   net income   earnings per share of common stock earnings per share of common stock diluted net cash provided by operating activities   net cash used in investing activities   net cash provided by used in financing activities   operating data average gas sales mmcf d   average ngl sales mgal d   average gas prices mcf average ngl prices gal net income increased million for the year ended december  compared to this increase was primarily attributable to higher product prices 
the price increases were somewhat offset by reduced operating profit from the marketing segment and after tax charges associated with a settlement with the commodity futures trading commission  or cftc  of million and the early extinguishment of long term debt of million 
additionally  the results included a change in accounting principle that resulted in a cumulative reduction of depreciation and depletion for periods prior to of million  net of tax  and the results included a million after tax loss from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle from the adoption of sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations on january  revenues from the sale of gas increased million to  million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in product prices  which more than offset a decrease in sales volume in average gas prices realized by us increased per mcf to per mcf for the year ended december  compared to included in the realized gas price were approximately million of gains recognized in related to futures positions on equity gas volumes 
we have entered into additional futures positions for a portion of our equity gas for see further discussion in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
average gas sales volumes decreased to  mmcf per day in from  mmcf per day in this decrease was the result of our reduction in third party sales volume due to the increase in product prices and related credit exposure 
revenues from the sale of ngls increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to this is primarily due to a significant increase in product prices as sales volumes were relatively constant 
average ngl prices realized by us increased per gallon to per gallon in compared to included in the realized ngl price were million of losses recognized in related to futures positions on equity ngl volumes 
we have entered into additional futures positions for a portion of our equity ngl production for see further discussion in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
average ngl sales volumes remained relatively constant in compared to product purchases increased by million for the year ended december  compared to the increase in product purchases in compared to was the result of an increase in product prices that more than offset the reduction in third party sales volume 
overall  combined product purchases as a percentage of sales of all products decreased to approximately in from in the reduction in this percentage is primarily the result of a decrease in the sale of third party product 
plant and transportation operating expense increased by million for the year ended december  compared to the increase was primarily due to a million increase in property tax expense  including approximately million for prior year property taxes in the state of oklahoma 
also contributing to the increase was increased fuel costs and compression rental expenses 
oil and gas exploration and production expenses increased by million in the year ended december  compared to the increase was substantially due to increased lease operating expenses  or loe  in the powder river basin coal bed development 
overall  loe averaged per mcf in compared to per mcf in the increase in loe is substantially due to higher water handling charges  contract labor  and fuel and operating costs of wellhead blowers in the powder river basin 
we expect the trend of increasing loe per mcf costs to continue in as water handling costs are being incurred on dewatering wells in several new pilot areas that have no offsetting gas production as yet 
depreciation  depletion and amortization  or dd a increased by million in the year ended december  compared to the increase is the result of additional capital expenditures and depreciation and depletion on our oil and gas assets 
in total  we had an million increase in dd a in our midstream operations primarily due to our expanding cbm gathering system in the powder river basin 
we also had million increase in dd a in our upstream operations primarily due to our continued development in the powder river basin  downward revisions to reserves in the powder river basin  and our october acquisition of producing properties in the san juan basin 
also contributing to the increase in dd a in our upstream operations was a change in our method of calculating dd a 
effective january   we redefined the asset groupings for the calculation of depreciation and depletion on our oil and gas properties from a well by well basis to a field wide basis for each of the jonah  pinedale and sand wash fields and to a grouping of all wells drilled into related coal seams for the powder river basin 
this change resulted in an increase in dd a of million in the change in the depreciation and depletion methodology is treated as a change in accounting principle 
accordingly  the accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization for these assets has been recalculated under the new methodology 
the cumulative effect of the change in depreciation and depletion methodology is a benefit of million  net of tax  and is presented in the consolidated statement of operations under the caption cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles  net of tax 
selling and administrative expenses increased by million in the year ended december  compared to the increase in selling and administrative expenses included a million settlement with the cftc in july associated with reporting price information to industry publications  and increased salary and benefit costs 
the total provision for income taxes  as a percentage of income before income taxes was approximately during the year ended december  as compared to in this increase is due to the settlement paid to the cftc  which was non deductible for tax purposes 
cash flow information 
cash flows from operating activities decreased by million in the year ended december  compared to this decrease was primarily due to the timing of cash receipts and payables and an increase in our inventory of products held for future resale 
cash flows used in investing activities increased by million in compared to this increase was due to an increase in capital expenditures and acquisitions in cash flows provided by financing activities increased by million in compared to this increase was due to additional borrowings to fund our capital expenditure program 
equity transactions 
preferred stock conversion redemption 
in december  we issued a notice of redemption for a total of  shares of our cumulative convertible preferred stock 
the holders of these shares had the right to convert them into shares of our common stock in lieu of receiving the redemption price in cash 
in january  we issued an additional  shares of common stock to holders who elected to convert their shares and paid  in cash proceeds to complete this redemption 
in march  we issued an additional notice of redemption for the remaining  shares of our cumulative convertible preferred stock 
in april  we issued an additional  shares of common stock to holders who elected to convert their shares and paid  in cash proceeds to complete this redemption 
after these redemptions  the cumulative convertible preferred stock was delisted from trading on the new york stock exchange and was deregistered by the sec 
common stock split 
on june   we completed a two for one split of our common stock  which was distributed in the form of a stock dividend 
shareholders of our common stock received one additional share for every share of common stock held on the record date of june  upon completion of the stock split  we had approximately million shares of common stock outstanding 
after the stock split  each share of common stock outstanding or thereafter issued includes or will include one half of a series a junior participating preferred stock purchase right 
we have restated our financial information to reflect this split for all periods presented 
other information price reporting to gas trade publications 
in  we learned that several employees in our marketing department furnished inaccurate information regarding natural gas transactions to energy publications which compile and report energy index prices 
we discovered the inaccuracies during a review of our marketing activities  which was being conducted in response to a subpoena issued by the cftc 
these employees identified inaccuracies associated with reporting of natural gas transactions primarily related to points in texas 
we have discontinued the practice of reporting pricing information to industry publications 
in conjunction with our investigation into this matter  we have taken appropriate disciplinary actions including the release of one manager in our marketing department 
in july  we reached a settlement of this matter with the cftc 
in conjunction with this settlement  we paid a civil penalty of million 
acquisition of san juan properties 
in october  we acquired oil and gas assets in the san juan basin of new mexico for approximately million  plus assumed liabilities 
the purchase included  gross acres  or  net acres  with approximately wells that were producing an average of mmcf per day  gross  or mmcf per day  net  of coal bed methane 
the purchase also includes approximately miles of related gathering systems  which are currently connected to our existing san juan river plant 
acquisition and disposition of gathering systems 
effective february   we acquired several gathering systems in wyoming  primarily located in the greater green river basin with smaller operations in the powder river and wind river basins  for a total of million 
several of the systems located in the powder river and wind river did not integrate directly into our existing systems  and accordingly these systems were sold 
during the year ended december   the income  if any  generated by the assets sold was immaterial 
acquisition of sand wash properties 
in august  through the acquisition of the stock of a private corporation for million  we acquired additional reserves  production and acreage in the sand wash area of the greater green river basin 
the assets of this private entity consisted primarily of the remaining interests in various sand wash properties that we operate 
this acquisition included approximately bcfe of proved reserves  mmcfe per day of production and approximately  net acres under lease 
segment information 
gas gathering  processing and treating 
the gas gathering  processing and treating segment realized segment operating profit of million for the year ended december  compared to million in the increase in operating profit in this segment in is primarily due to higher realized prices and improved contractual terms on gas gathered in the powder river basin 
year ended december  gross margin mcf operating expense mcf net margin mcf exploration and production 
the exploration and production segment realized segment operating profit of million in compared to million in the increase is due to an improvement in realized prices and an increase in the production of natural gas 
during  our production of natural gas as compared to increased by to bcfe 
the following table sets forth the average sales price received for our oil and gas products in the years ended december   and year ended december  average sales price oil bbl  excluding the effect of hedging positions oil bbl  including the effect of hedging positions gas mcf  excluding the effect of hedging positions gas mcf  including the effect of hedging positions production and other costs lease operating expense mcfe production tax expense mcfe gathering and transportation expense mcfe other expenses mcfe total costs mcfe the prices received for ngls are included in the price received for gas 
marketing 
the marketing segment realized segment operating profit of million in the year ended december  compared to million in the decrease in the marketing profit is primarily due to lower profitability in transactions associated with our firm transportation capacity from the rocky mountain region to the mid continent 
transportation 
the transportation segment realized segment operating profit of million in the year ended december  compared to million in the transportation segment includes the results from the migc and mgtc pipelines in the powder river basin 
the decrease in profit in this segment is due to lower interruptible transportation volume in as more gas was transported out of the basin through other pipelines 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  amounts in thousands  except per share amounts and operating data year ended december  percent change financial results revenues   gross profit   net income   earnings per share of common stock earnings per share of common stock diluted net cash provided by operating activities   net cash used in investing activities   net cash used in financing activities   operating data average gas sales mmcf d   average ngl sales mgal d   average gas prices mcf average ngl prices gal net income increased million for the year ended december  compared to the increase in net income was primarily attributable to a significant increase in gas and ngl prices in compared to this increase in prices was supplemented by increased equity production from the powder river basin cbm project and the greater green river basin 
partially offsetting the increase in net income in the year ended december  was a million after tax loss from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle from the adoption of sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations on january  revenues from the sale of gas increased million to  million for the year ended december  compared to this increase was primarily due to an increase in product prices  which more than offset a decrease in sales volume in average gas prices realized by us increased per mcf to per mcf for the year ended december  compared to included in the calculation of the realized gas price were approximately million of losses recognized in the year ended december  related to futures positions on equity gas volumes 
average gas sales volumes decreased mmcf per day to  mmcf per day for the year ended december  compared to this decrease was due to a reduction in third party sales volume resulting from the increase in product prices and an intentional effort to reduce related credit exposure 
revenues from the sale of ngls increased approximately million to million for the year ended december  compared to this increase is primarily due to a significant increase in product prices  which was partially offset by a reduction in third party sales volumes 
average ngl prices realized by us increased per gallon to per gallon for the year ended december  compared to included in the calculation of the realized ngl price were approximately million of losses recognized in the year ended december  related to futures positions on equity ngl volumes 
average ngl sales volumes decreased mgal per day to  mgal per day for the year ended december  compared to product purchases increased by million for the year ended december  compared to as a result of the significant increase in commodity prices 
overall  combined product purchases as a percentage of sales of all products remained relatively constant at approximately for both and plant and transportation operating expense increased by million for the year ended december  compared to the increase was primarily due to increased throughput at our facilities  the acquisition of several gathering systems in the first quarter of and additional leased compression in the powder river basin coal bed development 
also contributing to this increase were the fees paid to other companies  primarily rendezvous  for gas gathering services 
rendezvous is a owned entity that delivers gas to our granger complex 
rendezvous is accounted for under the equity method  and our share of its gathering revenues is reflected in earnings from equity investments 
oil and gas exploration and production expenses increased by million in the year ended december  compared to in our operating areas  the significant increase in residue gas prices in resulted in substantially higher severance tax expenses 
overall  lease operating expense  or loe  for the year ended december  increased by approximately per mcfe compared to and averaged per mcfe 
the increase in lease operating expense per mcfe was primarily due to unsuccessful well expenses of million in depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased by million for the year ended december  as compared to this decrease was the result of revisions to the operating lives  and salvage values  of our operating assets partially offset by increased production in the powder river basin and additional depreciation in from new projects 
the revisions to the operating lives and salvage values of our operating assets were the result of analysis performed in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
on january  and were treated as a revision of an estimate and are accounted for on a prospective basis 
selling and administrative expenses increased by approximately million in the year ended december  as compared to this increase was the result of higher compensation expenses due to an increased employee count in resulting from our growing exploration and production operations  and a modification in to our incentive compensation plan to pay this compensation on a current basis as opposed to a vesting schedule used in prior years 
also contributing to the increase were higher professional fees resulting from litigation concluded in and our ongoing research associated with the cftc investigation of our price reporting to trade publications 
partially offsetting these increases were fewer charges for doubtful accounts in as compared to in  in order to properly align our hedged volumes of natural gas to our forecasted equity production  we discontinued hedge treatment on financial instruments for mmcf per day of natural gas and  barrels per month of ethane 
as a result  a pre tax loss of million was reclassified into earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income 
cash flow information cash flows from operating activities increased by million in compared to this increase was primarily due to an increase in net income in compared to the prior year and the timing of cash receipts and payables 
cash flows used in investing activities increased by million in compared to this increase was primarily due to a higher level of capital expenditures 
cash flows used in financing activities increased by million in compared to this increase was due to increased cash flows from operating activities  which was used to reduce our long term debt 
other information acquisition and disposition of gathering systems 
effective february   we acquired several gathering systems in wyoming  primarily located in the greater green river basin with smaller operations in the powder river and wind river basins  for a total of million 
several of the systems located in the powder river and wind river basins did not integrate directly into our existing systems  and accordingly these systems were sold 
during the year ended december   the income  if any  generated by the assets sold was immaterial for separate presentation as a discontinued operation 
acquisition of sand wash properties 
in august  through the acquisition of the stock of a private corporation for million  we acquired additional reserves  production and acreage in this area 
the assets of this private entity consisted primarily of the remaining interests in various sand wash properties that we operate 
segment information gas gathering  processing and treating 
the gas gathering  processing and treating segment realized segment operating profit of million for the year ended december  as compared to million in the increase in operating profit in this segment in was primarily due to higher commodity prices  increased gathering volumes and the acquisition of several gathering systems in february exploration and production 
the exploration and production segment realized segment operating profit of million for the year ended december  compared to million in the increase in operating profit in this segment in was primarily due to substantially higher natural gas prices and production volume growth from the powder river basin cbm area and the pinedale anticline 
marketing 
the marketing segment realized segment operating profit of million for the year ended december  compared to million in the decrease in the marketing margin is primarily due to transactions associated with our firm transportation capacity from the rocky mountain region to the mid continent 
our firm transportation allows us to purchase gas in the rocky mountain region for resale in the higher priced mid continent markets 
in the second quarter of  additional transportation capacity out of the rocky mountain region became operational  which reduced the price difference between the two regions 
there is no assurance that the margins we realized on the sale of gas in will continue in the future  or that we will continue to originate the same amount of transactions in future years 
transportation 
the transportation segment realized segment operating profit of million for the year ended december  compared to million in the transportation segment includes the results from the migc and mgtc pipelines in the powder river basin 
the decrease in profit in this segment was due to lower interruptible transportation volume in as more gas was transported out the basin through other pipelines 
critical accounting estimates the application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as accounting rules have developed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an interpretation and implementation of existing rules  and the use of judgment  to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
we make every effort to properly comply with all applicable rules on or before their adoption  and we believe the proper implementation and consistent application of the accounting rules is critical 
for further details on our accounting policies  and the estimates  assumptions and judgments we use in applying these policies and a discussion of new accounting rules  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consultation with experts and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances 
however  actual results may differ significantly from the estimates used 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates will be recorded in the period in which the facts that necessitate a revision become known 
although there are a number of areas where we use estimates  what we believe to be the most significant ones are discussed below 
property and equipment 
depreciation on our property and equipment is provided using the straight line method based on the estimated useful life of each facility  which ranges from three to years 
useful lives are determined based on the shorter of our estimate of the life of the equipment or our estimate of the reserves serviced by the equipment 
among other factors  the estimates consider our experience with similar assets and technical analysis of the reserves 
the cost of acquired gas purchase contracts is amortized using the straight line method or units of production 
if the actual lives of the equipment or the reserves serviced by the equipment were less than we originally estimated  we may be required to record a loss upon retirement of a specific asset 
oil and gas reserves  properties and equipment 
we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activities 
developed and undeveloped leaseholds with proved reserves are depleted by the units of production method based on estimated proved reserves 
development costs and related equipment are depleted and depreciated by the units of production method based on estimated proved developed reserves 
the units of production method is sensitive to the determination of proved reserves 
to the extent the reserves are modified  the depletion determined under the units of production method will be increased or decreased on a prospective basis 
our reserve estimates are subject to numerous uncertainties inherent in the estimation of quantities of proved reserves  the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
the accuracy of these estimates is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
reserve estimates are imprecise and should be expected to change as additional information becomes available 
estimates of economically recoverable reserves and of future net cash flows prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times may vary substantially 
results of subsequent drilling  testing and production may cause either upward or downward revisions of previous estimates 
overall  during  and  we experienced downward revisions 
in addition  the estimates of future net revenues from our proved reserves and the present value of those reserves are based upon certain assumptions about production levels  prices and costs  which may not be correct 
further  the volumes considered to be commercially recoverable fluctuate with changes in prices and operating costs 
the meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based 
actual results may differ materially from the results estimated 
we estimate that a change in our reserves either upward or downward would decrease or increase  respectively  our depreciation and depletion on our oil and gas assets by approximately million 
asset retirement obligations 
we use significant judgment in estimating our future liability for asset retirement 
we evaluate each asset and in some cases individual components of assets to determine and estimate the future cost and timing of retiring those assets 
the estimate of the future cost is then discounted back to the present and recorded as a liability 
this liability will vary based upon the probability  timing and the extent of remediation necessary to reclaim those facilities  the discount factor used in those determinations and the projected costs of the remediation 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis and modify our assumptions as appropriate 
impairment of long lived assets 
if changes in the expected performance of an asset occur  or if overall economic conditions warrant  we will review our assets to determine their economic viability 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  assets are to be evaluated at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets 
accordingly  our review is completed at the plant facility  the related group of plant facilities or the oil and gas producing field or producing coal seam level 
in order to determine whether an impairment exists  we compare the net book value of the asset to the estimated fair market value or the undiscounted expected future net cash flows  determined by applying future prices estimated by management over the shorter of the lives of the facilities or the associated reserves 
if an impairment exists  write downs of assets are based upon expected future net cash flows discounted using an interest rate commensurate with the risk associated with the underlying asset 
this analysis is sensitive to  among other things  management s expectation of commodity prices  operating costs  drilling plans  production rates and the evaluation in determining asset groupings for which cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets 
during   and  we had no impairments of long lived assets 
identification of derivatives and mark to market valuations 
the determination of which contractual instruments meet the definition of a derivative under accounting rules is subject to differing interpretations as is the valuation of those derivatives 
management uses its judgment to analyze all contracts to determine whether or not they qualify as derivatives and to determine their value 
a specific area in which management s judgment is required includes identifying contracts meeting the criteria for exclusion from derivatives treatment  market liquidity  and market valuation 
this analysis is dependent upon commodity prices  outside market factors and management s intent upon entering into these contracts 
an analysis of the impact of the change in market prices on the value of our derivatives is included in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
recently issued accounting pronouncements 
we continually monitor and revise our accounting policies as new rules are issued 
at this time  there are several new accounting pronouncements that have recently been issued  but not yet adopted  which will have an impact on our accounting when they become effective in the following pronouncements have been issued but not yet adopted 
sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r  share based payment was issued in december and must be adopted no later than periods beginning after june  this pronouncement requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock based compensation 
we intend to adopt this pronouncement in the third quarter of currently  we are complying with the pro forma disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation which are included in note summary of significant accounting policies to consolidated financial statements 
we estimate that if we had adopted sfas no 
r for the year ended december   earnings per share of common stock assuming dilution would have been approximately per share of common stock or a reduction of approximately per share of common stock from the actual results for sfas no 
sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter was issued in november and is effective for us for inventory costs incurred in fiscal years beginning after june   and will be applied prospectively 
sfas no 
amends apb opinion no 
 chapter  inventory pricing to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of costs and the allocation of fixed production overheads 
we believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will not affect our earnings  financial position or cash flows 
sfas no 
sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
was issued in december and is effective for us for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june   and will be applied prospectively 
sfas no 
amends apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
the guidance in apb opinion no 
is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged but includes certain exceptions to that principle 
sfas no 
amends apb opinion no 
to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
we will adopt sfas no 
as required 
eitf no 
at its november meeting  the emerging issues task force of the fasb began discussion of issue no 
 accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty 
this issue addresses the question of when it is appropriate to measure non monetary purchases and sales of inventory at fair value and record them in cost of sales and revenues and when they should be recorded as an exchange measured at the book value of the item sold 
the eitf did not reach a consensus on this issue  but requested the fasb staff to further explore the alternative views 
the implementation of this eitf  if approved  may reduce revenues and related costs but will not have a significant impact on its net income  financial position or cash flows 
fsp fas a 
in february  the fasb staff posted its proposed staff position fsp fas a  accounting for suspended well costs 
at issue is the current requirement of sfas  financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies  to capitalize the costs of drilling exploratory wells pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves 
the capitalized costs become part of the entity s wells  equipment  and facilities if the well successfully located proved reserves 
however  if the well has not found proved reserves  the capitalized costs of drilling the well are expensed  net of any salvage value 
questions have arisen as to whether there are circumstances that would permit the continued capitalization of exploratory well costs beyond the one year limit specified in sfas other than when additional exploration wells are necessary to justify major capital expenditures and those wells are underway or firmly planned for the near future 
in its proposal  the fasb staff states that exploratory well costs could be capitalized beyond a one year limit if the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the entity is making progress assessing reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project 
comments on the proposed fasb staff position were due march  this fsp will be effective in the first quarter after it is approved 
we do not believe that this fsp will have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
american jobs creation act of during october  hr  the american jobs creation act of  the act was enacted 
it provides for certain additional tax deductions from qualified taxable income beginning in  subject to certain limitations 
although we expect that the act may result in a reduction in our effective tax rate  we have not yet determined the full impact of this law 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of liquidity and capital resources historically have been net cash provided by operating activities  funds available under our financing facilities and proceeds from offerings of debt and equity securities 
in the past  these sources have been sufficient to meet our needs and finance the growth of our business 
we can give no assurance that the historical sources of liquidity and capital resources will be available for future development and acquisition projects  and we may be required to seek additional or alternative financing sources 
product prices  hedges of equity production  sales of inventory  the volume of natural gas processed by our facilities  the volume of natural gas produced from our producing properties  the margin on third party product purchased for resale  as well as the timely collection of our receivables are all expected to have significant influences on our future net cash provided by operating activities 
additionally  our future growth will be dependent upon obtaining additions to dedicated plant reserves  acquisitions  new project development  marketing results  efficient operation of our facilities and our ability to obtain financing at favorable terms 
during the past several years  we have been successful in developing additional reserves of natural gas and increasing our equity natural gas production 
however  the overall level of drilling and production associated with our producing properties will depend upon  among other factors  the price for gas  availability of transportation capacity to market centers  the energy and environmental policy and regulation by governmental agencies  the issuance of drilling and water disposal permits  and the length of time for wells in the powder river basin to be dewatered  none of which is within our control 
any reduction in the levels of exploration  development and production by us or a significant reduction in natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
although some of our plants have experienced natural declines in dedicated reserves  overall we have been successful in connecting additional reserves to more than offset these declines 
however  the overall level of drilling associated with our plant facilities will depend upon  among other factors  the prices for oil and gas  the drilling budgets of third party producers  availability of transportation capacity to market centers  the energy and environmental policy and regulation by governmental agencies  the pace at which drilling permits are received  and the availability of foreign oil and gas  none of which is within our control 
there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in replacing the dedicated reserves processed at our facilities 
any prolonged reduction in prices for natural gas and ngls may depress the levels of exploration  development and production by third parties 
lower levels of these activities could result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our gathering  processing and treating services 
a reduction in any of these activities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we believe that the amounts available to be borrowed under our financing facilities  together with net cash provided by operating activities  will provide us with sufficient funds to connect new reserves  maintain our existing facilities and complete our current capital expenditure program 
depending on the timing and the amount of our future projects  we may be required to seek additional sources of capital 
our ability to secure such capital is restricted by our financing facilities  although we may request additional borrowing capacity from our lenders  seek waivers from our lenders to permit us to borrow funds from third parties  seek replacement financing facilities from other lenders  use stock as a currency for acquisitions  sell existing assets or use a combination of alternatives 
while we believe that we would be able to secure additional financing  if required  we can provide no assurance that we will be able to do so or as to the terms of any additional financing 
we utilized amounts available under the revolving credit facility together with an additional million borrowing under the master shelf agreement to redeem our million  senior subordinated notes in june  to pay a million prepayment penalty on this redemption  and to meet scheduled principal repayments during of million under the master shelf agreement 
we believe that amounts available under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet scheduled principal repayments during of million under the master shelf agreement 
we have effective shelf registration statements filed with the sec for an aggregate of million of debt securities and preferred stock  along with the shares of common stock  if any  into which those securities are convertible  and million of debt securities  preferred stock or common stock 
these shelf registrations allow us to access the debt and equity markets  subject to market conditions 
sources and uses of funds 
our sources and uses of funds for the year ended december  are summarized as follows dollars in thousands sources of funds borrowings under the revolving credit facility  borrowings under the master shelf agreement  proceeds from the dispositions of property and equipment  net cash provided by operating activities  change in balance of outstanding checks  distributions from equity investments  proceeds from exercise of common stock options  total sources of funds  uses of funds payments related to long term debt including debt issue costs capital expenditures  redemption of cumulative convertible preferred stock  preferred dividends paid common dividends paid  total uses of funds  capital investment program 
we currently anticipate capital expenditures in of approximately million 
the capital budget is an increase over the amount expended in this increase is the result of an expected increase in drilling activity in each of our upstream areas and additional drilling activity by third party producers whose acreage is dedicated to our midstream facilities 
overall  capital expenditures in the powder river basin cbm development and in the greater green river basin operations represent and  respectively  of the total budget 
due to drilling and regulatory uncertainties that are beyond our control  we can make no assurance that our capital budget for will not change or that we will actually incur this level of capital expenditures 
this budget may be increased to provide for acquisitions if approved by our board of directors 
the capital budget and our capital expenditures during the year ended december  are presented in the following table dollars in thousands

guarantee of fort union project financing 
we own a equity interest in fort union gas gathering  llc  or fort union  and are the construction manager and field operator 
fort union gathers and treats natural gas in the powder river basin in northeast wyoming 
initial construction and any expansions of the gathering header and treating system have been project financed by fort union 
this debt is amortizing on an annual basis and is scheduled to be fully paid in our requirement to fund under this guarantee would be reduced by the value of assets held by fort union 
this guarantee is not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
operating leases 
in the ordinary course of our business operations  we enter into operating leases for office space  and for office  communication  transportation and compression equipment 
payments made on these leases are a component of operating expenses and are reflected on the consolidated statement of operations and  as operating leases  are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
these leases have terms ranging from one month to ten years and the majority of the leases have return or fair market purchase options available at various times during the lease 
if we were to exercise the purchase options on all the leased compression equipment  these purchase options would require the capital expenditure of approximately million between and firm transportation capacity and gathering agreements 
access to firm transportation is also a significant element of our business strategy 
firm transportation ensures that our equity production has access to downstream markets and allows us to capture incremental profit when pricing differentials between physical locations occur 
firm transportation agreements generally require the payment of fixed monthly fees regardless of the quantity of gas that flows under a particular agreement 
these agreements are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
the fixed fees associated with our existing contracts for firm transportation capacity during will average approximately per mcf 
the associated contract periods range from one month to thirteen years 
under firm transportation contracts  we are required to pay the fees associated with these contracts whether or not the transportation is used 
firm storage capacity agreements 
we customarily store gas in underground storage facilities to ensure an adequate supply for long term sales contracts and to capture seasonal price differentials 
as of december   we had contracts in place for approximately bcf of storage capacity at various third party facilities 
firm storage agreements generally require the payment of fixed monthly fees regardless of the quantity of gas that is in storage under a particular agreement 
of the total storage capacity under contract  approximately bcf is under contract to our canadian subsidiary  wgr canada  inc  and western guarantees the subsidiary s performance under these contracts 
this subsidiary is wholly owned by us and fully consolidated in our financial statements 
the fees associated with these contracts in will average per mcf of annual capacity 
the associated contract periods at december  had an average term of months 
at december   we held gas in our contracted storage facilities and in imbalances of approximately bcf at an average cost of per mcf compared to bcf at an average cost of per mcf at december  these positions are for storage withdrawals within the next months 
at the time we place product into storage  we contract for the sale of that product  physically or financially  and do not speculate on the future value of the product 
these agreements for storage capacity are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
from time to time  we lease ngl storage space at major trading locations to facilitate the distribution of products 
at december   we held ngls in storage at various third party facilities of  mgal  consisting primarily of propane and ethane  at an average cost of per gallon compared to  mgal at an average cost of per gallon at december  long term debt revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility matures in june in december  the size of the commitment under the revolver was increased from million to million 
at january   million was outstanding under this facility 
loans made under this facility are secured by a pledge of the capital stock of our significant subsidiaries 
these subsidiaries also guarantee the borrowings under the facility 
the borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at eurodollar rates or a base rate  as requested by us  plus an applicable percentage based on our debt to capitalization ratio 
the base rate is the agent s published prime rate 
we also pay a quarterly commitment fee ranging between and  depending on our debt to capitalization ratio 
this fee is paid on unused amounts of the commitment 
at december   the interest rate payable on borrowings under this facility was approximately 
under the credit facility  we are subject to a number of covenants  including maintaining a total debt to capitalization ratio of not more than and maintaining a ratio of ebitda  as defined in the credit facility  to interest over the last four quarters in excess of to the credit facility ranks equally with borrowings under our master shelf agreement with the prudential insurance company 
this facility has been rated ba by moody s and is not yet rated by s p

these subsidiaries also guaranty the borrowings under the facility 
all of the borrowings under the master shelf agreement can be prepaid prior to their final maturity by paying a yield maintenance fee 
under our master shelf agreement  we are subject to a number of covenants  including maintaining a total debt to capitalization ratio of not more than and maintaining a quarterly test of ebitda  as defined in the master shelf agreement  to interest for the last four quarters in excess of to in december  we gave notice to prudential of our intention to prepay the million note due january  this note bore interest at per annum and was prepaid at par on january  to fund the prepayment  we issued a new million note to prudential  due january and bearing interest at per annum 
during  we will make scheduled payments totaling million on this facility 
we intend to fund these repayments with funds available under the revolving credit facility 
senior subordinated notes 
in  we sold million of senior subordinated notes in a private placement with a final maturity of due in a single payment which were subsequently exchanged for registered publicly tradable notes under the same terms and conditions 
the subordinated notes bore interest at per annum 
we incurred approximately million in offering commissions and expenses  which were capitalized and were being amortized over the term of the notes 
we redeemed the senior subordinated notes in june using amounts available under the revolving credit facility and an additional borrowing under the master shelf agreement 
in connection with this redemption  we paid a prepayment penalty of million and expensed approximately million of unamortized offering commissions and expenses 
covenant compliance 
we were in compliance with all covenants in our debt agreements at december  environmental the construction and operation of our gathering systems  plants and other facilities used for the gathering  processing  treating or transporting of gas and ngls are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  including those that can impose obligations to clean up hazardous substances at our facilities or at facilities to which we send wastes for disposal 
in most instances  the applicable regulatory requirements relate to water and air pollution control or waste management 
we employ specialists in environmental engineering  safety and regulatory compliance to monitor environmental and safety compliance at our facilities 
in addition  our environmental engineers and safety specialists perform in house audits of our existing facilities to ensure on going compliance 
similarly  prior to consummating any major acquisition  our environmental engineers perform audits on the facilities to be acquired 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable material environmental laws and regulations 
environmental regulation can increase the cost of planning  designing  constructing and operating our facilities 
we anticipate that the trend in environmental legislation and regulation will continue to be toward stricter standards 
the costs for compliance with current environmental laws and regulations have not had and  we believe  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we however cannot predict the extent or timing of future regulations or legislation and whether any such regulations or legislation will have a material adverse effect on the financial results of our operations  financial position or cash flows 
prior to consummating any major acquisition  our environmental engineers perform audits on the facilities to be acquired 
in conducting this audit on the acquisition of the gathering and processing facilities acquired in february  we performed phase one environmental assessments and  where conditions indicated  performed phase two assessments 
these assessments enabled us to satisfy ourselves that the disclosures by the seller were materially accurate and also to form our own risk assessment of potential environmental issues 
in relation to the assets purchased in the february acquisition  one of the sites was the subject of an administrative order between the former owner  the state of wyoming and a third party who has contracted to remediate the site in accordance with the administrative order 
as a result of the acquisition  we also became a party to the administrative order 
both that site and another site are insured under an insurance policy that was put in place by the seller for the costs of all remediation activities 
the obligation to perform and complete those remediation activities has been assigned contractually to a third party environmental specialist whose costs will be reimbursed by the insurance policy 
we are in the process of voluntarily cleaning up substances at several of the facilities that we operate 
our expenditures for environmental evaluation and remediation at existing facilities have not been significant in relation to our results of operations and totaled approximately million for the year ended december  in  we also paid approximately  in air emissions fees to the states in which we operate 
cautionary statement regarding forward looking information 
the private securities litigation reform act of the act provides a safe harbor for forward looking information made on our behalf 
all statements  other than statements of historical facts  which address activities or actions that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future  and growth of our operations and other such matters are forward looking terminology  such as may  intend  will  should  expect  anticipate  estimate  plan  predict or continue or comparable terminology 
this annual report contains forward looking statements relating to  without limitation  our future economic performance  plans and objectives for future operations and forecasts of revenue and other financial items 
forward looking statements made by us are based on our knowledge of our business and the environment in which we operate  but any one  or a combination  of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our projections in the annual report 
these factors  set forth herein and in our other documents on file with the sec  include our ability to expand our gathering operations  completion our budgeted capital expenditures  the success of our drilling activities  our ability to respond to competitive pressures  the composition of gas to be treated and the drilling schedules and success of producers with acreage dedicated to our facilities  the condition of the capital markets  uncertainties associated with ongoing and future litigation and legal and regulatory programs including those described under items and of our annual report on form k  in our quarterly reports on form q and in our current reports on form k and numerous other factors affecting our business generally and in the markets for gas and ngls in which we participate 
the forward looking statements speak only as to the date when they are made 
we assume no obligation to update and supplement forward looking statements that become untrue because of subsequent events 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our commodity price risk management program has two primary objectives 
the first goal is to preserve and enhance the value of our equity volumes of gas and ngls with regard to the impact of commodity price movements on cash flow and net income in relation to those anticipated by our operating budget 
the second goal is to manage price risk related to our marketing activities to protect profit margins 
this risk relates to fixed price purchase and sale commitments  the value of storage inventories and exposure to physical market price volatility 
we utilize a combination of fixed price forward contracts  exchange traded futures and options  as well as fixed index swaps  basis swaps and options traded in the over the counter  or otc  market to accomplish these goals 
these instruments allow us to preserve value and protect margins because corresponding losses or gains in the value of the financial instruments offset gains or losses in the physical market 
we also use financial instruments to reduce basis risk 
basis is the difference in price between the physical commodity being hedged and the price of the futures contract used for hedging 
basis risk is the risk that an adverse change in the futures market will not be completely offset by an equal and opposite change in the cash price of the commodity being hedged 
basis risk exists in natural gas primarily due to the geographic price differentials between cash market locations and futures contract delivery locations 
we enter into futures transactions on the new york mercantile exchange  or nymex  and through otc swaps and options with various counterparties  consisting primarily of investment banks  financial institutions and other natural gas companies 
we conduct credit reviews of all of our otc counterparties and have agreements with many of these parties that contain collateral requirements 
we generally use standardized swap agreements that allow for offset of positive and negative otc exposures with the same counterparty 
otc exposure is marked to market daily for the credit review process 
our exposure to otc credit risk is reduced by our ability to require a margin deposit from our counterparties based upon the mark to market value of their net exposure 
we are also subject to margin deposit requirements under these same agreements and under margin deposit requirements for our nymex transactions 
at december   we had million of margin deposits outstanding 
we continually monitor and review the credit exposure to our marketing counterparties 
in recent months the prices of natural gas and ngls  and therefore our credit exposures  have increased significantly 
in order to minimize our credit exposures  we have utilized existing netting agreements to reduce our net credit exposure  established new netting agreements with additional customers  terminated several long term marketing obligations  negotiated accelerated payment terms with several customers  and increased the amount of credit which we make available to substantial companies which meet our credit requirements 
although netting agreements similar to those that we utilize have been upheld by bankruptcy courts in the past  if any of the customers with whom we have netting agreements were to file for bankruptcy  we can provide no assurance that our agreements will not be challenged or as to the outcome of any challenge 
the use of financial instruments may expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances  including instances when i our equity volumes are less than expected  ii our customers fail to purchase or deliver the contracted quantities of natural gas or ngls  or iii our otc counterparties fail to perform 
to the extent that we engage in hedging activities  we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of favorable price changes in the physical market 
however  we are similarly insulated against decreases in these prices 
risk policy and control 
we control the extent of risk management and marketing activities through policies and procedures that involve the senior level of management 
on a daily basis  our marketing activities are audited and monitored by our independent risk oversight department  or iro 
this department reports to the chief financial officer  thereby providing a separation of duties from the marketing department 
additionally  the iro reports monthly to the risk management committee  or rmc 
this committee is comprised of corporate managers and officers and is responsible for developing the policies and guidelines that control the management and measurement of risk  subject to the approval of the board of directors 
the rmc is also responsible for setting risk limits including value at risk and dollar stop loss limits  subject to the approval of the board of directors 
hedge positions 
as of january   we have hedged approximately of our projected equity natural gas volumes and approximately of our projected equity production of crude oil  condensate  and ngls 
all these contracts are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges 
as such  gains and losses related to the effective portions of the changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
realized gains or losses on these cash flow hedges are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations through sale of gas or sale of natural gas liquids when the hedged transactions occur 
to qualify as cash flow hedges  the hedge instruments must be designated as cash flow hedges and changes in their fair value must be highly correlated with changes in the price of the forecasted transaction being hedged so that our exposure to the risk of commodity price changes is reduced 
to meet this requirement  we hedge the price of the commodity and  if applicable  the basis between that derivative s contract delivery location and the cash market location used for the actual sale of the product 
this structure attains a high level of effectiveness  ensuring that a change in the price of the forecasted transaction will result in an equal and opposite change in the cash price of the hedged commodity 
we utilize crude oil as a surrogate hedge for natural gasoline and condensate 
our hedges are tested for effectiveness at inception and on a quarterly basis thereafter 
we use regression analysis based on a five year period of time for this test 
in the first quarter of  we determined in our quarterly effectiveness testing that our hedges of equity butane production which utilized crude oil puts as a surrogate were no longer effective hedges 
therefore  in the first quarter  we discontinued cash flow hedge accounting treatment on these instruments 
the value of these financial instruments remained in accumulated other comprehensive income and was reclassified to our results of operations during as the underlying transactions occurred 
gains or losses from the ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized currently in earnings through price risk management activities 
during  we recognized a loss of  from the ineffective portions of our hedges 
outstanding equity hedge positions and the associated basis for the following table details our hedge positions as of january  in order to determine the hedged price to the particular operating region  deduct the basis differential from the nymex price 
the prices for ngls do not include the cost of the hedges of approximately  as of january  there is no associated cost for the natural gas hedges 
product year quantity and settle price hedge of basis differential natural gas  mmbtu per day with an average minimum price of per mmbtu and an average maximum price of per mmbtu 
mid continent  mmbtu per day with an average basis price of per mmbtu

rocky mountain  mmbtu per day with an average basis price of per mmbtu 
crude  condensate  natural gasoline  barrels per month with an average minimum price of per barrel and an average maximum price of per barrel 
not applicable propane  barrels per month with an average minimum price of per gallon and an average maximum price of per gallon 
not applicable ethane  barrels per month 
floor at per gallon 
not applicable account balances related to hedging transactions designated as hedges under sfas at december  were million in current assets from price risk management activities  million in current liabilities from price risk management activities   in deferred income taxes payable  net  and a  after tax unrealized gain in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
the unrealized gain in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to earnings in value at risk 
we measure market risk in our natural gas and liquid marketing portfolios using value at risk  or var 
we define var as a measure of the maximum expected loss over a given horizon under normal market conditions 
var does not explicitly indicate potential realized losses 
var does  however  implicitly indicate a firm s potential realized loss if market conditions were to remain constant or if the portfolio is liquidated within the specified time period 
our calculations are derived from financial engineering association s var works using the variance co variance method 
we assume a one day holding period with a confidence level 
there is a out of business days chance that the portfolio loss will be less than a specified amount if the entire portfolio were liquidated the next day 
as of december   our var position for natural gas and liquid marketing portfolios was  and the average for all of was  this figure includes the risk related to our entire marketing portfolio of natural gas and ngl financial instruments and the related underlying physical transactions 
we also measure market risk by sensitivity valuations 
as of december   an increase in natural gas prices of per mmbtu would lead to an increase in the fair value of our marketing portfolio of million and an increase in crude oil prices of per barrel would lead to an increase in the fair value of our marketing portfolio of  to the extent that a transaction is not fully hedged or there is any hedge ineffectiveness  additional gains or losses associated with the transaction may be reported in future periods

foreign currency derivative market risk 
as a normal part of our business  we enter into physical gas transactions which are payable in canadian dollars 
we enter into forward purchases and sales of canadian dollars from time to time to fix the cost of our future canadian dollar denominated natural gas purchase  sale  storage  and transportation obligations 
this is done to protect marketing margins from adverse changes in the us and canadian dollar exchange rate between the time the commitment for the payment obligation is made and the actual payment date of such obligation 
as of december   we had sold forward contracts for million in canadian dollars in exchange for million in us dollars  and the fair market value of these contracts was a loss of million in us dollars
