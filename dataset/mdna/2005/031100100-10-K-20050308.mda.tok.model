in  stroock stroock lavan llp billed fees to the company in the aggregate for services rendered of  critical accounting policies the company has identified its most critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management s judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ materially from the estimates used 
the consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to the company s accounting policies and to management s discussion and analysis 
the information that follows represents additional specific disclosures about the company s accounting policies regarding risks  estimates  subjective decisions  or assessments whereby materially different results of operations and financial condition could have been reported had different assumptions been used or different conditions existed 
primary disclosure of the company s significant accounting policies is in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenues in accordance with invoice terms  generally when products are shipped and services are rendered 
the policy with respect to sales returns and allowances generally provides that the customer may not return products or be given allowances  except at the company s option 
accruals for sales returns  other allowances  and estimated warranty costs are provided at the time of shipment based upon past experience 
at december   and  the accrual for future warranty obligations was million  million and million  respectively 
the company s expense for warranty obligations approximated million in each of the last three years 
the warranty periods for products sold vary widely among the company s operations  but for the most part do not exceed one year 
the company calculates its warranty expense provision based on past warranty experience and adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty expenses 
if actual future sales returns  allowances and warranty amounts are higher than past experience  additional warranty accruals may be required 
inventories 
the company uses the last in  first out lifo method of accounting for more than half of its inventories  whereby inventories reported on its balance sheet are conservatively valued

goodwill 
the company accounts for goodwill under statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill is not amortized  rather  it is tested for impairment at least annually 
as required by sfas no 
 the company ceased amortization of all goodwill as of january  sfas no 
requires a two step impairment test for goodwill 
the first step is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit s assets to the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further evaluation is required and no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then the second step must be completed  which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability  with the excess being implied goodwill 
an impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill 
the company would be required to record such impairment losses 
the determination of the fair value of the company s reporting units is based  among other things  on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit being valued 
changes in interest rates and market conditions  among other factors  may have an impact on these estimates 
the company s acquisitions have generally included a large goodwill component and the company expects to continue to make acquisitions 
at december   goodwill totaled million or of the company s total assets

ametek accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
the most significant elements in determining the company s pension income or expense are the assumed pension liability discount rate and the expected return on plan assets 
the pension discount rate reflects the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be settled at the year end valuation date 
at the end of each year  the company determines the assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities 
in estimating this rate  the company looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments 
the discount rate used in determining the pension cost was for us defined benefit pension plans 
the discount rate used for determining the funded status of the plans at december   and determining the us defined benefit pension plan cost is 
the company used an expected long term rate of return on plan assets for us defined benefit pension plans for of  and will use a rate of for the rate of compensation increase used in determining the and pension expense for these plans was 
the unrecognized pension loss  which results from the net effect of changes in the assumed discount rate  the effect of differences between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets  and other changes in actuarial assumptions  has been deferred and is subject to amortization over the estimated service periods of the participants 
the unrecognized pension loss totaled million for us defined benefit pension plans at december   compared with million at december  based on future actuarial assumptions  this deferred loss could possibly affect future pension costs

a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against the amount due from these customers 
for all other customers  the company recognizes reserves for bad debts based on the length of time specific receivables are past due based on its historical experience 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for possible losses on receivables at december  was million  compared with million at december  new accounting standards in the first quarter of  the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb financial interpretation no 
r fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 which replaced fin fin r requires a company to consolidate a variable interest entity vie if it is designated as a primary beneficiary of that entity even if the company does not have a majority voting interest in the entity 
a vie is generally defined as an entity in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest  or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its own activities without additional financial support from other parties  or whose owners lack the risks and rewards of ownership 
the disclosure requirements of fin r were effective for financial statements issued after december  the initial recognition provisions of fin r relating to vie s created or obtained prior to february were to be implemented no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after march  adoption of fin r had no effect on the company s consolidated results of operations  financial position  or cash flows

the impact of adopting sfas no 
r cannot be completely predicted at this time because it will depend on  among other things  the level of share based payments granted in the future 
the company is still assessing the effect of adopting sfas no 
r and the appropriate transition method 
also  the company has not determined whether the adoption of sfas no 
r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas no  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements

included in the amounts above are net expenses for research and development of million for  million for  and million for environmental matters certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by products as defined by federal and state laws and regulations 
while these waste products were handled in compliance with regulations existing at that time  the company has been named a potentially responsible party prp regarding waste remediation at several non ametek sites that are the subject of government mandated cleanups 
in addition to these non ametek sites  the company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its manufacturing locations and for claims and proceedings against the company with respect to other environmental matters once the company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable

under certain of the agreements the former or new owners retained  or assumed and agreed to indemnify the company against  certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances 
the company and some of the other parties carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters 
to date  those parties have met their obligations in all material respects 
the company has no reason to believe that such third parties would fail to perform their obligations in the future 
however  if the company were required to record a liability with respect to all  or a portion of  such matters on its balance sheet  the effect on income and the amount of the liability would not be significant 
in the opinion of management  based upon presently available information and past experience related to such matters  either adequate provision for probable costs has been made  or the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows of the company 
market risk the company s primary exposures to market risk are fluctuations in interest rates on its short term and long term debt  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices for certain raw material purchases 
all of the company s long term debt carries fixed rates and its short term debt is variable rate debt 
these financial instruments are more fully described in the notes to the financial statements 
the foreign currencies to which the company has the most significant exchange rate exposure include the euro  the british pound  the mexican peso and the japanese yen 
exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is monitored  and when possible  mitigated through the occasional use of derivative financial instruments  and use of local borrowings in the foreign country affected
