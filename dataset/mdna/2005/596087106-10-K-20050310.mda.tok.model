item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
as a result of many factors  such as those set forth under the forward looking statements and factors that may affect our business sections in part  item and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
our business advancis pharmaceutical corporation was incorporated in delaware in december and commenced operations on january  we are a pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing pulsatile drug products that fulfill unmet medical needs in the treatment of infectious disease 
we are developing a broad portfolio of drugs based on the novel biological finding that bacteria exposed to antibiotics in front loaded  sequential bursts  or pulses  are killed more efficiently than those exposed to standard antibiotic treatment regimens 
we currently have issued us patents covering our proprietary once a day pulsatile delivery technology called pulsys 
we have initially focused on developing pulsatile formulations of approved and marketed drugs that no longer have patent protection or that have patents expiring in the next three years 
our lead pulsatile product candidates  based on the antibiotic amoxicillin  are currently under evaluation in two separate phase iii clinical trials 
we also have an additional four pulsatile drugs or drug product combination candidates in preclinical development 
at the end of the second quarter of  we acquired the us rights to keflex cephalexin from eli lilly 
we currently employ a small sales and marketing staff that is promoting keflex products to national accounts 
in support of the introduction of our first anticipated pulsatile product  amoxicillin pulsys  we intend to develop our own sales and marketing capabilities 
we will target high volume prescribers  such as family practitioners and internists  and over time expand our internal sales and marketing capabilities through third party collaborations 
management review of and focus for the year ended december  was advancis first full year as a public company  following our initial public offering on october  the following is a summary of key events that occurred during the year 
pulsys product development and collaborations our current focus is on the successful development and commercialization of our pulsatile product candidates  initially amoxicillin pulsys 
in may  we entered into a collaboration agreement with par pharmaceutical companies  inc par to develop and commercialize a pulsatile amoxicillin product for pharyngitis tonsillitis and  subsequently  an amoxicillin clavulanate combination pulsys product for acute otitis media 
under this agreement  we received an upfront payment of million and a commitment from par to fund future product development expenses 
our phase iii program to support regulatory approvals for our adult and pediatric amoxicillin pulsys products began in we selected an amoxicillin formulation for testing  held pre phase iii meetings with the fda in september and december  and initiated dosing in october for our adolescent and adult trial 
we began the enrollment for our pediatric phase iii trial in january a number of preclinical studies were conducted in  and an amoxicillin and clarithromycin study supporting the efficiency of our once daily pulsatile dosing approach was published in a december industry journal 
during  we received cash of million from our collaboration partners  consisting of million from glaxosmithkline gsk for a milestone achievement for which the revenue was reported in the fourth quarter of  million from par for the upfront payment for the amoxicillin collaboration  and million from par for quarterly funding payments under the amoxicillin pulsys collaboration 
we recognized revenue of approximately million in resulting from the cash receipts of million 
marketed products during  we evaluated a number of products for possible acquisition that would be consistent with our philosophy of focusing on currently marketed drug products that we may be able to improve potential using our pulsatile dosing approach 
at the end of the second quarter of  we acquired the keflex brand of cephalexin 
cephalexin had retail sales of million in  on a prescription base of million 
on june   we acquired the keflex brand from eli lilly for million  and commenced product sales 
in the second half of  we recorded net keflex product sales of million 
in december  we entered into an agreement for the future supply of keflex with ceph international corporation in puerto rico 
this agreement provides us with a long term availability of keflex manufacturing capacity and replaces the short term  transitional supply agreement that we had with lilly 
we began pre clinical work on a once daily version of keflex pulsys and also began development of additional non pulsys keflex products for potential sale in other events in in  we continued to build our senior management and hired a number of key personnel 
these executives included a chief scientific officer  a senior vice president of technical operations and a vice president of discovery 
in addition to expanding our staff in  we also expanded our research capabilities by leasing additional office and laboratory facilities 
on october   gsk notified us that they were terminating our collaboration for amoxicillin clavulanate augmentin  under which we had licensed patents and pulsys technology to them for their own clinical development efforts 
gsk s continued development efforts could have resulted in additional milestone and royalty revenue to us  however  we believe that pulsatile amoxicillin clavulanate remains technically and commercially viable 
in december  we announced that our amoxicillin collaboration with par was revised to include the development of an amoxicillin clavulanate pulsys product for the treatment of otitis media 
during  we continued to develop our generic formulation of abbott laboratories biaxin xl clarithromycin extended release tablets 
we adjusted our formulations of the product to modify the release profile to more closely correspond to biaxin xl and meet the standard for bioequivalence 
however  both of the formulations missed the peak concentration required to achieve bioequivalence  and we decided to end further development of this product 
this was a non core product which did not use our pulsys technology  and due to the addition of other competitors with similar generic product candidates nearing release  made generic clarithromycin a less attractive development opportunity 
in november we implemented steps to reduce our expenses  as a result of the unexpected gsk termination and the discontinuance of our generic biaxin xl program 
these steps included a decision to forego certain discretionary expenditures  a work force reduction of approximately percent  and efforts to focus our resources on our most promising product candidates 
we expect these actions will result in our current funds  together with funds expected from existing collaborations and keflex product sales  will be adequate to support our existing operations through at least early focus for our primary focus for and is to fully develop and commercialize our amoxicillin pulsys product candidates  which are currently in phase iii trials for pharyngitis tonsillitis 
we intend to develop an additional amoxicillin clavulanate pulsys product candidate to address pediatric otitis media 
we also intend to focus our development efforts on a pulsys version of keflex  beginning with phase i ii clinical trials expected in in addition  we expect to continue the evaluation of our preclinical product candidates 
research and development expenses we expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to develop our product candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  fees paid to professional service providers in conjunction with independently monitoring our clinical trials and acquiring and evaluating data in conjunction with our clinical trials  costs of contract manufacturing services  costs of materials used in clinical trials and research and development  depreciation of capital resources used to develop our products  costs of facilities and the legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
we believe that significant investment in product development is a competitive necessity and plan to continue these investments in order to be in a position to realize the potential of our product candidates and proprietary technologies 
we expect to incur licensing costs in the future that could be substantial  as we increase our efforts to license existing product candidates 
the following table summarizes research and development expense for our product development initiatives for the fiscal years ended december   and see our product pipeline above for our current priority product candidates

we record direct costs  including personnel costs and related benefits and stock based compensation  on a project by project basis 
we record indirect costs that support a number of our research and development activities in the aggregate 
we have both pediatric and adult amoxicillin formulations in clinical development 
we have entered into an agreement under which par pharmaceutical will be responsible for funding the anticipated future development costs of this product 
see our collaboration with par pharmaceutical for amoxicillin pulsys above 
phase iii dosing for the adolescent adult formulation commenced october  and dosing for the pediatric formulation commenced on january  we entered into an agreement under which glaxosmithkline gsk was responsible for funding future clinical development of this product 
gsk has notified us that  effective december   it would discontinue its development efforts for this product

stock based compensation employees 
we have recorded deferred stock based compensation expense in connection with the grant of certain stock options to employees 
deferred stock based compensation for options granted to employees is the difference between the fair value for financial reporting purposes of our common stock on the date such options were granted and their exercise price 
in accordance with apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  these amounts were recorded as a component of stockholders equity deficit and are being amortized as charges to operations over the vesting periods of the options

 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
we recognize an expense for such options throughout the vesting period as the services are provided by the non employee consultants and sab members

for the options granted to a non employee consultant for past services  we recorded a one time stock based compensation charge of  in beneficial conversion feature in march  we issued convertible notes to certain existing investors for an aggregate of million 
the notes and accrued interest were converted into  shares of series e mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock in july  at a price which was lower than the estimated fair value of our common stock at the date of the issuance of the notes 
as a result  we recorded a beneficial conversion charge in the form of deemed interest of approximately million 
in july  we completed the sale of  shares of series e mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock 
we determined that the issuance resulted in a beneficial conversion feature calculated in accordance with eitf  application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments 
as a result  we recorded a beneficial conversion charge in the form of deemed dividends of approximately of million 
all of our outstanding series e convertible preferred stock was converted into common stock upon the closing of an initial public offering 
interest income expense interest income consists of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities

net losses we have a limited history of operations 
we anticipate that our results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including payments made or received pursuant to licensing or collaboration agreements  progress of our research and development efforts  and the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals 
our limited operating history makes predictions of future operations difficult or impossible 
since our inception  we have incurred significant losses

if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs  reduce our commercialization efforts or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently

recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 as revised 
fin r requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the company has adopted fin r and has determined that it does not currently hold interests in any entities that are subject to the consolidation provisions of this interpretation 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  share based payment  a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r requires public companies to recognize expense associated with share based compensation arrangements  including employee stock options  using a fair value based option pricing model  and eliminates the alternative to use opinion s intrinsic value method of accounting for share based payments 
in accordance with the new pronouncement  the company plans to begin recognizing the expense associated with its share based payments  as determined using a fair value based method  in its statement of operations beginning on july  adoption of the expense provisions of sfas r are expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
the standard allows three alternative transition methods for public companies modified prospective application without restatement of prior interim periods in the year of adoption  modified prospective application with restatement of prior interim periods in the year of adoption  and retroactive application with restatement of prior financial statements to include the same amounts that were previously included in pro forma disclosures 
the company has not determined which transition method it will adopt 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  exchange of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
sfas is based on the principle that exchange of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair market value of the assets exchanged 
sfas eliminates the exception of nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
sfas is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges in fiscal periods beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the provisions of sfas and do not believe that its adoption will have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to accrued expenses  fair valuation of stock related to stock based compensation and income taxes 
we based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue for the sale of pharmaceutical products and for payments received under collaboration agreements for licensing  milestones  and reimbursement of development costs 
product sales 
revenue from product sales  net of estimated provisions  is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably probable 
our customers consist primarily of large pharmaceutical wholesalers who sell directly into the retail channel 
provisions for sales discounts  and estimates for chargebacks  rebates  and product returns are established as a reduction of product sales revenue at the time revenues are recognized  based on historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact these reserves 
these revenue reductions are generally reflected either as a direct reduction to accounts receivable through an allowance  or as an addition to accrued expenses if the payment is due to a party other than the wholesaler 
chargebacks and rebates are based on the difference between the prices at which we sell our products to wholesalers and the sales price ultimately paid under fixed price contracts by third party payers  including governmental agencies 
we record an estimate at the time of sale to the wholesaler of the amount to be charged back to us or rebated to the end user 
we have recorded reserves for chargebacks and rebates based upon various factors  including current contract prices  historical trends  and our future expectations 
the amount of actual chargebacks and rebates claimed could be either higher or lower than the amounts we accrued 
changes in our estimates would be recorded in the income statement in the period of the change 
product returns 
in the pharmaceutical industry  customers are normally granted the right to return product for a refund if the product has not been used prior to its expiration date  which for our keflex product is typically three years from the date of manufacture 
our return policy typically allows product returns for products within an eighteen month window from six months prior to the expiration date and up to twelve months after the expiration date 
we estimate the level of sales which will ultimately be returned pursuant to our return policy  and record a related reserve at the time of sale 
these amounts are deducted from our gross sales to determine our net revenues 
our estimates take into consideration historical returns of our products and our future expectations 
we periodically review the reserves established for returns and adjust them based on actual experience 
the amount of actual product return could be either higher or lower than the amounts we accrued 
changes in our estimates would be recorded in the income statement in the period of the change 
if we over or under estimate the quantity of product which will ultimately be returned  there may be a material impact to our financial statements 
contract revenue 
we use the milestone payment method of revenue recognition when all milestones in respect of payments to be received under contractual arrangements are determined to be substantive  at risk and the culmination of an earnings process 
substantive milestones are payments that are conditioned upon events requiring substantive effort  when the amounts of the milestones are reasonable relative to the time  effort and risk involved in achieving them and when the milestones are reasonable relative to each other and the amount of any up front payment 
if these criteria are not met  the timing of the recognition of revenue from the milestone payment may vary 
up front payments are recorded as deferred revenue 
we estimate the length of the remaining development period and amortize an up front payment over that development period 
reimbursement of development costs 
we record revenue for reimbursement of development costs as the actual costs to perform the work are incurred 
we are required to use judgment in recognizing reimbursement revenue in cases where the agreement provides for funding to us that is not dependent on actual costs we incur within a specific fiscal period 
for our collaboration with par pharmaceutical for amoxicillin pulsys  for example  we are entitled to quarterly payments in pre established amounts that fund our development work 
our policy is to limit revenue recognized to the minimum amounts expected under a specific collaboration agreement and to exclude amounts contingent on future events  such as successful commercialization and future profit sharing  and amounts that are contingently refundable 
revenue recognized is limited to cumulative amounts under each contract such that  at any time  if a termination of the agreement were to occur  revenue previously recognized would not need to be reversed 
cash received in excess of revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue  with the deferred revenue recognized as revenue at the time future events occur that remove the contingencies 
intangible assets acquired intangible assets 
we acquired the us rights to the keflex brand of cephalexin in we may acquire additional pharmaceutical products in the future that include license agreements  product rights and other identifiable intangible assets 
when intangible assets are acquired  we review and identify the individual intangible assets acquired and record them based on relative fair values 
each identifiable intangible asset is then reviewed to determine if it has a definite life or indefinite life  and definite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
impairment 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles on an quarterly basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance compared to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of these factors  we first perform an assessment of the asset s recoverability based on expected undiscounted future net cash flow  and if the amount is less than the asset s value  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses for services performed and liabilities incurred 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of estimated accrued expenses for services include professional service fees  such as lawyers and accountants  contract service fees  such as amounts paid to clinical monitors  data management organizations and investigators in conjunction with clinical trials  and fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical materials 
in connection with such service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual levels of services incurred by such service providers 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have begun to be incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often judgmental 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we also make estimates for other liabilities incurred  including health insurance costs for our employees 
we are self insured for claims made under our health insurance program and record an estimate at the end of a period for claims not yet reported 
our risk exposure is limited  as claims over a maximum amount are covered by an aggregate stop loss insurance policy 
stock based compensation we have elected to follow apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  in accounting for our stock based compensation plans  rather than the alternative fair value accounting method provided for under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
in the notes to our financial statements we provide pro forma disclosures in accordance with sfas no 
and related pronouncements 
we account for transactions in which services are received in exchange for equity instruments based on the fair value of such services received from non employees or of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measured  in accordance with sfas no 
and eitf issue no 
the factors which are most likely to affect charges or credits to operations related to stock based compensation are the fair value of the common stock underlying stock options for which stock based compensation is recorded and the volatility of such fair value 
since the company s initial public offering in october  we have used the quoted market price of our common stock as the fair value  and we have established an estimate for volatility by considering the volatility of the stock of other comparable public companies 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we account for income taxes by the liability method 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized for tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end  based on enacted laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are provided if  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we have not recorded any tax provision or benefit for the years ended december   and we have provided a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets since realization of any future benefit from deductible temporary differences and net operating loss carry forwards cannot be sufficiently assured at december  and at december  and  we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  available to reduce future taxable income  which will begin to expire in under the provisions of the internal revenue code  certain substantial changes in our ownership may result in a limitation on the amount of net operating loss carry forwards which can be used in future years 
we believe that ownership changes to date will not limit future utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
at december   the company had research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards of approximately million  of which million are federal tax credit carryforwards which begin to expire in and million are state tax credit carryforwards which begin to expire in safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of certain statements contained in business and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the forward looking statements are based on our current intent  belief and expectations 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
actual results may differ materially from these forward looking statements because of our unproven business model  our dependence on new technologies  the uncertainty and timing of clinical trials  our ability to develop and commercialize products  our dependence on collaborators for services and revenue  our substantial indebtedness and lease obligations  our changing requirements and costs associated with planned facilities  intense competition  the uncertainty of patent and intellectual property protection  our dependence on key management and key suppliers  the uncertainty of regulation of products  the impact of future alliances or transactions and other risks described in this filing and our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
existing and prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of today s date 
we undertake no obligation to update or revise the information contained in this announcement whether as a result of new information  future events or circumstances or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is currently confined to our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  and restricted cash that generally have maturities of less than one year 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
we have not used derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes 
because of the short term maturities of our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  we do not believe that an increase in market rates would have any significant impact on the realized value of our investments  but may increase the interest expense associated with our debt 
our most liquid assets are cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
because of their liquidity  these assets are not directly affected by inflation 
we also believe that we have intangible assets in the value of our intellectual property 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we have not capitalized the value of this intellectual property on our balance sheet 
due to the nature of this intellectual property  we believe that these intangible assets are not affected by inflation 
because we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as those for employee compensation and contract services  which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our resources
