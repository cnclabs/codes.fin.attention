item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the twelve months ended december   and for the period from may  to december  the following also includes a discussion of our financial condition at december  this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report 
this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are not historical facts  including statements about the company s beliefs and expectations 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and particularly under the headings risk factors and business in item of this report and forward looking statements contained in part i of this report 
overview the following overview of our  and operating results and financial condition is intended to identify important themes and should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion further below 
we are a bermuda holding company 
we provide property and casualty reinsurance in the global market through aspen re and aspen bermuda 
we provide property and liability insurance principally in the united kingdom and in the united states through aspen re and aspen specialty and we provide marine and aviation insurance worldwide through aspen re 
aspen re america is a reinsurance intermediary which provides property and casualty reinsurance in the united states exclusively on behalf of aspen re 
during we continued to expand and diversify our portfolio of business lines 
in the united states we established an office in connecticut to write property reinsurance through aspen re america 
we also continued the development of our surplus lines operation through aspen specialty  by expanding our underwriting capacity in boston and by opening offices in georgia and arizona 
in london we hired a team of marine and energy underwriters who began to write business for us in and from whom we expect expanded business production in we also completed negotiations for the recruitment of an established team of aviation underwriters who have subsequently joined us and started underwriting in the capacity of aspen bermuda was expanded by the injection of million of additional capital and the transfer of the majority of our london based property reinsurance underwriting team to bermuda 
the consequent increase in our underwriting activities in bermuda will mainly relate to cedents in the us  japan and the us net income for the twelve months ended december  was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share  for the twelve months ended december  and million  or per share  for the period ended december  management considers this per share increase in net income to reflect a strong overall performance in given the relatively short period since the company started its operations in june and the relative immaturity of its earnings profile 
we measure the maturity of the company s earnings profile by the ratio of net premiums earned to net premiums written  which has increased from for the period ended december   compared to for the twelve months ended december   and for the twelve months ended december  in a steady state in which written premiums were neither increasing nor decreasing from one year to the next  earned premium would equal written premium 
gross premiums written increased from million for the period ended december  to  million for the twelve months ended december  to  million for the twelve months ended december  provisions for losses and related reinstatement premiums arising from catastrophe windstorm losses in the third quarter of amounted to million  equivalent to an impact of on our loss ratio 
our net premiums written of  million for the year ended december  represented of gross premiums written of  million  which indicates that we ceded reinsurance premiums of million 
of the ceded reinsurance premiums  million represented proportional cessions of which our shareholder montpelier re was the main recipient under arrangements established at our formation 
the remaining amount of the ceded reinsurance premiums mostly comprises premiums for retrocessional protection of our property reinsurance account from which we expect to make recoveries in respect of windstorm losses in the third quarter of we monitor the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to net earned premium the loss ratio as a measure of relative underwriting performance where a lower ratio represents a better result than a higher ratio 
our overall loss ratio was for compared to for and for there was a release of net reserves in from prior years of million  equivalent to around percentage points on net earned premium for the year 
for there was a release of net reserves of million equivalent to around percentage points on net earned premium for the year 
further information relating to the release of reserves can be found below under critical accounting policies below 
we monitor the ratio of expenses to net earned premium the expense ratio as a measure of the cost effectiveness of our business acquisition  operating and administrative processes 
the expense ratio was for and for we comment further on loss ratios and expense ratios in our discussion of the segmental results later in this section 
we generated net investment income in of million in a year in which our total investment  cash and cash equivalents increased from billion at the end of to billion at the end of  requiring us to invest significant amounts during a volatile bond market 
investment income in was million and in was million 
we did not pay any dividends to shareholders in in  we paid a quarterly dividend of per ordinary share 
on march   our board of directors authorized an increase in dividends to from per ordinary share 
the dividend will be paid on march  for shareholders of record on march  management considers that the company has advanced its business position as a result of its enhanced capital and surplus which are important in securing the confidence of policyholders and in providing capital to support continued development of the insurance and reinsurance business conducted by our insurance subsidiaries 
total shareholders equity increased from  million at the beginning of to  million at the end of the most significant movements were

a net decrease in currency gains  investment losses and losses on derivatives accounted for as other comprehensive income of million 
the increase in shareholders equity resulted in an increase in diluted book value per share treasury stock method of to at december  from at the beginning of our total capital was increased on august  by the issuance and sale of million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the senior notes 
the amounts outstanding under our senior notes as further described under liquidity and capital resources were the only material debt that we had outstanding as of december  management monitors the ratio of debt to total capital  with total capital being defined as shareholders equity plus outstanding debt 
at december   this ratio was  compared to as of december  nil 
management considers this to be well under the level at which it would expect rating agencies or customers to be concerned about excessive financial leverage 
management monitors the liquidity of aspen holdings and of each of its insurance subsidiaries 
with respect to aspen holdings  management monitors its ability to service debt  to finance dividend payments to shareholders and to provide financial support to the insurance subsidiaries 
during  aspen holdings received million in dividends from aspen re 
as at december   aspen holdings held million in cash and cash equivalents which  taken together with our credit facilities  management considered sufficient to provide us liquidity at such time 
at december   the insurance subsidiaries held million in cash and short term investments that are readily realizable securities 
management monitors the value  currency and duration of the cash and investments within its insurance subsidiaries to ensure that they are able to meet their insurance and other liabilities as they become due and was satisfied that there was a comfortable margin of liquidity as at december  and for the foreseeable future 
market conditions  rate trends and developments in on a premium weighted average basis  our whole portfolio experience was flat in terms of rate adequacy during january  renewals 
within this overall figure there are many variations  some of them being significant 
our insurance lines saw more competition than our reinsurance segment and it is important to note that the reinsurance component is considerably larger 
in the uk  both commercial property and employer s liability insurance saw some resurgence of price competition during january  renewals 
these lines saw downward rate movements of approximately and  respectively 
while this is unwelcome  we believe that both lines have been performing well and we have strategies in place to retreat to our core top performing risks if need be 
rates in the marine and energy lines were stable to rising with the best increases in offshore energy related business  especially if the risk has sustained a loss from hurricane ivan 
with the recent recruitment of our underwriting team for marine insurance  we believe this offers us an excellent business opportunity during the course of rate reductions in european property  which represents about of our total property reinsurance account  averaged about  while us business in general saw reductions of approximately 
we managed to increase our share in some well priced contracts and cancelled some less well rated contracts with the net effect of increasing our rate adequacy by approximately across the property reinsurance lines as a whole 
this is a positive achievement  although as the year progresses  we are unlikely to continue to buck the market trend 
in the casualty reinsurance segment we saw rate increases  typically by single digit percentage points in our medical malpractice business 
workers compensation clash is showing sizable reductions while the rest of the us business  in common with the international market  has been flat 
we test our allocation of capital to different lines of business seeking to reduce or even exit those that are becoming less attractive and endeavoring to be one of the first carriers to target new and improving opportunities 
this has led us to avoid or maintain minimal exposure to the two areas of property and casualty reinsurance and insurance we currently regard as the most challenging  mainly fortune or multinational property and directors and officers insurance  where rate reductions in the range of to are not uncommon 
in summary  we have seen the trend in pricing slope gently downwards in the case of reinsurance business and somewhat more markedly downwards for insurance lines  however  we anticipate that our lines of business will continue to offer positive returns in terms and conditions continued to hold throughout our portfolio during the january  renewal season 
in march  our new aviation team will be complete 
based upon the team s collective track record of producing gross and net underwriting profits for previous employers  we believe that our aviation team is one of the top in the sector 
the team has a great deal of experience and a differentiated product mix which generally avoids us trunk carriers and major product manufacturers 
revenues from insurance and reinsurance contracts we derive our revenues primarily from our insurance and reinsurance contracts 
these revenues are included in our statement of operations after taking into account amounts payable to our reinsurers 
the amount of net premiums included as revenue in any reporting period depends on 
spacer

spacer 
gif 
the amount and type of contracts written and the premiums we are able to charge to policyholders which are influenced by multiple factors  including prevailing market prices  
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
the amount and type of reinsurance ceded and the reinsurance premiums payable  
spacer

spacer 
gif 
the distribution of the renewal dates of the business we write which are fairly evenly distributed through the year for our insurance business but are concentrated at the beginning of quarters particularly january st for our reinsurance business  and 
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
the length of time over which the premiums receivable are earned and reinsurance premiums are expensed 
other revenues revenues also include investment income and realized investment gains offset by realized investment losses 
investment income is derived from holdings of cash and money market deposits and from fixed income investments 
realized investment gains and losses are derived from the sale of fixed income investments all of which are held as marketable securities available for sale 
these securities are carried at fair market value and any resulting unrealized gains and losses are not included as revenue in our statement of operations but are included in comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders equity 
the statement of operations for the period from may  to december  includes a significant amount in respect of realized currency exchange gains but such gains are not expected to be a material recurrent component of our revenues 
expenses our expenses are classified under four headings as set out below 
losses and loss adjustment expenses 
these expenses include claims paid and payable under our insurance and reinsurance contracts and the internal and external costs of settling these claims loss adjustment expenses 
the amount of these expenses is a function of the amount and type of insurance and reinsurance contracts we write and  with respect to reinsurance contracts  of the loss experience of the clients we reinsure 
the amount of the expense is reduced to the extent that we can make recoveries from our reinsurers 
the amount reported under this heading in any period includes payments in the period plus the change in the value of the reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses between the beginning and the end of the period 
our method for setting the reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at the end of any period is discussed below under critical accounting policies 
policy acquisition expenses 
policy acquisition expenses consist principally of commissions and similar charges payable to brokers  other intermediaries and ceding companies  many of which represent a percentage of premiums receivable by us together with staff costs directly attributable to underwriting 
the amount of expenses varies according to the amount and types of contracts written 
operating and administrative expenses 
these expenses consist primarily of staff compensation  payroll taxes  accommodation costs  information technology and other operating expenses and professional fees 
this heading also includes depreciation of tangible assets 
staff compensation includes salaries  bonuses  share related compensation and benefits such as medical insurance and pension contributions 
income tax expense 
this expense primarily represents corporation tax paid or payable by our uk operating company 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements contain certain amounts that are inherently subjective in nature and have required management to make assumptions and best estimates to determine the reported values 
if actual events differ significantly from management s underlying assumptions or estimates  there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and liquidity 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the descriptions below are summarized and have been simplified for clarity 
a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies we use to prepare our financial statements is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
if factors such as those described in risk factors cause actual events to differ from the assumptions used in applying the accounting policy and calculating financial results  there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and liquidity 
premiums 
written premiums comprise the estimated premiums on contracts of insurance and reinsurance entered into in the reporting period except in the case of proportional reinsurance contracts where written premium relates only to our proportional share of premiums due on contracts entered into by the ceding company prior to the end of the reporting period 
premiums written and ceded include estimates based on information received from brokers  ceding companies and insureds 
as actual premiums are reported by the ceding companies  management evaluates the appropriateness of the premium estimate and any adjustment to this estimate is recorded in the period in which it becomes known 
premiums on our excess of loss and proportional reinsurance contracts are estimated by management when the business is underwritten 
for excess of loss contracts  the minimum and deposit premium  as defined in the contract  is generally considered to be the best estimate of the contract s written premium at inception 
accordingly  this is the amount we generally record as written premium in the period the underlying risks incept 
estimates of premiums assumed under proportional contracts are recorded in the period in which the underlying risks are expected to incept and are based on information provided by brokers and ceding companies and estimates of the underlying economic conditions at the time the risk is underwritten 
adjustments to original premium estimates could be material and these adjustments may directly and significantly impact earnings in the period they are determined because the subject premium may be fully or substantially earned 
premiums are recognized as earned evenly over the policy periods using the daily pro rata method 
the premium related to the unexpired portion of each policy at the end of the reporting period is included in the balance sheet as unearned premiums 
premiums receivable are recorded as amounts due less any required provision for doubtful accounts 
reserve for losses and loss expenses 
provision is made at the year end for the estimated cost of claims incurred but not settled at the balance sheet date  including the cost of ibnr claims 
the estimated cost of claims includes expenses to be incurred in settling claims and a deduction for the expected value of salvage and other recoveries 
as required under us gaap  no provision is made for our exposure to natural or man made catastrophes other than for events occurring before the balance sheet date 
we take all reasonable steps to ensure that we have appropriate information regarding our claims exposures 
however  given the uncertainty in establishing claims liabilities  it is likely that the final outcome will prove to be different from the original provision established 
the following presents our loss reserves by business segment as at december  and

in establishing the reserves set by the company  the company s actuary employs a number of techniques to establish a range of estimates 
the insurance reserves are established for the total unpaid cost of claims and loss adjustment expenses  which cover events that have occurred before the balance sheet date 
these reserves reflect the company s estimates of the total cost of ibnr claims to it 
estimated amounts recoverable from reinsurers on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are calculated to arrive at a net claims reserve 
for reported claims  reserves are established on a case by case basis within the parameters of coverage provided in the insurance policy or reinsurance agreement 
in estimating the cost of these claims  we consider circumstances related to the claims as reported  any information available from loss adjustors and information on the cost of settling claims with similar characteristics in previous periods 
for ibnr claims  reserves are estimated using established actuarial methods 
both case and ibnr reserve estimates consider such variables as past loss experience  changes in legislative conditions and changes in judicial interpretation of legal liability policy coverages and inflation 
for classes of business which are not related to catastrophe  and where early claims experience may not provide a sound statistical basis to estimate the loss reserves  our approach is to establish an initial expected loss and loss expense ratio 
this is based upon a combination of a an analysis of our own claims experience to date on our portfolio  b market benchmark data  c a contract by contract analysis  and d an analysis of a portfolio of similar business written by syndicate  as available  adjusted by an index reflecting how insurance rates  terms and conditions have changed 
this initial expected loss and loss expense ratio is then modified in light of the actual experience to date measured against the expected experience 
loss reserves for known catastrophic events are based upon a detailed analysis of our reported losses and potential exposures conducted in conjunction with our underwriters 
because many of the coverages underwritten involve claims that may not be ultimately settled for many years after they are incurred  subjective judgments as to the ultimate exposure to losses are an integral and necessary component of the loss reserving process 
reserves are established by the selection of a best estimate from within a range of estimates 
the company continually reviews its reserves  using a variety of statistical and actuarial techniques to analyze current claims costs  frequency and severity data  and prevailing economic  social and legal factors 
reserves established in prior periods are adjusted as claims experience develops and new information becomes available 
the range of estimates established by the actuary is not intended to include the minimum or maximum amount that the claims may ultimately be  but is designed to provide management with a range from which it is reasonable to select a single best estimate for inclusion in the financial statements taking into account the impact that all the factors affecting the reserves may have 
the net actuarial range for reserves for losses and loss expenses established as at december  was between million and  million 
the actual net reserves established as at december  were  million 
the net actuarial range for reserves for losses and loss expenses established as at december  was between million and million 
the actual net reserves established as at that date were million 
in selecting our best estimates of the reserves for each line of business we take into account all of the factors set out above  and in particular the quality of the historical information the company has on which to establish its reserves and the degree of estimation where information is received from cedents on an underwriting year basis and needs to be converted to an accident year basis 
in addition  consideration is given to the point estimate produced by our independent consulting actuaries which was towards the upper end of the range for the year ended december  loss reserves presented on an underwriting year basis represent claims related to all policies incepting in a given year 
in contrast  accident year loss reserves represent claims for events that occurred during a given calendar year  regardless of when the policy was written 
loss reserves on an underwriting year basis may include claims from different accident years 
for example  a policy written during may have losses in accident year and in accident year therefore  underwriting year data as of a particular evaluation date is less mature than accident year data 
while the reported reserves make a reasonable provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense obligations  it should be noted that the process of estimating required reserves does  by its very nature  involve uncertainty 
the level of uncertainty can be influenced by such factors as the existence of coverage with long duration payment patterns and changes in claims handling practices  as well as the factors noted above 
ultimate actual payments for losses and loss adjustment expenses could turn out to be significantly different from our estimates 
prior year loss reserves 
in the twelve months ended december  and  there was a reduction of our estimate of the ultimate claims to be paid 
an analysis of this reduction by line of business is as follows

for the twelve months ended december  the analysis of the favorable development by each line of business is as follows property reinsurance the net reserves of the property reinsurance line of business as at december  were million  which included specific case reserves in relation to brush fires in the united states  hurricanes  fabian and isabel and a phillips factory loss in normandy  france 
further claims information received during the twelve months to december  highlighted a lower severity of these reported claims than was originally anticipated and has given rise to a million reduction in reserves in the period 
casualty reinsurance the net reserves of the casualty reinsurance line of business as at december  were million 
we do not receive notice of most of the claims in this line of business until a considerable time has passed  however incurred claims development in the twelve months ended december  has resulted in a small increase in the projected loss ratio for this class of business giving rise to a strengthening of reserves of million 
specialty reinsurance the net reserves of the specialty reinsurance line of business as at december  were million  largely derived through the wellington quota share arrangements 
premium and claims information received from the cedent during the twelve months ended december  has enabled the company to refine its accident year assessment 
further information received concerning the development of reserves acquired by the acquisition of city fire has also contributed to the overall release in reserves of million 
commercial property the net reserves of the commercial property line of business as at december  were million 
better than expected development in incurred claims during and the short tail nature of this class of business has enabled the company to refine its accident year assessment 
this has given rise to a release in net reserves of million 
commercial liability the net reserves of the commercial liability line of business as at december  were million 
during  development of incurred claims has been slower than previously expected resulting in a reduction in the projected loss ratio suggested by the actuarial projection at december  this has resulted in a release in net reserves of million in the period 
for the twelve months ended december  the analysis of the favorable development on a line of business basis is as follows property reinsurance the net reserves of the property reinsurance line of business as at december  were million  of which million related to the wellington quota share arrangements 
premiums and claims information received from the syndicates and other cedents during the twelve months ended december  has indicated both a reduction in the underwriting year loss ratio and also an improvement in the accident year loss ratio for this results from a lower development of the severity of reported claims than is often observed in this line of business and gave rise to a million reduction in reserves 
casualty reinsurance the net reserves of the casualty reinsurance line of business as at december  were million 
although we do not receive notice of most of the claims in this line of business until a considerable time has passed  some claims have a shorter notification period due to some of the more catastrophic elements of the business 
the development of incurred losses in the twelve months subsequent to december  has enabled a small reduction in the projected loss ratio for this business from that suggested by the actuarial projection at december   giving rise to the reduction in reserves of million 
specialty reinsurance the net reserves of the specialty reinsurance line of business as at december  were million 
all of the specialty business as at december  was derived through the wellington quota share arrangements 
the reserves established as at december  were based upon the cedents underwriting year estimates 
management assessed these estimates and  with the data provided  determined the accident year loss ratio 
premiums and claims information received from the cedent during the twelve months ended december  has enabled the company to refine its accident year assessment 
this has resulted in a release in reserves of million 
commercial property the net reserves of the property insurance line of business as at december  were million 
this account had only two years of syndicates history prior to its being written by the company 
the reserves established as at december  were partly based upon the historical performance experienced in those two years 
during the course of  the historical information improved due in particular to the settlement of one claim significantly below its case reserve 
this improvement enabled us to reassess the likely level of ibnr claims in respect of the accident year  resulting in a reduction in reserves of million 
other than the matters described above  the company did not make any significant changes in assumptions used in our reserving process 
however  because the period of time we have been in operation is short  our loss experience is limited and reliable evidence of changes in trends of numbers of claims incurred  average settlement amounts  numbers of claims outstanding and average losses per claim will necessarily take years to develop 
estimates of ibnr are generally subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than estimates of the cost of settling claims already notified to the company  where more information about the claim event is generally available 
ibnr claims often may not be apparent to the insured until many years after the event giving rise to the claims has happened 
lines of business where the ibnr proportion of the total reserve is high  such as liability insurance  will typically display greater variations between initial estimates and final outcomes because of the greater degree of difficulty of estimating these reserves 
lines of business where claims are typically reported relatively quickly after the claim event tend to display lower levels of volatility between initial estimates and final outcomes 
allowance is made  however  for changes or uncertainties which may create distortions in the underlying statistics or which might cause the cost of unsettled claims to increase or reduce when compared with the cost of previously settled claims including

the impact of large losses 
as at december   a change in the reserve for net ibnr losses would equate to a change of approximately million in loss reserves which would represent of income from operations before income tax for the twelve months ended december  as at december   a change in the reserve net for ibnr losses would equate to a change of approximately million in loss reserves which would represent of income from operations before income tax for the twelve months ended december  reinsurance recoveries in respect of estimated ibnr claims are assumed to be consistent with the historical pattern of such recoveries  adjusted to reflect changes in the nature and extent of our reinsurance program over time 
an assessment is also made of the collectability of reinsurance recoveries taking into account market data on the financial strength of each of the reinsurance companies 
reinstatement premiums 
reinstatement premiums and additional premiums are accrued as provided for in the provisions of assumed reinsurance contracts  based on experience under such contracts 
reinstatement premiums are the premiums charged for the restoration of the reinsurance limit of an excess of loss contract to its full amount after payment by the reinsurer of losses as a result of an occurrence 
these premiums relate to the future coverage obtained during the remainder of the initial policy term and are earned over the remaining policy term 
additional premiums are premiums charged after coverage has expired  related to experience during the policy term  which are earned immediately 
an allowance for uncollectible premiums is established for possible non payment of such amounts due  as deemed necessary 
results of operations aspen holdings was formed on may  and acquired city fire on june  city fire was subsequently renamed as wellington re and then as aspen re 
aspen re commenced underwriting on june  aspen bermuda was formed on november  and commenced insurance operations on december  aspen specialty was acquired on september  our fiscal year ends on december our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the following is a discussion and analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the twelve months ended december  and  the twelve months ended december  and and the period from our incorporation on may  to december  in  we derived a significant proportion of our premiums from two quota share contracts under which we reinsured part of the portfolio of risks written by the syndicates and managed by wual the wellington quota share arrangements 
with effect from january  we renewed reinsurance business and uk insurance business previously written by the syndicates within our own uk subsidiary 
we did however continue to assume risks in respect of other lines of business written by syndicate from january  under a quota share contract under which we accepted of most of the classes written by the syndicate from that date 
the quota share arrangement with syndicate is a much less significant part of our business than were the wellington quota share arrangements 
in  we did not enter into a quota share arrangement with syndicate for the twelve months ended december  and twelve months ended december  gross premiums written 
in the twelve months ended december  gross premiums written were  million compared to  million for the twelve months ended december   an increase of 
the increases included million from net new business and rate increases in casualty reinsurance  million from new property reinsurance business written through aspen re america  million from our new marine lines of business and million of new business written by aspen specialty and reported under property insurance million and liability insurance million

liquidity and capital resources at december   aspen holdings had cash and cash equivalents of million that are available to pay its operating expenses and liabilities 
we did not pay any dividends to shareholders in but in our board of directors authorized a quarterly dividend payment of per ordinary share per fiscal quarter 
on march   our board of directors authorized an increase in dividends to from per ordinary share 
the dividend will be paid on march  for shareholders of record on march  as of january   the maximum amount of distributions that our insurance subsidiaries could have paid to us under applicable laws and regulations without prior regulatory approval was approximately million 
this amount increased to approximately million as of december  the ability of aspen bermuda to pay dividends is dependent on its ability to meet the requirements of applicable bermuda law and regulations 
under bermuda law  aspen bermuda may not declare or pay a dividend if there are reasonable grounds for believing that aspen bermuda is  or would after the payment be  unable to pay its liabilities as they become due  or the realizable value of aspen bermuda s assets would thereby be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium accounts 
further  aspen bermuda  as a regulated insurance company in bermuda  is subject to additional regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends or distributions 
as of december   aspen bermuda could pay a dividend or make a distribution out of contributed surplus totaling approximately million without prior regulatory approval based upon the bermuda insurance act and the bermuda companies act regulations

as of december   aspen re could pay a dividend totaling approximately million without prior regulatory approval based upon the fsa and the companies act regulations

for a discussion of the various restrictions on our ability and our insurance subsidiaries ability to pay dividends  see business regulatory matters in part i  item in this report 
in  aspen re paid a total of million in dividends to the company 
on august   aspen re paid the company a dividend of million 
on december  an additional dividend of million was paid 
management monitors the liquidity of aspen holdings and of each of its insurance subsidiaries 
in relation to aspen holdings  we monitor its ability to service debt  to finance dividend payments to shareholders and to provide financial support to the insurance subsidiaries 
during  the cash position of aspen holdings was significantly enhanced by the payment of million in dividends by aspen re to aspen holdings and by the retention within aspen holdings of part of the proceeds from our initial public offering 
as at december  and  aspen holdings held and million  respectively  in cash and fixed interest securities and nil and million  respectively  in short term investments which management considers sufficient to provide us liquidity at this time 
as of december   the insurance subsidiaries held approximately million in cash and short term investments that are readily realizable securities 
operating cash flow  borrowing and the issuance of additional ordinary shares for cash increased the total cash and cash equivalents held by the company by million during the twelve months ended december  management monitors the value  currency and duration of the cash and investments held by its insurance subsidiaries to ensure that they are able to meet their insurance and other liabilities as they become due and was satisfied that there was a comfortable margin of liquidity as at december  and for the foreseeable future 
our aggregate invested assets as of december  totaled billion compared to aggregate invested assets of billion as of december  the increase in invested assets since december  resulted from the issuance of our senior notes  collections of premiums on insurance policies and reinsurance contracts and investment income  offset by policy acquisition expenses paid  reinsurance premiums paid  payment of losses and loss adjustment expenses  operating and administrative expenses paid and repayment of short term borrowings 
cash flows for the twelve months ended december  total net cash flow from operating activities in the twelve months ended december  was approximately million  an increase of million from the twelve months ended december  for the twelve months ended december   our cash flows from operations provided us with sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements 
we paid net claims of million in the twelve months ended december  we made net investments in the amount of  million in market securities during the period 
we paid dividends of million  and raised million from our senior notes offering 
at december   we had a cash balance of million 
cash flows for the twelve months ended december  in the twelve months ended december  we generated net cash from operating activities of million  primarily relating to premiums and investment income received offset by reinsurance premiums payable 
we paid claims of million in the period 
we made net investments in the amount of million in market securities during the period 
cash and cash equivalents increased from million at the beginning of the period to million at the end of the period 
cash flows for the period from incorporation on may  to december  in the period from may  to december   we received million in cash from a private placement of our ordinary shares  net of equity raising costs of million 
during this period  we generated an operating net cash inflow of million  primarily relating to net premiums received by aspen re 
we did not make any significant capital expenditures during the period from inception to december  we made net investments of million in market securities in the period  and had a cash balance of million at december  aspen holdings was formed on may  but did not commence operations until june  the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the period from may  to december  therefore reflects the results for only twenty eight weeks and comparisons with the year ended december  may not be meaningful 
liquidity 
our liquidity depends on operating  investing and financing cash flows  described as follows 
on an ongoing basis  our insurance subsidiaries sources of funds primarily consist of premiums written  investment income and proceeds from sales and redemptions of investments 
cash is used primarily to pay reinsurance premiums  losses and loss adjustment expenses  brokerage commissions  general and administrative expenses and taxes and to purchase new investments 
we may also use cash to pay for any authorized share repurchases and dividends 
our cash flows from operations represent the difference between premiums collected and the losses and loss adjustment expenses paid  underwriting and other expenses paid 
the potential for a large claim under one of our reinsurance contracts means that substantial and unpredictable payments may need to be made within relatively short periods of time 
we intend to manage these risks by maintaining a substantial proportion of our invested assets in securities having durations less than the durations of our liabilities even though this may over time reduce the yield on our investments below that which might be obtained if our asset durations were perfectly matched to our liability durations 
notwithstanding this policy  if our calculations with respect to these liabilities are incorrect  we could be forced to liquidate investments prior to maturity  potentially at a significant loss

accordingly  aspen re and aspen bermuda are currently relevant subsidiaries 
on october  we made a drawdown of million on the three year credit facility 
of this borrowing  million was used to provide part of the initial capital to aspen specialty and the balance was used to provide working capital to aspen holdings 
the interest rate is three month libor plus basis points 
a facility fee  currently calculated at a rate of basis points on the average daily amount of the commitment of each lender  is paid to each lender quarterly in arrears 
on december   million of the loan was repaid following receipt of funds from our initial public offering 
we have repaid the remaining million in principal amount due with a portion of the net proceeds from the offering of  in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due on august   we closed our offering of the senior notes under rule a and regulation s under the securities act 
the senior notes are due in and have an interest rate of per annum 
we also have granted and agreed certain customary exchange and shelf registration rights the notes registration rights agreement to noteholders under the terms of the senior notes 
the gross proceeds from the senior notes offering were million 
a portion of the proceeds of the offering was used to repay million in principal amount of outstanding borrowings under our existing credit facilities 
subsequently  in november  we contributed a further million to aspen bermuda  which was partly funded from the proceeds of the senior notes offering 
subject to certain exceptions  so long as any of the senior notes remain outstanding  we have agreed that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries will i create a lien on any shares of capital stock of any designated subsidiary currently aspen re and aspen bermuda  as defined in the indenture  or ii issue  sell  assign  transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares of capital stock of any designated subsidiary

under the notes registration rights agreement  we agreed to file a registration statement for the senior notes and cause its effectiveness within prescribed periods  and consummate the exchange offer within days after the date the registration statement becomes effective 
we filed the registration statement and caused its effectiveness within those prescribed periods 
the exchange offer commenced on march  the senior notes are senior unsecured general obligations of the company and rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness from time to time outstanding 
the senior notes are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries 
the senior notes outstanding were the only material debt that we had outstanding at december  management monitors the ratio of debt to total capital  with total capital being defined as shareholders equity plus outstanding debt 
at december  this ratio was as of december  
management considers this to be well under the level at which it would expect rating agencies or customers to be concerned about excessive financial leverage 
on february   we filed a universal shelf registration statement on form f with the sec for the issuance and sale of up to million of debt and or equity securities from time to time 
the registration statement was declared effective on march  and is expected to allow us access to the public capital markets to the extent the need arises 
also included in the registration statement were  ordinary shares which may be offered for sale by our shareholders 
we will not receive any proceeds from sales by our shareholders but may have to pay related expenses 
in  we expect to have capital expenditures in respect of our information technology systems and our future premises in london and bermuda

the long term debt obligation disclosed above does not include the million annual interest payable on the senior notes 
in estimating the time intervals into which payments of our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses fall  as set out above  we have utilised actuarially assessed payment patterns 
by the nature of the insurance and reinsurance contracts under which these liabilities are assumed  there can be no certainty that actual payments will fall in the periods shown and there could be a material acceleration or deceleration of claims payments depending on factors outside our control 
this uncertainty is heightened by the short time in which we have operated  thereby providing limited company specific claims loss payment patterns 
the total amount of payments in respect of our reserves  as well as the timing of such payments  may differ materially from our current estimates for the reasons set out above under critical accounting policies reserves for losses and loss expenses 
on october   aspen re entered into a new lease for office space in london of approximately a total of  square feet covering three floors 
the term of each lease for each floor commenced in november and runs for years 
service charges of approximately million per annum are payable from this date  and are subject to increase 
it is expected that we will begin to pay the yearly basic rent of approximately million per annum months after the relevant date of practical completion of the landlord s works 
the basic annual rent for each of the leases will each be subject to yearly upwards only rent reviews 
there are no contractual provisions in any of the leases allowing us to terminate any of the leases prior to expiration of the year contractual terms

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that we are principally exposed to three types of market risk interest rate risk  foreign currency risk and credit risk 
interest rate risk 
our investment portfolio consists of fixed income securities 
accordingly  our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these securities 
as interest rates rise  the market value of our fixed income portfolio falls  and the converse is also true 
we expect to manage interest rate risk by selecting investments with characteristics such as duration  yield  currency and liquidity taking into account the anticipated cash outflow characteristics of aspen re s  aspen bermuda s and aspen specialty s insurance and reinsurance liabilities 
our strategy for managing interest rate risk also includes maintaining a high quality portfolio with a relatively short duration to reduce the effect of interest rate changes on book value 
a significant portion of the investment portfolio matures each year  allowing for reinvestment at current market rates 
the portfolio is actively managed and trades are made to balance our exposure to interest rates 
as at december  our portfolio had an approximate duration of years 
the table below depicts interest rate change scenarios and the effect on our interest rate sensitive invested assets

foreign currency risk 
our reporting currency is the us dollar 
the functional currencies of our reinsurance and insurance segments are us dollars and british pounds 
as of december  approximately of our investments are held in us dollars  approximately are in british pounds and approximately are in currencies other than the us dollar and the british pound 
for the twelve months ended december   of our gross premiums were written in currencies other than the us dollar and the british pound and we expect that a similar proportion will be written in currencies other than the us dollar and the british pound in other foreign currency amounts are remeasured to the appropriate functional currency and the resulting foreign exchange gains or losses are reflected in the statement of operations 
functional currency amounts of assets and liabilities are then translated into us dollars 
the unrealized gain or loss from this translation  net of tax  is recorded as part of ordinary shareholders equity 
the change in unrealized foreign currency translation gain or loss during the year  net of tax  is a component of comprehensive income 
both the remeasurement and translation are calculated using current exchange rates for the balance sheets and average exchange rates for the statement of operations 
we may experience exchange losses to the extent our foreign currency exposure is not properly managed or otherwise hedged  which in turn would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
management estimates that a change in the exchange rate between british pounds and us dollars as at december   would have impacted reported net comprehensive income by approximately million for the twelve months ended december  we will attempt to manage our foreign currency risk by seeking to match our liabilities under insurance and reinsurance policies that are payable in foreign currencies with investments that are denominated in these currencies 
during  we entered into a significant forward exchange contract for the sale of british pounds into us dollars in anticipation of the receipt in november of the second tranche of our initial capital 
a forward foreign currency exchange contract involves an obligation to purchase or sell a specified currency at a future date at a price set at the time of the contract 
foreign currency exchange contracts will not eliminate fluctuations in the value of our assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but rather allow us to establish a rate of exchange for a future point in time 
we do not expect going forward that we will enter into these contracts with respect to a material amount of our assets 
all realized gains and losses and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized in the statement of operations 
there were no outstanding forward contracts as at december  credit risk 
we have exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed income securities 
our risk management strategy and investment policy is to invest in debt instruments of high credit quality issuers and to limit the amount of credit exposure with respect to particular ratings categories and any one issuer 
no more than of the fixed income securities in our investment portfolio may be rated below a 
as at december   the average rate of fixed income securities in our investment portfolio was aa 
in addition  we are exposed to the credit risk of our insurance and reinsurance brokers to whom we make claims payments for insureds and our reinsureds  as well as to the credit risk of our reinsurers and retrocessionaires who assume business from us 
other than fully collateralized reinsurance the substantial majority of our reinsurers have a rating of a excellent  the third highest of fifteen rating levels  or better by am best and the minimum rating of any of our material reinsurers is a excellent  the fourth highest of fifteen rating levels  by am best 
effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  except insofar as inflation may affect interest rates 
the potential exists  after a catastrophe loss  for the development of inflationary pressures in a local economy as the demand for services such as construction typically surges 
our calculation of reserves for losses and loss expenses includes assumptions about future payments for settlement of claims and claims handling expenses  such as medical treatments and litigation costs 
we write liability business in the united states  the united kingdom and australia  where claims inflation has grown particularly strong in recent years 
to the extent inflation causes these costs to increase above reserves established for these claims  we will be required to increase our loss reserves with a corresponding reduction in retained earnings 
the actual effects of inflation on our results cannot be accurately known until claims are ultimately settled 
in addition to general price inflation we are exposed to a persisting long term upwards trend in the cost of judicial awards for damages 
we take this into account in our pricing and reserving of casualty business
