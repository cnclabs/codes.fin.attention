we expect this seasonality will continue in the future 
in anticipation of increased sales activity during the third and fourth quarters  tsg incurs significant additional expenses for hiring employees and building inventory levels 
tgw s business is seasonal 
sales leading up to and during father s day and the christmas holiday selling seasons have historically contributed to a higher percentage of tgw s annual sales and net income than other periods 
tgw also incurs higher expenses related to building inventory to meet higher demand during these seasons

liquidity and capital resources working capital 
we had working capital of million as of december  compared to million as of december   with current ratios of to and to  respectively 
the decrease of million was primarily due to the utilization of excess cash in the acquisition of the golf warehouse effective june  we purchase large quantities of manufacturers close outs and direct imports  particularly in footwear and apparel merchandise categories 
the seasonal nature of the merchandise may require that it be held for several months before being offered in a catalog 
this can result in increased inventory levels and lower inventory turnover  thereby increasing our working capital requirements and related carrying costs 
tsg offers its buyer s club members an installment credit plan with no finance fees  known as the buyer s club pay plan 
each of the four consecutive monthly installments is billed directly to customers credit cards 
tsg had installment receivables of million at december  compared to million at december  the installment plan will continue to require the allocation of working capital  which we expect to fund from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility 
on june   we entered into an amended credit agreement with wells fargo bank  national association providing a revolving line of credit up to million and a term loan of million  expiring on september  the revolving line of credit is for working capital and letters of credit and the proceeds from the term loan are for financing acquisitions of other business operations 
letters of credit may not exceed million at any one time 
funding under the credit facility  if combined borrowings under the line of credit and term loan exceed million  is limited to a collateral base of of eligible inventory plus of eligible trade accounts receivable 
borrowings from the revolving line of credit and term loan bear interest at the bank s prime rate less or  at the company s option  fixed term libor plus percentage points  provided certain financial ratios are met 
the revolving credit line and term loan are collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
all borrowings are subject to various covenants while the term loan remains outstanding  which include funded debt to earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
the agreement also prohibits the payment of dividends to shareholders without the consent of the bank

at december   future contractual obligations under the above agreements are as follows in thousands payment due by period more than contractual obligations total years years years long term debt   obligations operating lease    obligations purchase obligations   total    operating activities 
cash flows provided by operating activities during were million compared to million in the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily the result of an increase in inventory position at year end and lower accounts payable to vendors 
the higher inventory position at the end of was due to higher level of inventory at tsg and the inclusion of tgw s inventory position for the first time as a result of the acquisition effective june  tsg s inventory position was higher at the end of largely due to the fact that a greater percentage of the inventory to support the spring business was received by year end in than at the end of the lower accounts payable to vendors at the end of was due to the timing of inventory receipts and the subsequent payments to the vendors 
payment terms from our vendors for have not changed significantly from those of cash flows provided by operating activities during were million compared to million in the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily the result of an increase in net earnings  a lower inventory position at year end and higher payables to vendors as a result of current vendor terms

the increase in cash flows provided from the borrowings under the credit facility and the cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options was virtually offset by payments to repurchase the company s common stock 
on may   the company announced that its board of directors authorized a plan to repurchase up to ten percent of its outstanding common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions over the next months
