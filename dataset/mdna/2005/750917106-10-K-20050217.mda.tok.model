item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements  including  without limitation  our expectations regarding revenues  expenses and results of operations 
our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  those discussed in the risk factors section  and below 
we assume no obligation to update the forward looking statements or such risk factors 
overview rambus inc creates a broad range of chip interface technologies that improve the time to market  performance and cost effectiveness of our customers semiconductor and system products 
our products can be grouped into three major categories patent licenses  memory interfaces and logic interfaces 
our patent licenses provide rights to elements or all of our broad patent portfolio 
our memory interface technologies provide an interface between memory chips and logic chips 
our logic interface technologies provide an interface between two logic chips 
our licensed products are used in a broad range of computing  consumer electronics and communications applications 
our chip interface technologies are covered by more than us and international patents 
in addition  we have over patent applications currently pending 
these patent and patent applications cover important inventions in memory and logic chip interfaces  in addition to other technologies 
we believe that our interface technologies provide a lower risk  more cost effective alternative for our customers than can be achieved through their own internal research and development efforts 
we offer our semiconductor and system customers a number of alternatives for using our chip interface technologies in their products 
first  we license elements  or all  of our patent portfolio  for which they pay us royalties 
second  we develop chip interface designs and license elements of our patent portfolio  for which they pay us royalties and license fees 
third  we offer engineering implementation and support services  for which they pay us engineering services fees 
royalties represent a substantial portion of our total revenue 
the remaining part of our revenue is contract revenue which includes license fees and engineering services fees 
amounts invoiced to our customers in excess of recognized revenue are recorded as deferred revenues 
the timing and amounts invoiced to customers can vary significantly depending on specific contract terms  and can have a significant impact on deferred revenues in any given period 
we have a high degree of customer concentration  with our top five customers representing  and of our revenues for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
for the twelve months ended december   revenue from intel  toshiba and elpida  each accounted for greater than of our total revenues 
for the twelve months ended december  and  revenues from intel  toshiba and samsung  each accounted for greater than of total revenues 
our revenue from companies based outside of the united states accounted for  and of our revenues for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
we expect that we may continue to experience significant revenue concentration for the foreseeable future and have significant revenues from companies based outside the united states for the foreseeable future 
for the last four years  we have been involved in significant litigation stemming from the unlicensed use of our inventions 
our litigation expenses have been high and difficult to predict during this time and we anticipate future litigation expenses to continue to be significant  volatile and difficult to predict 
if we are successful in the litigation and or related licensing  our revenue could be substantially higher in the future  if we are unsuccessful  our revenue would likely decline 

table of contents subsequent event on february   we issued million aggregate principal amount of zero coupon senior convertible notes due february  to credit suisse first boston llc credit suisse and deutsche bank securities deutsche bank 
we have granted credit suisse and deutsche bank a day option to acquire an additional million aggregate principal amount of notes 
we elected to pay the principal amount of the notes in cash when they are due and the initial conversion price of the notes is per share 
see note to our notes to consolidated financial statements for the terms of these notes 
in connection with this issuance  on january   we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at a price of per share for a total cost of million 
revenue concentration as previously discussed  we have a high degree of customer concentration  with our top five customers representing  and of our revenues for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
for the twelve months ended december   revenue from intel  toshiba and elpida  each accounted for greater than of our total revenues 
for the twelve months ended december  and  revenues from intel  toshiba and samsung  each accounted for greater than of total revenues 
many of our licensees  including intel  have the right to cancel their licenses  and the loss of any of our top five licensees would have a material adverse effect on our business 
the particular licensees which account for revenue concentration have varied from period to period as a result of the addition of new contracts  expiration of existing contracts  industry consolidation  the expiration of deferred revenue schedules under existing contracts  and the volumes and prices at which the licensees have recently sold licensed semiconductors to system companies 
these variations are expected to continue in the foreseeable future  although we anticipate that revenue will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of licensees 
the royalties we receive are partly a function of the adoption of our interfaces at the system company level 
many system companies purchase semiconductors containing our interfaces from our licensees and do not have a direct contractual relationship with us 
our licensees generally do not provide detail as to the identity or volume of licensed semiconductors purchased by particular system companies 
as a result  we face difficulty in analyzing the extent to which our future revenues will be dependent upon particular system companies 
system companies face intense competitive pressure in their markets  which are characterized by extreme volatility  frequent new product introductions and rapidly shifting consumer preferences 
there can be no assurance as to the unit volumes of licensed semiconductors that will be purchased by these companies in the future or as to the level of royalty bearing revenues that our licensees will receive from sales to these companies 
additionally  there can be no assurance that a significant number of other system companies will adopt our interfaces or that our dependence upon particular system companies will decrease in the future 
international revenues as previously discussed  for the twelve months ended december   and  international revenues constituted approximately  and of our total revenues  respectively 
we expect that revenues derived from international licensees will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues in the future 
to date  all of the revenues from international licensees have been denominated in us dollars 
however  to the extent that such licensees sales to systems companies are not denominated in us dollars  any royalties that we receive as a result of such sales could be subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
in addition  if the effective price of licensed semiconductors sold by our foreign licensees were to increase as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the relevant currencies  demand for licensed semiconductors could fall  which in turn would reduce our royalties 
we do not use derivative instruments to hedge foreign exchange rate risk 

table of contents for additional information concerning international revenues  see note titled business segments  exports and major customers in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
expenses we intend to continue making significant expenditures associated with engineering  marketing  general and administration including litigation expenses  and expect that these costs and expenses will continue to be a significant percentage of revenues in future periods 
whether such expenses increase or decrease as a percentage of revenues will be substantially dependent upon the rate at which our revenues change 
engineering 
engineering costs are allocated between cost of contract revenues and research and development expenses 
cost of contract revenues is determined based on the portion of engineering costs which have been incurred during the period of the adaptation of our chip to chip interfaces for specific licensee processes 
the balance of engineering costs  incurred for general development of our interfaces  is charged to research and development 
in a given period  the allocation of engineering costs between these two components is a function of the timing of development and implementation cycles 
as a generation of technology matures from the development stage through implementation  the majority of engineering costs shift from research and development expenses to cost of contract revenues 
engineering costs are recognized as incurred and do not correspond to the recognition of revenues under the related contracts 
marketing  general and administrative 
marketing  general and administrative expenses include expenses and costs associated with trade shows  public relations  advertising  legal  finance  insurance and other marketing and administrative efforts 
litigation expenses are a significant portion of our marketing  general and administrative expenses and they can vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
for example  litigation expenses for the fourth quarter ended december  were million as compared to million for the fourth quarter ended december  consistent with our business model  sales and marketing activities are focused on developing relationships with potential licensees and on participating with existing licensees in marketing  sales and technical efforts directed to system companies 
in many cases  we must dedicate substantial resources to the marketing and support of system companies 
due to the long business development cycles we face and the semi fixed nature of marketing  general and administrative expenses in a given period generally are unrelated to the level of revenues in that period or in recent or future periods 
taxes 
we report certain items of income and expense for financial reporting purposes in different years than they are reported for tax purposes 
specifically  we report contract fees and royalties when received for tax purposes  as required by tax law 
for financial reporting purposes  however  we recognize revenues from xdr  flexio  raser and rdram contract fees  assuming collectibility  either ratably over the period post contract customer support is expected to be provided or by using the percentage of completion method of accounting  depending upon the nature of the contract 
we recognize revenues from sdram compatible and ddr compatible license fees  assuming collectibility  over the contract period and recognize royalty revenues upon notification from licensees 
thus  we recognize revenue earlier for tax than for financial reporting purposes 
accordingly  our net operating profit or loss for tax purposes may be more or less than the amount recorded for financial reporting purposes 

table of contents results of operations on april   rambus changed its fiscal year from september to december  effective january  the following discussion of historical operating results compares the twelve months ended december  to the twelve months ended december  and the twelve months ended december  are compared to the twelve months ended december  additionally  the three months ended december  are compared to the three months ended december  and the twelve months ended september  are compared to the twelve months ended september  to enhance comparability  the following table sets forth audited consolidated statements of operations for the twelve months ended december  and the three months ended december  and the twelve months ended september  and the unaudited periods of the twelve months ended december  and the three months ended december  have been derived from our financial statements for the twelve months ended september  and three months ended december  twelve months ended december  three months ended december  twelve months ended september  audited audited unaudited audited unaudited audited audited revenues contract revenues royalties total revenues costs and expenses cost of contract revenues research and development marketing  general administrative total costs and expenses operating income interest and other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income twelve months ended december   and twelve months ended december  to change to change audited audited unaudited total revenues in millions contract revenue royalties total revenues for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in  the increase in contract revenue was due primarily to the increase in recognition of revenue associated with our xdr and flexio contracts approximately million  and raser interface contracts approximately million 
in general  we recognize revenue on xdr and flexio contracts using the percentage of completion method of 
table of contents accounting 
we began recognizing revenue on one of our raser contracts during the quarter ended september  using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
we determine progress to completion using input measures based on labor hours incurred 
the increase in recognition of revenue during was primarily a result of the increase in the amount of work performed under these contracts 
for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in  the increase in contract revenue was primarily due to the increase in recognition of revenue associated with our xdr and flexio interface contracts approximately million 
we currently expect to recognize revenue on our existing raser  xdr and flexio percentage of completion contracts through we believe that contract revenues will continue to fluctuate over time based on our ongoing contractual requirements  the amount of work performed under the contracts accounted for using the percentage of completion method of accounting and the value of new contracts booked over time 
in the twelve months ended december   and  our largest category of royalties was related to the license of our patents for sdram and ddr compatible products 
royalties increased by approximately million for sdram and ddr compatible products in the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in  primarily due to increased shipment volumes of sdram and ddr controllers 
as of december   sdram and ddr compatible royalties were recognized based on a percentage of the licensee s revenue with the exception of two contracts that had been previously amended to allow for fixed quarterly payments until there is a favorable resolution to the pending litigation 
sdram and ddr compatible royalties increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in approximately million  primarily due to increased shipment volumes of sdram controllers and ddr memory 
as of december   royalties were recognized based on a percentage of the licensee s revenue with the exception of one contract that had been previously amended to allow for fixed quarterly payments until there is a favorable resolution to the pending litigation 
for the period of april  through march  there was a second licensee that had been paying a fixed quarterly sum 
as a result of the january  court of appeals decision  the second licensee  who was previously paying a fixed quarterly sum for sdram and ddr compatible royalties  reverted back to paying variable royalties in the quarter ended june  all but one of our sdram and ddr license agreements expire in in the future  we expect total sdram and ddr compatible royalties will continue to vary from period to period based on our success in renewing existing license agreements and adding new licensees  as well as the level of variation in our licensees shipment volumes  sales price  and mix  offset in part by the proportion of licensee payments that are fixed 
the intel patent cross license agreement represented the second largest category of royalties in the twelve months ended december   and royalties under this agreement were unchanged in the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in as well as in the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in we expect to continue recognizing revenue from this agreement through june   at which time  intel will have a paid up license for the use of all of the patents that we own claiming priority prior to september  and for which we own applications as of that date 
payments from licensees shipments of rdram memory chips and controllers that connect to rdram memory chips decreased during the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in by approximately million as a result of decreased shipments of rdram memory chips offset in part by an increase in royalties from rdram controllers 
rdram royalties decreased during the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in approximately million primarily due to decreased shipments of rdram memory chips 
we believe that the decrease in royalties for rdram memory chips for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same periods in  and the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same periods in  was mostly driven by a decline in 
table of contents shipments of rdram memory chips for intel s e chipset 
in the future  we expect rdram royalties will continue to vary from period to period based on our licensees shipment volumes  sales prices  and product mix 
certain semiconductor companies are now marketing semiconductors which combine logic and dram on the same chip 
such technology  called embedded dram  eliminates the need for an external chip to chip memory interface 
the impact of embedded dram on our business is difficult to predict 
if embedded dram were to gain widespread acceptance in the electronics industry  and if new royalty generating contracts were not entered into between us and the manufacturers and or users of the embedded dram products  embedded dram would have a negative impact on the royalties that we receive for the use of our patents 
however  we believe embedded dram does not appear to be gaining significant acceptance in the industry 
we do not currently receive royalties for embedded dram 
there can be no assurance that competition from embedded dram will not increase in the future 
twelve months ended december  to change to change audited audited unaudited engineering costs in millions cost of contract revenues research and development total engineering costs for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in  the increase in total engineering costs was a result of the increase in compensation costs approximately million primarily due to the hiring of approximately additional employees in  amortization costs as part of our purchase of serial link intellectual property from velio during the quarter ended december  approximately million  amortization costs as part of our purchase of serial link intellectual property from cadence during the quarter ended september  approximately million and an increase in patent filing costs approximately million 
for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in  engineering costs increased primarily due to the addition of engineering personnel required to meet milestones in the contracts for xdr and flexio interfaces 
for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in  the increase in cost of contract revenues was primarily a result of an increase in total engineering costs and an increase in the amount of customer specific work associated with raser products approximately million 
for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in  the increase was primarily due to the addition of engineering headcount necessary to fulfill xdr and flexio interface contractual obligations 
we believe that in the future  cost of contract revenues will continue to vary both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue based on the nature of engineering deployed as part of our ongoing contractual requirements in any given period 
for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in  the increase in research and development was primarily a result of the increase in total engineering costs partially offset by the increase in customer specific work associated with raser products 
for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in  the increase was primarily due to the hiring of additional personnel 
we believe that in the future  research and development will continue to vary in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue from period to period based on the nature  timing  and the number of research and development projects underway 
a change in engineering headcount deployment in any given period will also cause research and development spending to vary both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue

for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in the increase in total marketing  general and administrative costs including litigation expense was due to increased litigation expenses approximately million driven primarily by costs associated with the administrative hearing with the ftc  as described in note under litigation and asserted claims of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the future  marketing  general and administrative expenses will vary from period to period based on the trade shows  advertising  legal  and other marketing and administrative activities undertaken  and the change in sales  marketing and administrative headcount in any given period 
litigation expenses are expected to vary from period to period due to the volatility of litigation activities 
we expect such costs will increase in the twelve months ended december  relative to the comparable period in as we continue to engage in simultaneous private litigation in multiple jurisdictions 
twelve months ended december  to change to change audited audited unaudited interest and other income  net in millions interest and other income  net consists primarily of gains on the sale of equity investments and interest income from our investments 
in the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in  the increase in interest and other income  net was primarily due to a gain on the sale of our investment in tessera in approximately million 

table of contents for the twelve months ended december  compared to the increase in interest and other income  net was primarily due to the inclusion in other income of a pre tax gain of million  resulting from the divestiture of rambus s investment in nurlogic which was acquired by artisan components  inc now a part of arm 
twelve months ended december  to change to change audited audited unaudited provision for income taxes in millions in the twelve months ended december   our effective tax rate was as compared with a rate of for the comparable period in the effective tax rate decreased primarily due to state taxes and research and development tax credits

at december   our balance sheet included net deferred tax assets of approximately million  relating primarily to the difference between tax and book treatment of depreciation and amortization  employee stock related compensation expenses and deferred revenue  net operating losses and tax credits 
in the twelve months ended december   we increased our net deferred tax assets by million  mainly due to tax benefits from the exercise of employee stock options and the capitalization of research and development for federal and state tax returns 
the deferred tax asset valuation allowance is subject to periodic adjustment as facts and circumstances warrant 
the ability to realize the deferred tax asset is dependant on sufficient levels of future taxable income and other factors 
three months ended december  and three months ended december  to change audited unaudited total revenues in millions contract revenue royalties total revenues revenues were million and million in the three months ended december  and  respectively 
contract revenues were million and million in the three months ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in contract revenues was due largely to the expiration of revenue recognition periods for several contracts 
this decrease was partially offset by increased contract revenues for raser interface technologies and the first revenues for xdr interface technologies 
royalty revenues were and million in the three months ended december  and  respectively 
our largest category of royalties was the intel cross license agreement 
the royalties for this agreement were unchanged in the three months ended december  when compared to the three months ended december  the next largest category of royalties is from licensees for the use of rambus patents and intellectual property in sdram and ddr compatible products 
royalties increased for sdram and ddr compatible products primarily due to increased royalties on shipments of sdram controllers

the final category of royalties is from licensees shipments of rdram memory chips and controllers that connect to rdram memory chips 
the increase in revenues in the three months ended december  when compared to the three months ended december  is caused by growth in unit volumes shipped 
this volume growth was partially offset by declines in asps for rdram memory chips

cost of contract revenues were million and million in the three months ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in the cost of contract revenues in the three months ended december   was primarily due to the fulfillment of contract commitments 
this resulted in the reassignment of engineering resources to research and development activities 
research and development expenses were million and million  in the three months ended december  and  respectively 
research and development expenses increased in three months ended december  as compared to three months ended december  research and development expenses increased as investment increased in the raser  xdr and redwood interfaces  including the reassignment of engineering resources to research and development activities as well as increased compensation costs related to salary increases and the hiring of additional engineering personnel 
three months ended december  to change audited unaudited marketing  general and administrative costs in millions marketing  general and administrative expenses were million and million in the three months ended december  and  respectively

contract revenues decreased to million in the twelve months ended september  the decrease in contract revenues in the twelve months ended september  is due largely to the completion of contract commitments for several rdram contracts 
in the twelve months ended september   royalties decreased to million  including a decline in royalties for sdram and ddr compatible products 
the decline in royalties for sdram and ddr compatible products was partially offset by increased licensees shipments of rdram memory chips and memory controllers that connect to rdram memory chips  primarily due to the success of the sony playstation in addition  royalties in the twelve months ended september  reflect the first full year of royalties received under the intel cross license agreement which was signed in september in the three months ended march   due to the adverse litigation results in  we agreed to an amended fixed royalty agreement with a small licensee for sdram and ddr compatible products

cost of contract revenues were million and million in the twelve months ended september  and  respectively 
the decrease in the cost of contract revenues in the twelve months ended september  was primarily due to the successful launch and ramp of rdram semiconductors into the pc main memory market resulting in a reduction in engineering support efforts 
this resulted in the reassignment of engineering resources to research and development activities 
research and development expenses were million and million  in the twelve months ended september  and  respectively

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  investments  income taxes  litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues consist of royalty revenues and contract revenues generated from the following five types of agreements with semiconductor and systems companies sdram and ddr compatible licenses  which are licenses that cover the use of our patents and other intellectual property in sdram and ddr memory chips and controllers which control such memory a patent cross license with intel xdr and flexio licenses  which are licenses for chips fully compatible with our xdr and flexio interfaces  raser licenses  which are licenses for our raser interface that licensees integrate into their logic semiconductors  and rdram licenses  which are licenses for chips fully compatible with our rdram memory interface 
we do not recognize contract revenues in excess of cash received if collectibility is not probable 
the excess of contract fees billed over revenue recognized is shown on the balance sheet as deferred revenue 
we recognize royalty revenues upon notification by our licensees if collectibility is probable 
the terms of the royalty agreements generally require licensees to give us notification and to pay us royalties within days of the end of the quarter during which the sales occur 
we engage accounting firms independent of our independent registered public accounting firm to perform  on our behalf  periodic audits of some of our licensee s reports of royalties to us and any adjustment resulting from such royalty audits is recorded in the period such adjustment is determined 
sdram compatible and ddr compatible licenses 
sdram compatible and ddr compatible licenses generally provide for the payment of fees  which include compensation for use of our patents from the time we notify the licensee of potential infringement 
accordingly  these fees are classified as royalty revenues  which are recognized ratably over the contract period  which is typically five years 
the current contracts will begin to expire in march intel cross license 
in september  we entered into a cross license agreement with intel that grants intel a license to our patent portfolio 
we recognize revenue from this arrangement on a quarterly basis as amounts become due and payable 
the agreement terminates in september and after that date intel will have a paid up license for the use of all of the patents that we own claiming priority prior to september  and for which we own applications as of that date 
the final payment on this agreement is expected to occur in the second quarter of xdr and flexio licenses 
xdr and flexio interface licenses currently provide for the payment of license fees and engineering fees  as well as royalties 
generally  we recognize license and engineering fees on xdr and flexio licenses using the percentage of completion method of accounting in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants  or aicpa  statement of position  accounting for performance of 
table of contents construction type and certain production type contracts 
we determine progress to completion using input measures based on labor hours incurred 
a provision for estimated losses on fixed price contracts is made  if necessary  in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we review assumptions regarding the work necessary to complete projects on a quarterly basis 
if we determine that it is necessary to revise our estimates of the work required to complete a contract  the total amount of revenue recognized over the life of the contract would not be affected 
however  to the extent the new assumptions regarding the total amount of work necessary to complete a project were less than the original assumptions  the contract fees would be recognized sooner than originally expected 
conversely  if the new estimated total amount of work necessary to complete a project was longer than the original assumptions  the contract fees would be recognized over a longer period 
part of these xdr and flexio license contract fees may be due upon the achievement of certain milestones  such as provision of certain deliverables by us or production of chips by the licensee 
the remaining fees are due on pre determined dates and generally include significant up front fees 
raser licenses 
raser interface licenses provide for the payment of license fees  engineering fees and royalties 
generally  license and engineering fees are recognized ratably over the period during which the post contract customer support periods are expected to be provided  independent of the payment schedules under the contract 
post contract customer support is evaluated on a case by case basis 
revenue on one contract is being recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
we determine progress to completion using input measures based on labor hours incurred 
a provision for estimated losses on fixed price contracts is made  if necessary  in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we review assumptions regarding the work necessary to complete projects on a quarterly basis 
if we determine that it is necessary to revise our estimates of the work required to complete a contract  the total amount of revenue recognized over the life of the contract would not be affected 
however  to the extent the new assumptions regarding the total amount of work necessary to complete a project were less than the original assumptions  the contract fees would be recognized sooner than originally expected 
conversely  if the new estimated total amount of work necessary to complete a project was longer than the original assumptions  the contract fees would be recognized over a longer period 
rdram licenses 
rdram licenses provide for the payment of license fees  engineering fees and royalties 
generally  license and engineering fees are recognized ratably over the period during which the post contract customer support is expected to be provided  independent of the payment schedules under the contract 
post contract customer support periods are evaluated on a case by case basis 
rdram licenses generally allow a semiconductor manufacturer to use our rdram memory interface and to receive engineering implementation services and customer support 
we deliver to a new rdram licensee an implementation package  which contains the information needed to develop a chip incorporating our rdram memory interface into the licensee s process 
an implementation package includes a specification  generalized circuit layout database software for the particular version of the chip which the licensee intends to develop  test parameter software and  for memory chips  a core interface specification 
test parameters are the programs that test the rdram interface embedded in the customer s product 
some licensees have contracted to have us provide the specific engineering implementation services required to optimize the generalized circuit layout for the licensee s manufacturing process 
the rdram licenses also provide for the right to receive ongoing customer support  which includes technical advice on chip specifications  enhancements  debugging and testing 
other than the licenses using percentage of completion  we recognize revenue on our other interface licenses in accordance with the aicpa statement of position  or sop  sop and sop  software revenue recognition 
these sops apply to all entities that earn revenue on products containing software  where software is not incidental to the product as a whole 
contract fees for the products and services provided under these agreements are comprised of license fees and engineering service fees 
contract fees are bundled together as the total price of the agreement does not vary as a result of inclusion or exclusion of services and vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  for the undelivered element has not been established 
accordingly  the revenues from such contracts are recognized ratably over the period during which the post contract customer support is expected to be provided independent of the payment schedules under the contract  including milestones 
at the time we begin to 
table of contents recognize revenue under an interface license  the remaining obligations are no longer significant 
these remaining obligations are primarily to keep the product updated and include activities such as responding to inquiries and periodic customer meetings 
part of these contract fees may be due upon the achievement of certain milestones  such as provision of certain deliverables by us or production of chips by the licensee 
the remaining fees are due on pre determined dates and include significant up front fees 
we review assumptions regarding the post contract customer support periods on a regular basis 
if we determine that it is necessary to revise our estimates of the support periods  the total amount of revenue recognized over the life of the contract would not be affected 
however  if the new estimated periods were shorter than the original assumptions  the contract fees would be recognized ratably over a shorter period 
conversely  if the new estimated periods were longer than the original assumptions  the contract fees would be recognized ratably over a longer period 
litigation as of december   we are involved in certain legal proceedings  as discussed in note titled litigation and asserted claims of our consolidated financial statements 
based upon consultation with the outside counsel handling our defense in these matters and an analysis of potential results  we have not accrued any amounts for potential losses related to these proceedings 
because of uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the pending litigation  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation 
we will record accruals for losses if and when we determine the negative outcome of such matters to be probable and reasonably estimable 
our estimates regarding such losses could differ from actual results 
revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows 
we recognize litigation expenses in the period in which the litigation services were provided 
marketable securities we classify all of our marketable securities as available for sale 
we carry these investments at fair value  based on quoted market prices  and unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of taxes  which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses are recorded in our consolidated statement of operations 
if we believe that an other than temporary decline exists  it is our policy to record a write down to reduce the investments to fair value and record the related charge as a reduction of interest income 
income taxes as part of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to calculate the income tax expense or benefit which relates to the pretax income or loss for the period 
in addition  we are required to assess the realization of the tax asset or liability to be included on the consolidated balance sheet as of the reporting dates 
this process requires us to calculate various items including permanent and temporary differences between the financial accounting and tax treatment of certain income and expense items  differences between federal and state tax treatment of these items  the amount of taxable income reported to various states  foreign taxes and tax credits 
the differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes results in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included on our consolidated balance sheet 
at december   our balance sheet included net deferred tax assets of approximately million  relating primarily to the difference between tax and book treatment of depreciation and amortization  employee stock related compensation expenses and deferred revenue  net operating loss carryovers and tax credits 
we have established a partial valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of certain assets 
the valuation allowance as of december  of approximately million relates primarily to the tax benefit of the employee stock related compensation expense 

table of contents the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from the estimates or we adjust the estimates in future periods  an additional valuation allowance may have to be recorded  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operation 
recent accounting pronouncements see note under summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
short term and long term marketable securities are generally classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of estimated tax 
investments in fixed rate interest earning instruments carry varying degrees of interest rate risk 
the fair market value of our fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
in general  securities with longer maturities are subject to greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities 
due in part to this factor  our investment income may fall short of expectations or we may suffer losses in principal if securities are sold that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates
