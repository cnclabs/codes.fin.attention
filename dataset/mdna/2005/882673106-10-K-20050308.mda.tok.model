mortgage servicing rights 
the company also considers the accounting estimates used in evaluating the carrying value of the mortgage servicing rights to be critical 
the company evaluates the carrying value of the mortgage servicing rights for impairment based upon the fair value of those rights 
impairment is determined by stratifying rights by predominant characteristics  such as interest rates  terms and type fixed or adjustable 
fair value of mortgage servicing rights is determined by discounting the present value of the estimated future net servicing revenues using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved based on management s best estimate of remaining loan lives 
this method of valuation incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in their estimate of future servicing income and expense  including assumptions about prepayments  defaults and interest rates 
at december   the fair value was based on the present value of future cash flows using prepayment speeds ranging from to of standard public securities association prepayment speeds  discount rates ranging from to and weighted average lives ranging from to years

approvals for the extension or renewal of loans without reduction of principal for more than one twelve month period are generally avoided  unless the loans are fully secured and properly margined by cash or marketable securities  or are revolving lines subject to annual analysis and renewal 
nonperforming assets the company has several procedures in place to assist in maintaining the overall quality of its loan portfolio 
the bank has established underwriting guidelines to be followed by its officers and monitors its delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends 
nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming impaired loans and other assets  primarily real estate  acquired in partial or full satisfaction of loan obligations 
nonperforming loans include loans that are on nonaccrual status or that have been restructured 
the company s policy generally is to place a loan on nonaccrual status when payment of principal or interest is contractually past due days  or earlier when concern exists as to the ultimate collection of principal and interest 
at the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  interest previously accrued but uncollected is reversed and charged against current income unless the collateral provides more than adequate margin to ensure collection of that interest 
a restructured loan is generally a loan that is accruing interest  but on which concessions in terms have been made as a result of deterioration in the borrower s financial condition 
the company s classification of nonperforming loans includes those loans for which management believes collection is doubtful 
management is not aware of any specific borrower relationships that are not reported as nonperforming where management has serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms which would cause nonperforming assets to increase materially 
nonperforming assets of  at december  increased  or compared to december  levels of  nonperforming assets decreased as a percentage of total assets from at december  to at december  during  nonperforming assets decreased  or compared with december  levels of  nonaccrual loans of  at december  increased  or compared to december  levels of  the increase was primarily the result of the addition of twelve loan relationships totaling  the increase was partially offset by a total of  paid off from one loan relationship as of december  nonaccrual loans of  at december  decreased  or compared to december  levels of  the decrease resulted primarily from one loan relationship in which  was either charged off or transferred to foreclosed and other assets 
foreclosed and other assets of  at december  decreased  or compared to december  levels of  the decrease in foreclosed and other assets during was primarily attributable to the sale of two large properties totaling  management actively seeks buyers for all other real estate 
see noninterest expense below 
loans which are contractually past due days or more  which are both well secured or guaranteed by financially responsible third parties and in the process of collection  generally are not placed on nonaccrual status 
the amount of such loans past due days or more at december   and that are not classified as nonaccrual totaled   and  respectively 
the increase in accruing loans past due days or more at december  compared to december  was primarily a result of the addition of four loan relationships totaling  the increase was partially offset by one loan relationship totaling  that was either current or paid off as of december  the ratio of nonperforming assets plus accruing loans days or more past due as a percent of loans held for investment and foreclosed and other assets at december  increased to from at december  an analysis of the components of nonperforming assets for each of the last five years follows december  nonperforming assets dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans restructured loans nonperforming loans foreclosed and other assets total nonperforming assets accruing loans days or more past due total nonperforming assets and accruing loans days or more past due nonperforming loans as a percentage of loans held for investment nonperforming assets as a percentage of loans held for investment and foreclosed and other assets nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets nonperforming assets plus accruing loans days or more past due as a percentage of loans held for investment and foreclosed and other assets management regularly reviews and monitors the loan portfolio to identify borrowers experiencing financial difficulties 
management believes that  at december   all such loans had been identified and included in the nonaccrual  renegotiated or days or more past due loan totals reflected in the table above 
management continues to emphasize maintaining a low level of nonperforming assets and returning nonperforming assets to an earning status 
allowance for loan losses critical accounting policy management analyzes the loan portfolio to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the appropriate provision required to maintain an adequate allowance 
estimating the allowance is a critical accounting policy 
it is subjective in nature and requires material estimates that may be subject to revision as facts and circumstances warrant 
the company s allowance for loan losses represents estimations based on guidance provided by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  as amended by statement no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures an amendment of fasb statement no 
or statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
in assessing the adequacy of the allowance  management reviews the size  quality and risks of loans in the portfolio and considers factors such as specific known risks  past experience  the status and amount of nonperforming assets and economic conditions 
a specific percentage is allocated to total loans not specifically reserved while additional amounts are added for individual loans considered to have specific loss potential 
loans identified as losses are charged off 
in addition  the loan review committee of the bank reviews the assessments of management in determining the adequacy of the bank s allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis 
based on total allocations  the provision is recorded to maintain the allowance at a level deemed appropriate by management based on probable losses in the loan portfolio 
there can be no assurance that future additions or reductions to the allowance will not be necessary 
the allowance for loan losses at december  totaled  representing a net increase of  or compared to  at december  the acquisition of southeast texas during first quarter attributed to  of the increase 
the remaining increase of is primarily attributable to internal loan growth of since december  management believes that the allowance for loan losses at december  adequately reflects the probable losses in the loan portfolio 
state and federal bank regulatory authorities  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the bank to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination

liquidity management assures that adequate funds are available to meet deposit withdrawals  loan demand and maturing liabilities 
insufficient liquidity can result in higher costs of obtaining funds  while excessive liquidity can lead to a decline in earnings due to the cost of foregoing alternative investments 
the ability to renew and acquire additional deposit liabilities is a major source of liquidity 
the company s principal sources of funds are primarily within the local markets of the bank and consist of deposits  interest and principal payments on loans and securities  sales of loans and securities and borrowings 
cash and assets which are readily marketable  or which can be pledged  or which will mature in the near future  provide asset liquidity 
these include cash  interest bearing deposits  federal funds sold  time deposits  us treasury  us government agency and mortgage backed securities

the company does not have  nor does it solicit  brokered deposits 
foreign deposits comprise a stable portion of the deposit base  representing of deposits at december  federal funds purchased and short term borrowings are additional sources of liquidity 
at december   the company had lines of credit totaling  with correspondent banks for short term liquidity needs 
in addition  the company had available credit of approximately  from the federal home loan bank  of which  was advanced at december  these sources of liquidity are short term in nature and are used  as necessary  to fund asset growth and meet short term liquidity needs 
the company enters into contractual commitments to extend credit  normally with a fixed expiration date  at specified rates and for specific purposes 
all of the company s commitments are contingent upon the customer maintaining specific credit standards at the time of the loan funding 
at december   the company had outstanding commitments to extend credit of approximately  commercial letters of credit of  standby letters of credit of  and credit card guarantees of  in addition  the company had construction and real estate commitments of  at december  during  funds for  of securities purchased and  of net loan growth came from various sources  including  of proceeds from security sales and maturities  a net increase in deposits of  a net increase in other borrowed money of  net cash provided from acquisitions of  and  from operating activities

applicable federal reserve board regulations provide that bank holding companies are permitted by regulatory authorities to pay cash dividends on their common or preferred stock if consolidated earnings and consolidated capital are within regulatory guidelines 
at december   an aggregate of  was available for payment of dividends by the bank to the company under the applicable limitations and without regulatory approval 
effects of inflation financial institutions are impacted differently by inflation than are industrial companies 
while industrial and manufacturing companies generally have significant investments in inventories and fixed assets  financial institutions ordinarily do not have such investments 
as a result  financial institutions are generally in a better position than industrial companies to respond to inflationary trends by monitoring the spread between interest costs and interest income yields through adjustments of maturities and interest rates of assets and liabilities 
in addition  inflation tends to increase demand for loans from financial institutions as industrial companies attempt to maintain a constant level of goods in inventory and assets 
as consumers of goods and services  financial institutions are affected by inflation as prices increase  causing an increase in costs of salaries  employee benefits  occupancy expense and similar items

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which the company is exposed is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk occurs when assets and liabilities reprice at different times as interest rates change 
for example  if fixed rate loans are funded with floating rate deposits  the spread between loan and deposit rates will decline or turn negative if rates increase 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities 
the company s interest rate risk arises from transactions entered into for purposes other than trading 
the company does not currently engage in trading activities or use derivative instruments to control interest rate risk 
even though such activities may be permitted with the approval of the board of directors  the company does not intend to engage in such activities in the immediate future 
interest rate risk is managed within the funds management policy of the company 
the principal objectives of the funds management policy are to avoid fluctuating net interest margins and to maintain consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
the board of directors oversees implementation of strategies to control interest rate risk 
the company may take steps to alter its net sensitivity position by offering deposit and or loan structures that tend to counter the natural rate risk profile of the company 
funding positions are kept within predetermined limits designed to ensure that risk taking is not excessive and that liquidity is properly managed 
because of the volatility of market rates and uncertainties  there can be no assurance of the effectiveness of management programs to achieve a targeted moderation of risk 
in order to measure earnings and fair value sensitivity to changing rates  the company utilizes three different measurement tools including static gap analysis  simulation earnings  and market value sensitivity fair value at risk 
the primary analytical tool used by the company to quantify interest rate risk is a simulation model to project changes in net interest income that result from forecast changes in interest rates 
this analysis estimates a percentage of change in net interest income from the stable rate scenario under scenarios of rising and falling market interest rates over a twelve month time horizon 
the prime rate serves as a driver and is made to rise or fall evenly in basis point increments over the month forecast interval 
these simulations incorporate assumptions regarding balance sheet growth and mix  pricing and the repricing and maturity characteristics of the existing and projected balance sheet 
the following table summarizes the simulated change in net interest income over a month period as of december  and december  increase decrease in net interest income changes in interest rates basis points estimated net interest income amount percent dollars in thousands december  december  all the measurements of risk described above are made based upon the company s business mix and interest rate exposures at the particular point in time 
an immediate basis point decline in interest rates is a hypothetical rate scenario  used to calibrate risk  and does not necessarily represent management s current view of future market developments 
because of uncertainties as to the extent of customer behavior  refinance activity  absolute and relative loan and deposit pricing levels  competitor pricing and market behavior  product volumes and mix  and other unexpected changes in economic events impacting movements and volatility in market rates  there can be no assurance that simulation results are reliable indicators of net interest income under such conditions 
the interest rate sensitivity gap represents the dollar amount of difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities scheduled to mature or reprice within a given time period gap 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of rate sensitive liabilities and is considered negative when the amount of rate sensitive liabilities exceeds rate sensitive assets 
during periods of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income by reducing the interest rate margin  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during periods of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income by increasing the interest rate margin  while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
a gap ratio is determined by dividing rate sensitive assets by rate sensitive liabilities within such time period 
a ratio of indicates a perfectly matched position  in which case the effect on net interest income due to interest rate movements would be minimal 
a simple interest rate sensitivity analysis may not be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates 
the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income 
certain assets  such as variable rate loans  have features generally referred to as interest rate floors and interest rate caps which limit changes in interest rates over the life of the asset 
in the event of a change in interest rates  loan prepayments and early withdrawal levels on time deposits could deviate significantly from those assumed in the interest rate sensitivity analysis 
the following table summarizes interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities by their repricing dates at december  interest rate sensitivity analysis months months months years over years total dollars in thousands loans held for investment loans held for sale securities available for sale held to maturity interest bearing and time deposits total interest bearing assets savings money market checking and savings accounts time deposits other borrowed money total interest bearing liabilities rate sensitivity gap cumulative rate sensitivity gap cumulative rate sensitivity gap as a percentage of total assets ratio of cumulative rate sensitive interest earning assets to cumulative rate sensitive interest bearing liabilities rate sensitive interest earning assets less rate sensitive interest bearing liabilities
