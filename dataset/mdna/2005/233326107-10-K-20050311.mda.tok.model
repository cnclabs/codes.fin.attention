janus capital group inc janus share exchange on december  the company completed an exchange transaction with janus the janus exchange under which the company received from janus million shares of company common stock of the outstanding shares in exchange for all of the stock of a company subsidiary  dst output marketing services  inc oms  which was part of the company s output solutions segment 
at the time of the janus exchange  oms held an operating sheet fed offset commercial printing  graphics design  laser printing and fulfillment business and additional cash to equalize the value of the oms operating business and the company shares being exchanged 
based on the average closing price of the company s common stock and the terms of an august  exchange agreement between the company  janus and oms the exchange agreement  the exchange value used for the company shares received in connection with the janus exchange was per share 
under the terms of the exchange agreement  the oms operations business had a negotiated value of million and its assets at closing included additional cash of million 
for financial reporting purposes  million company shares were valued at representing the cash element of the exchange transaction while the remaining million shares were valued at representing the exchange value of oms business based on the closing price of company common stock on december  
accordingly  the company recognized a gain for financial reporting purposes of million from the janus exchange 
the janus exchange was structured as a tax free split off in accordance with sections a d and of the internal revenue code 
the company has accounted for the transaction as a tax free reorganization based on two separate tax opinions the tax opinions concerning the transaction 
the tax opinions are not binding on the irs 
as a result  it is possible that the irs could take a position contrary to the tax opinions 
if the irs were to take such a contrary position and prevail  then the company could be required to recognize a gain on the janus exchange as if the company sold the oms shares for fair market value 
the company estimates  that under those circumstances  it would recognize a tax gain of approximately million and would incur federal and state income tax liabilities of approximately million 
the company has not made any provision in its financial statements for income taxes and related interest expense in connection with the possibility that the transaction may not be viewed as a tax free reorganization by the irs 
oms s operating revenues for the period january through december  and the year ended december  were million and million  respectively 
oms s pre tax earnings for the period january through december  and the year ended december  were million and million  respectively 
oms has approximately employees 
the exchange agreement subjects the company to non compete provisions with respect to certain business products of oms  currently known as capital group partners  inc d b a rapid solutions group  for a period of five years after the december  transaction closing date 
the million shares of the company s common stock received from the janus exchange were covered under a separate authorization and were not part of the company s existing authorized share repurchase programs 
under terms of the company s november syndicated line of credit  which was issued in connection with the financing of the janus exchange  the million shares were retired and contractually required not to be reissued during the term of the credit facility 
this has the effect of reducing the company s authorized capital from million to million shares 
convertible debt offering in august the company issued convertible debentures in order to partially finance the janus exchange 
the company issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior debentures  consisting of million of series a convertible senior debentures due and million aggregate principal amount of series b convertible senior debentures due the series a debentures and series b debentures bear interest at a rate of and per annum  respectively 
interest is payable initially in cash semiannually in arrears on february and august  beginning february  until august  for the series a debentures and beginning february  until august  for the series b debentures 
beginning august  for the series a debentures and august  for the series b debentures  the company will not pay regular cash interest on the debentures prior to maturity 
instead  the original principal amount of each debenture will increase daily at a rate of per year series a and per year series b to  and  respectively  which is the full accreted principal amount payable at maturity for each  original principal amount of series a debentures and series b debentures  respectively 
the company will pay contingent interest on the series a debentures and series b debentures during any six month interest period commencing with the period from august  and  respectively  to february  and  respectively  and thereafter from february to august or august to february  for which the average trading price of the debentures for the applicable five trading day reference period equals or exceeds of the accreted principal amount of the debentures 
beginning august  series a and august  series b  the company may redeem for cash all or part of the debentures at any time at a redemption price equal to the accreted principal amount of the debentures to be redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid cash interest  including contingent interest and liquidated damages  if any  to the redemption date 
debenture holders may require the company to purchase the debentures on august    and series a and august    and series b at a purchase price equal to the accreted principal amount of the debentures to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid cash interest  including contingent interest and liquidated damages  if any  to such purchase date 
for purchases of series a debentures on august  and for purchases of series b debentures on august   the company will pay cash 
for purchases of series a debentures on august  and  and for purchases of series b debentures on august  and  the company may elect to pay in cash  common stock or any combination thereof 
the debentures are contingently convertible into shares of the company s common stock during any calendar quarter and only during such calendar quarter if the closing price of the company s common stock  for at least trading days during a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the previous calendar quarter  is greater than or equal to of the applicable conversion price per share 
the debentures are convertible under specified circumstances into shares of the company s common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of debentures which is equal to an initial conversion price of  subject to adjustment 
upon conversion  the company will have the right to deliver  in lieu of shares of its common stock  cash or a combination of cash and shares of common stock 
the debentures if converted into common stock upon the occurrence of certain events would lead to the issuance of common stock and have a potentially dilutive effect on the company s stock 
the company intends to settle any conversions with cash for the principal and accrued and unpaid interest and issue common stock for any conversion value amount over the principal and accrued and unpaid interest amounts

the company is limited  on an annual basis  to making dividends and repurchasing or redeeming its capital stock and or settling of forward equity transactions in an aggregate amount in any fiscal year in an amount not to exceed of consolidated net tangible assets 
in december  the agreement was amended to allow an additional million of share repurchases in from the after tax proceeds of the equiserve sale 
the company could also be limited in making dividends based on certain net worth calculations under the company s syndicated line of credit 
the company was in compliance with these provisions at december  in the event of default  which includes  but is not limited to  a default in performance of covenants  default in payment of principal of loans or change of control  as defined in the revolving credit facility  the syndicated lenders may elect to declare the principal and interest under the syndicated line of credit as due and payable and in certain situations automatically terminate the syndicated line of credit

equiserve restructuring a restructuring provision of million was recorded in for employee severances related to the company s acquisition of equiserve 
the restructuring provision for employee severance costs  which affected employees across nearly all classifications and locations  related to approximately employees  which were separated from the company as of december  dst output restructuring the output solutions segment consolidated its operations into three primary facilities and closed certain other smaller facilities 
the segment recorded a charge associated with facility and other consolidations of million for the year ended december   including million of employee severances for approximately involuntarily terminated employees across nearly all classifications and locations 
severance costs of million  million and million were paid in  and  respectively for approximately employees  which were separated from the company as of december  approximately million of severance reserve relating to approximately employees was not required due to attrition  accordingly  this amount was reversed to cost and expenses in facility closure and relocation costs of million  million and million were incurred in  and  respectively 
approximately million in facility closure and relocation costs were not required due to being able to vacate certain locations quicker than anticipated  accordingly  this amount was reversed to cost and expenses in leasehold write offs and asset impairments of million were recorded during other period costs of million and million were expensed as incurred during and no other period costs were paid in new mutual fund clients in  the company received commitments from five prospective clients with a total of million shareowner accounts and  k plan participants 
the conversions are planned to occur throughout termination of employee stock option reload feature the company s stock option plan permits option holders to use company shares to exercise their options  and also contains a feature that allows for reload stock options 
the reload feature was included in stock options granted from february  through october  to encourage associates to accumulate stock ownership through periodic exercises of stock options using company shares owned 
the reload feature provided for an automatic grant of a new stock option at the then current market price for the number of company shares tendered in the exercise and the number of company shares withheld to satisfy income tax withholdings 
under its current accounting policies at the time  the company was not required to record a compensation charge for stock option grants and automatic grants of reload stock options 
under proposed accounting rules being discussed at the time  the financial accounting standards board fasb had determined that  for accounting purposes  all reload stock option grants would be treated as new grants and would therefore require a separate compensation charge for each reload grant 
this accounting treatment created an uncertainty surrounding both the timing and amount of compensation expense associated with reload stock option activity because the company would be unable to control or estimate how many reloadable stock options could be exercised in the future  or the impact on the company s financial statements of the expensing of reload options 
the compensation committee of the company s board of directors determined that it was in the best interest of the company to eliminate this uncertainty from future financial results 
the reload feature was removed from all outstanding stock options in the fourth quarter options with reload features covered approximately million shares of company stock 
the company compensated optionees who had reload stock options for the termination of the reload feature from their stock options 
the compensation was paid in one of two forms 
optionees received either cash in december  or the promise to receive a fixed number of shares of company stock in the future 
the form of compensation depended on the number of reload options held by the optionee 
the company recorded  in the fourth quarter a pre tax charge of approximately million related to the termination of the reload feature from outstanding stock options 
no additional charges are expected in connection with the termination of the reload feature 
the charge has been reflected in costs and expenses for each of the respective segments 
the shares to be issued in the future as compensation for termination of the reload feature are treated as outstanding for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share 
the company does not expect to include a reload feature in any stock options that may be issued in the future 
off balance sheet arrangements an off balance sheet arrangement is any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has made guarantees  a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets  an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the company  or that engages in leasing  hedging or research and development arrangements with the company 
the company has no arrangements of the types described in the first three categories that it believes may have a material current or future effect on its financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  capital expenditures  capital resources  liquidity or results of operations 
certain guarantees that the company does not expect to have a material current or future effect on its financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  capital expenditures  capital resources  liquidity  or results of operations are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
the company may have obligations arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities 
see fin discussion below related to these variable interests 
fin in december  the revised fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
was issued  which requires the consolidation of certain types of entities in which the company absorbs a majority of another entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the other entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interests in the other entity 
these entities are called variable interest entities 
the principal characteristics of variable interest entities are an insufficient amount of equity to absorb the entity s expected losses  equity owners as a group are not able to make decisions about the entity s activities  or equity that does not absorb the entity s losses or receive the entity s residual returns 
variable interests are contractual  ownership or other monetary interests in an entity that change with fluctuations in the entity s net asset value 
as a result  variable interest entities can arise from items such as joint ventures  lease agreements  loan arrangements  guarantees or service contracts 
if an entity is determined to be a variable interest entity  the primary beneficiary must consolidate the entity 
the primary beneficiary is the holder of the variable interests that absorb a majority of the variable interest entity s expected losses or receive a majority of the entity s residual returns in the event no holder has a majority of the expected losses 
there is no primary beneficiary in cases where no single holder absorbs the majority of the expected losses or receives a majority of the residual returns 
the determination of the primary beneficiary is based on projected cash flows at the inception of the variable interests 
with regard to real estate  the company is the lessee in a series of operating leases covering a large portion of its kansas city based leased office facilities 
the lessors are generally joint ventures in which the company has a ownership that have been established specifically to purchase  finance and engage in leasing activities with the joint venture partners and unrelated third parties 
two of the real estate joint ventures  which the company entered into during and  have entered into financing arrangements with the company s wholly owned captive insurance company 
in each case  the other joint venture partner has guaranteed at least of the joint venture s borrowings million at december  from the company s captive insurance company 
the company is generally not the primary beneficiary of the joint ventures if the lease terms are consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease and do not include a residual value guarantee  fixed price purchase options or similar features that disproportionately obligate it to absorb decreases in value or entitle it to participate in increases in the value of the real estate 
the company s analyses of its real estate joint ventures indicate that a large portion of the real estate joint ventures are variable interest entities  however the real estate joint ventures do not need to be consolidated because the company is not the primary beneficiary 
the company entered into two real estate joint ventures during the company has determined that these ventures are not variable interest entities 
with regard to operating joint ventures  the company has formed or entered into operating joint ventures to enter into or expand its presence in target markets 
the company has three significant operating joint ventures  bfds  ifds includes ifds uk  ifds canada and international financial data services  luxembourg  and argus 
each of these operating joint ventures was formed prior to february  the company s fin analyses of these operating joint ventures indicate that none qualify as variable interest entities due to meeting the criteria for the operating joint venture exception in fin accordingly  the company does not consolidate the operating results of these operating joint ventures 
new accounting standards in december  the fasb issued its final standard on accounting for share based payments  statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas no 
r revised 
sfas r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
the cost will be measured based on the fair value of the instruments issued 
sfas no 
r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans 
sfas no 
r replaces sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
as originally issued in  sfas no 
established as preferable the fair value based method of accounting for share based payment transactions with employees 
however  that statement permitted entities the option of continuing to apply the guidance in opinion  as long as the footnotes to financial statements disclosed what net income would have been had the fair value method been applied 
the company will apply sfas no 
r as of the first interim reporting period that begins after june  and expects to use the modified prospective method  effective july   to adopt the standard 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
r  and  based on preliminary analysis  expects to incur approximately million in additional compensation expense from july  through december  as a result of this new accounting standard 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf topic  accounting issues related to certain features of contingently convertible debt and the effect on diluted earnings per share 
the eitf is effective for reporting periods ending after december  under eitf  a company is required to include the effects of contingently convertible bonds in diluted earnings per share from the date of issuance  without considering the impact of the conversion price 
under eitf  the company can still utilize the net share settlement method of calculating shares for the conversion premium if it intends to settle the principal amount of the bonds in cash and any excess value with shares of its common stock 
related to the company s convertible debenture issuance as described earlier  the impact of eitf to the company is that the calculation of diluted earnings per share would begin to include an incremental amount of shares assumed to be issued for the conversion spread if the company s stock price at the end of a quarter exceeds per share 
the company adopted eitf in the fourth quarter of  and because the company s average daily stock price for the quarter did not exceed  there was no impact on the calculation of diluted earnings per share from the adoption of eitf there was no impact on the company s calculated diluted earnings per share for any historical periods due to the adoption of eitf eitf will affect the company s calculation of diluted earnings per share if the company s average daily share price for a quarter is between and per share 
there is a proposed accounting standard that involves an amendment to the sfas no 
 earnings per share that would impact the way the company treats the incremental shares to be issued from the assumed conversion of the million of convertible debentures issued in august in calculating diluted earnings per share 
the proposed amendment  which is designed for convergence with international accounting standards  would require the use of the if converted method from the date of issuance of the convertible debentures 
the proposed amendment would remove the ability of a company to support the presumption that the convertible securities will be satisfied in cash and not converted into shares of common stock 
accordingly  the company s stated intention to settle the conversions with cash for the principal and accrued and unpaid interest and issue common stock for any conversion value amount over the principal and accrued and unpaid interest amounts would no longer be accepted under sfas the proposed amendment to sfas is expected to be issued in the second quarter  and would require retroactive restatement of a company s diluted earnings per share calculations 
this would require the company to restate its and diluted earnings per share calculations 
under the proposed amended sfas if converted method  in calculating diluted earnings per share the company would need to increase net income for the interest expense associated with the convertible debentures  net of tax  and increase the incremental shares assumed to be issued upon conversion to million shares  the amount of shares that would be issued if all million of convertible debentures would be converted to equity 
under this method  diluted earnings per share would have been and for the years ended december  and  respectively  as compared to the reported amounts of and 
the proposed change in accounting principles does not affect the company s ability to ultimately settle the convertible debentures in cash  shares or any combination thereof 
they would affect the calculation of diluted earnings per share during the period the debentures are outstanding 
the estimated impact of this new accounting standard reflects the company s current views 
there may be material differences between these estimates and the actual impact of the standard 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition  results of operations and cash flows are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  software capitalization and amortization  depreciation of fixed assets  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  and accounting for investments 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition the company derives over of its revenues as a result of providing processing and services under contracts 
the majority of the amount is billed on a monthly basis generally with thirty day collection terms 
revenues are recognized for monthly processing and services upon performance of the services 
in the event a portion of the company s revenues are due six months or more from the invoice date  the company accounts for the revenue as not being fixed and determinable 
in these cases  the revenue is recognized as it becomes due 
if a contract includes multiple elements  including one or more undelivered element  or if the agreement includes contingent revenue  the company delays revenue recognition until undelivered elements are delivered and revenue contingencies expire 
the company s standard business practice is to bill monthly for development  consulting and training services on a time and material basis 
there are exceptions  whereby certain commercial arrangements require a fixed fee for development and consulting services 
for fixed fee arrangements  the company recognizes revenue on a percentage of completion basis 
the company derives less than of its revenues from licensing products 
the company licenses its asset management products and its awd product generally to non mutual fund customers and international customers and its intelecable and affinity products to international customers 
software license revenues are recognized at the time the contract is signed  the software is delivered and no future software obligations exist 
deferral of software license revenue billed results from delayed payment provisions  disproportionate discounts between the license and other services or the inability to unbundle certain services 
the company recognizes revenues for maintenance services ratably over the contract term  after collectibility has been assured 
for all revenues  the company assesses collection based on a variety of factors  including past collection history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
the company does not request collateral from its customers 
if it is determined that collection of revenues is not reasonably assured  revenue is deferred and is recognized at the time it becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
allowances for billing adjustments are determined as revenues are recognized and are recorded as reductions in revenues 
doubtful account expense for the company is immaterial 
software capitalization and amortization the company makes substantial investments in software to enhance the functionality and facilitate the delivery of its processing and services as well as its sale of licensed products 
purchased software is recorded at cost and is amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated economic lives of three to five years 
the company also develops a large portion of its software internally 
the company is required to capitalize software development costs under two separate accounting pronouncements 
the first  sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  applies to software that will be sold or delivered to third parties and requires capitalization of research and development costs after technological feasibility has been established and management is committed to funding the project 
the second pronouncement  statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  requires capitalization of certain development costs after the design has been approved and management is committed to funding the project 
the capitalized software development costs are generally amortized on a straight line basis  based on an estimated economic life  which is dependent on the nature of the project 
excluding fairway  the company has assigned lives of three to seven years for capitalized software development 
the company assigned an estimated economic life of years for capitalized fairway development costs  due to management s estimate of when the base functionality will be replaced through enhancements or upgrades 
the company will continue to incur costs related to the new fairway system  however  upon the closing of the pending equiserve sale  these costs will be reimbursable 
the fairway system is expected to be impaired concurrent with the closing of the pending sale of equiserve 
significant management judgment is required in determining what projects and costs associated with software development will be capitalized and in assigning estimated economic lives to the completed projects 
management specifically analyzes software development projects and analyzes the percentage of completion as compared to the initial plan and subsequent forecasts  milestones achieved and the commitment to continue funding the projects

depreciation of fixed assets the company s philosophy on personal property  specifically data processing equipment  is to own the property as opposed to leasing it where practicable 
the company believes this approach provides it better flexibility for disposing or redeploying the asset as it nears the completion of its economic life 
the company depreciates data processing equipment using accelerated depreciation methods over the following lives non mainframe equipment three years  mainframe central processing unit four years  and mainframe direct access storage devices and tape devices five years 
the company depreciates furniture and fixtures over estimated useful lives  principally three to five years  on a straight line basis 
the company depreciates leasehold improvements using the straight line method over the lesser of the term of the lease or life of the improvements 
management judgment is required in assigning economic lives to fixed assets 
management specifically analyzes fixed asset additions  remaining net book values and gain loss upon disposition of fixed assets to determine the appropriateness of assigned economic lives 
significant changes in any of these items may result in changes in the economic life assigned and the resulting depreciation expense 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill the company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that are considered important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when it is determined that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the company measures any impairment based on gross cash flows 
in  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective and  as a result  the company and its unconsolidated affiliates ceased amortizing goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives and  instead  will test for impairment annually 
the company s initial impairment test upon adoption of sfas no 
and subsequent annual impairment tests indicated that there were no impairments 
the fair value of the reporting units was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows 
at december   the company had  million of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill on its consolidated balance sheet 
upon the closing of the pending sale of equiserve  this balance will decrease by million 
accounting for investments the company has two significant types of investments investments in available for sale securities  which are comprised principally of investments in state street and computer sciences corporation csc  and investments in unconsolidated affiliates  which is comprised principally of bfds  ifds uk  ifds canada  argus  wall street access  llc and certain real estate joint ventures 
the company accounts for investments in corporations  for which it owns less than and does not have significant influence  in accordance with sfas no 
under sfas no 
 the company is required to designate its equity investments as trading or available for sale 
at december   the company had approximately billion of available for sale securities 
available for sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and recorded net of deferred taxes directly to stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income 
at december   the company s available for sale securities had gross unrealized holding gains of million and gross unrealized holding losses of million 
the impact of a change in fair value of these investments would be approximately million to comprehensive income 
the company records an investment impairment charge for an investment with a gross unrealized holding loss resulting from a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future  which could have a material effect on the company s financial position 
the equity method of accounting is used for investments in corporations in which the company or its subsidiaries have at least a voting interest and significant influence but do not control and for all investments in partnerships and similar interests in which the company does not control 
the company classifies these investments as unconsolidated affiliates 
under the equity method  the company recognizes  on an equity basis  income or losses from its pro rata share of these unconsolidated affiliates net income or loss  which changes the carrying value of the investment of the unconsolidated affiliate 
in certain cases  pro rata losses are recognized only to the extent of the company s investment and advances to the unconsolidated affiliate 
the company s carrying value of unconsolidated affiliates approximates its pro rata share of the unconsolidated affiliate s net tangible assets 
in  the company recognized a million impairment charge on related to a owned unconsolidated affiliate 
although the company does not expect that it will need to record any additional impairment charges for its investments in unconsolidated affiliates  future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of unconsolidated affiliates could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the unconsolidated affiliate investment that may not be reflected in the investment s carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
this could have a material effect on the company s financial position
