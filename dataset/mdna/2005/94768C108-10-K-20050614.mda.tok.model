in addition to our webmethods fabric product suite  we have a strategy to combine our software capabilities  professional services  strategic partnerships  and domain expertise into well defined solutions that address specific horizontal and vertical industry problems 
our first planned solutions are in the areas of payment and lending processing in the financial services industry  integration in the retail industry and regulatory compliance requirements impacting many organizations 
we market and sell our products and solutions primarily to the largest  corporations worldwide the global and major government agencies 
in our fiscal year ended march   we added approximately new customers  with no single customer accounting for more than of our revenue in any quarter of that fiscal year 
as of march   we had approximately  customers around the world  distributed across our target verticals in manufacturing  process industries such as chemicals  oil and gas  life sciences  metals  paper and plastics  financial services  consumer goods manufacturing and retail  government and telecommunications 
restatements on february   we issued a press release and thereafter filed a form k announcing that we were restating our financial statements for our fiscal year ended march   as well as quarterly financial statements for each of the three interim quarterly reports in that fiscal year and for the three months ended june  that announcement related primarily to the recently completed independent investigation conducted by the audit committee of our board of directors into certain transactions of our japanese subsidiary 
as a result of the investigation  our audit committee concluded that improper activities of certain employees of our japanese subsidiary caused us to misstate revenue and expenses for the year ended march  and certain quarters therein and the three months ended june   as well as misstate accounts receivable  deferred revenue  debt and certain other items attributable to the operations of our japanese subsidiary 
our audit committee s investigation found that the improper activities included  among other things  engaging in improper licensing and professional services transactions and misrepresenting the transactions to our management  causing our japanese subsidiary to engage in undisclosed and unauthorized borrowings  failing to record expenses and recording improper expenses  and creating false documents in support of improper transactions 
our audit committee also determined that those employees of our japanese subsidiary acted to conceal their improper activities from our management 
the adjustments to the our financial statements in the restatements fell into five general categories i adjustments to license  professional services and maintenance revenue relating to improper activities of certain employees of our japanese subsidiary  ii adjustments to deferred revenue with respect to certain of those revenue items that should have been deferred and recognized as revenue in subsequent periods  iii adjustments to properly record expenses of our japanese subsidiary in the appropriate period  iv adjustments to debt excluding the reclassification of interest expense  which was nominal and accounts receivable as a result of certain unauthorized borrowings by our japanese subsidiary that were improperly recorded by it as collections of receivables  and v elimination of a provision for tax expense based upon estimates of the taxable income of our japanese subsidiary 
as a result of the foregoing  our consolidated financial statements for the year ended march  and certain quarters therein and for the three months ended june  and the related consolidated balance sheets as of those dates were restated in february from amounts previously reported 
consequently  the effects of the restatements have been reflected in our consolidated financial statements appearing in this form k  in selected financial data and in the following portions of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures 
we evaluate our estimates  on an ongoing basis  including those related to allowances for bad debts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ for these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we enter into arrangements  which may include the sale of licenses of our software  professional services and maintenance or various combinations of each element 
we recognize revenue based on statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  and modified by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
sop modified sop by requiring revenue to be recognized using the residual method if certain conditions are met 
revenue is recognized based on the residual method when an agreement has been signed by both parties  the fees are fixed or determinable  collection of the fees is probable  delivery of the product has occurred  vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for any undelivered element  and no other significant obligations remain 
revenue allocated to the undelivered elements is deferred using vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the elements and the remaining portion of the fee is allocated to the delivered elements generally the software license 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of webmethods  inc included elsewhere in this report for a more comprehensive discussion of our revenue recognition policies 
judgments we make regarding these items  including collection risk  can materially impact the timing of recognition of license revenue 
policies related to revenue recognition require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
these sources may publish new authoritative guidance which might impact current revenue recognition policies 
we continue to evaluate our revenue recognition policies as new authoritative interpretations and guidance are published  and where appropriate  may modify our revenue recognition policies 
application of our revenue recognition policy requires a review of our license and professional services agreements with customers and may require management to exercise judgment in evaluating whether delivery has occurred  payments are fixed or determinable  collection is probable  and where applicable  if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for undelivered elements of the contract 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates for any period  material differences in the amount and timing of revenue recognized could result 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses which may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments to us 
these allowances are established through analysis of the credit worthiness of each customer with a receivable balance  determined by credit reports from third parties  published or publicly available financial information  customers specific experience including payment practices and history  inquiries  and other financial information from our customers 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce materially different allowance balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
at march  and  the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million respectively 
business combinations we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed  as well as in process research and development ipr d based on their estimated fair values 
such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from license sales  maintenance agreements  consulting contracts  customer contracts  and acquired developed technologies and ipr d projects  and discount rates 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
other estimates associated with the accounting for these acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
goodwill and intangible assets we record goodwill and intangible assets when we acquire other businesses 
the allocation of acquisition cost to intangible assets and goodwill involves the extensive use of management s estimates and assumptions  and the result of the allocation process can have a significant impact on our future operating results 
financial accounting standards board no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which was issued during fiscal year and adopted by us on april   eliminated the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives while goodwill and indefinite lived assets are not amortized under sfas  but are periodically tested for impairment 
in accordance with sfas  all of our goodwill is associated with our corporate reporting unit  as we do not have multiple reporting units 
accordingly on an annual basis we perform the impairment assessment required under sfas at the enterprise level 
we have used the company s total market capitalization to assess the fair value of the enterprise 
if our estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of these assets  which could be substantial 
acquired in process research and development costs to acquire in process research and development technologies which have no alternative future use and which have not reached technological feasibility at the date of acquisition are expensed as incurred see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of webmethods  inc included elsewhere in this report 
foreign currency effects the functional currency for our foreign operations is the local currency 
the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries have been translated into united states dollars 
asset and liability accounts have been translated using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date 
revenue and expense accounts have been translated using the average exchange rate for the period 
the gains and losses associated with the translation of the financial statements resulting from the changes in exchange rates from period to period have been reported in other comprehensive income or loss 
to the extent assets and liabilities of the foreign operations are realized or the foreign operations are expected to pay back the intercompany debt in the foreseeable future  amounts previously reported in other comprehensive income or loss would be included in net income or loss in the period in which the transaction occurs 
transaction gains or losses are included in net income or loss in the period in which they occur 
accounting for income taxes although we believe that our future taxable income may be sufficient to utilize a substantial amount of the benefits of our net operating loss carryforwards and to realize our deferred tax assets  we have recorded a valuation allowance to completely offset the carrying value of the deferred tax assets as we have concluded that the realization of the deferred tax assets does not meet the more likely than not criterion 
if we should determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
restructuring and related charges we have recorded restructuring and related charges to align our cost structure with changing market conditions 
these restructuring and related charges consist of headcount reductions  consolidation and relocation of facilities and related impairment of fixed assets 
excess facility costs related to the consolidation and relocation of facilities are based on our contractual obligations  net of estimated sublease income based on current comparable lease rates 
we reassess this liability each period based on market conditions 
revisions to our estimates of this liability could materially impact our operating results and financial position in future periods if anticipated events and key assumptions  such as the timing and amounts of sublease rental income  either change or do not materialize 
litigation and contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 
results of operations the following table summarizes the results of our operations for each of the past three fiscal years all percentages are calculated using the underlying data in thousands fiscal year ended march  percentage march  percentage march  change change in thousands total revenue gross profit of total revenue total operating expenses of total revenue operating loss of total revenue net loss of total revenue during fiscal year  our total revenue increased to million from million in fiscal year the increase in total revenue was due to increases in professional services and maintenance revenue  partially offset by a decrease in our license revenue 
the decrease in license revenue was due in part to a significant decrease in license revenue in the first fiscal quarter of as many enterprises unexpectedly became more cautious in their enterprise software spending 
the decrease in license revenue can also be attributed in part to lower license revenue in japan due to the disruption caused by the internal investigation and related management changes 
during fiscal year  our total revenue decreased approximately million to million from million in fiscal year as a result of a decrease in license revenue  which was partially offset by increases in professional services and maintenance revenue 
our fiscal year license revenue was negatively impacted by lower than anticipated americas license revenue 
in fiscal year  total revenue included a million positive foreign currency impact from certain international markets  which was partially offset by a million negative foreign currency impact on total cost of revenue and operating expenses  resulting in a positive impact of million to operating loss in fiscal year in fiscal year  total revenue included an million positive foreign currency impact from certain international markets  which was partially offset by a million negative foreign currency impact on total cost of revenue and operating expenses  resulting in a positive impact of million to operating loss in fiscal year our net loss decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year due primarily to an increase in total revenue and a decrease in sales and marketing expenses and other operating expenses

in addition  our license revenue was also impacted by our internal investigation of our japanese subsidiary  which caused disruption in the business and related sales cycles in our third fiscal quarter and  to a lesser extent  in our fourth fiscal quarter 
license revenue for fiscal year was similarly impacted by the spending environment  as well as the impact of our quota bearing sales representatives in the americas being down approximately at the beginning of fiscal year and lower than anticipated license revenue in the americas  particularly in the first half of fiscal year license revenue included a positive foreign currency impact of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively  from certain international markets 
professional services revenue increased by million  or  to million  for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year this increase was primarily due to an increase in the volume and size of customer engagements and to a lesser extent  a million positive foreign currency impact

maintenance revenue increased by million  or  from million to million in fiscal year  and million  or  from million to million in fiscal year this increase is due primarily to the increase in customers licensing our software and the cumulative effect of agreements for post contract maintenance and support  which is recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the contract 
additionally  more customers have moved to our x support plans given the mission critical nature of their projects involving our software 
furthermore  the increase in maintenance revenue was partially due to a positive foreign currency impact of million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year in fiscal year  revenue from the americas increased by million  or  from million to million due to increases in professional services and maintenance revenue  which was partially offset by a decrease in license revenue

gross margin the following table summarizes our gross margin by type of revenue for each of the past three fiscal years fiscal year ended march  march  march  license professional services and maintenance total revenue our total gross margin was in fiscal year as compared to in fiscal year and in fiscal year the decrease in fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease in license revenue as a percent of total revenue  an increase in the total cost of professional services and maintenance as compared to fiscal year and an increase in cost of revenue due to amortization of intangibles of million related to the october acquisitions 
our cost of license revenue consists of royalties for products embedded in our software licensed from third parties 
in addition  we acquired certain technology in fiscal year that resulted in amortization of intangibles in the amount of million in fiscal year and million in fiscal  which is included in our license margin 
the increase in amortization in fiscal year is due to the full year effect of such amortization

recently issued accounting pronouncements in may the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections 
this statement replaces apb and sfas and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
apb previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle

in december the fasb issued revised sfas r  share based payment  which sets forth accounting requirements for share based compensation to employees and requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation 
we currently provide pro forma disclosure of the effect on net income or loss and earnings or loss per share of the fair value recognition provisions of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
under sfas r  such pro forma disclosure will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
sfas r is effective for annual periods beginning after june  and  accordingly  we must adopt the new accounting provisions effective april  and recognize the cost of all share based payments to employees  including stock option grants  in the income statement based on their fair values 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas r on our financial position and results of operations  including the valuation methods and support for the assumptions that underlie the valuation of the awards 
however  we currently believe that the adoption of sfas r will have a material effect on our results of operations 
in december  fasb issued sfas  exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment to apb opinion no 

this statement amends apb to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our investments and foreign currency fluctuations 
we have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk 
we maintain our funds in money market accounts  corporate bonds  commercial paper  treasury notes and agency notes 
our exposure to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates relates primarily to our interest earnings on our cash deposits 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk inasmuch as their fair value will fall if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels prevailing as of march   the fair value of the portfolio would not decline by a material amount 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate risks 
however  we do have an investment policy that would allow us to invest in short term and long term investments such as money market instruments and corporate debt securities 
our policy attempts to reduce such risks by typically limiting the maturity date of such securities to no more than twenty four months with a maximum average maturity to our whole portfolio of such investments at twelve months  placing our investments with high credit quality issuers and limiting the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our exposure to market risk due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to the intercompany balances with our subsidiaries located in australia  canada  china  france  germany  hong kong  india  japan  the netherlands  malaysia  singapore  south korea and the united kingdom 
transaction gains or losses have not been significant in the past  and there is no hedging activity on foreign currencies 
we would not experience a material foreign exchange loss based on a hypothetical adverse change in the price of the euro  great britain pound  singapore dollar  australian dollar  malaysian ringgit  south korean won  canadian dollar  chinese yuan  indian rupee or japanese yen against the us dollar 
consequently  we do not expect that a reduction in the value of such accounts denominated in foreign currencies resulting from even a sudden or significant fluctuation in foreign exchange rates would have a direct material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
notwithstanding the foregoing  the direct effects of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the value of certain of our investments and accounts  and the indirect effects of fluctuations in foreign currency could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  international demand for our products is affected by foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  interest rate fluctuations may affect the buying patterns of our customers 
furthermore  interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations have broad influence on the general condition of the us foreign and global economics  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition results of operations and cash flows
