table of contents through recent acquisitions and the formation of our lenovo asiainfo business unit  we have gained exposure to customers outside of our traditional telecommunications base  although telecommunications customers are still expected to account for approximately of our total revenues in the following discussion describes our primary customers in the telecommunications market  as well as the type of enterprise customers we are targeting in non telecommunications market 
telecommunications customers china mobile

china telecom 
china telecom is the leading provider of fixed line telephone  data and internet and leased line services in four of the most economically developed regions in china 
before the restructurings of the telecommunications industry in china that began in  china telecom  together with its various provincial subsidiaries  constituted our largest customer  accounting for almost all of our revenues in and as part of the industry reorganization completed in may  the northern division of china telecom comprising ten provinces merged with china netcom and jitong communication to form china netcom group 
the southern division comprising twenty one provinces continues to operate under the china telecom name

table of contents sales and marketing sales we classify market segments and target opportunities on national and regional levels 
this classification helps us determine our primary sales targets and prepare monthly and quarterly sales forecasts 
sales quotas are assigned to all sales personnel according to annual sales plans 
we approve target projects  develop detailed sales promotion strategies and prepare reports on order forecast  technical evaluation  sales budgeting expense  schedules and competition analysis 
after a report has been approved  a sales team is appointed consisting of sales personnel  system design engineers and a senior system architect 
for asiainfo technologies  our division focusing on customers in the telecommunication business  our sales organizations are structured into four strategic customer accounts  namely china telecom  china mobile  china netcom and china unicom 
these accounts sell our solutions and services to the respective customers and manage our long term relationship with them 
we also have direct sales personnel in regional offices in beijing  shanghai  chengdu and guangzhou 
as a result  we believe we have increased our organizational efficiency and improved the quality of our services to our clients 
for lenovo asiainfo  our division addressing the enterprise it services market  our sales force is organized by different business units  focusing on management and it consulting  information security solutions  and industrial application solutions 
in addition to the headquarters in beijing  there are also direct sales personnel in regional offices in shanghai  guangzhou and shenzhen

competition we operate in a highly competitive environment  both in the telecommunications market and in the market for enterprise it services and solutions 
in the enterprise market  our competitors are primarily domestic companies such digital china  huawei  linkage  and neusoft 
in the telecommunications market  our competitors include multinational companies such as ibm global services  hp services  oracle  sibel  convergys and sap  which are establishing more active presences in the it services market in china 
in addition  top international consulting companies such as pwc consulting recently acquired by ibm  deloitte consulting  capgemini  accenture  and bearing point  have also entered china s it services market 
we believe that we have competitive advantages in our product and service segments due to our combined international and china expertise  customer centric and cost effective project management capability  and established customer relationships 
our competitors  some of whom have greater financial  technical and human resources than we have  may be able to respond more quickly to new and emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of new products or 
table of contents services 
it is possible that competition in the form of new competitors or alliances  joint ventures or consolidation among existing competitors may decrease our market share 
increased competition could result in lower personnel utilization rates  billing rate reductions  fewer customer engagements  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any one of which could materially and adversely affect our profits and overall financial condition 
government regulation regulation of the telecommunications industry the chinese telecommunications industry  in which most of our largest customers operate  is subject to extensive government regulation and control 
currently  all the major telecommunications and internet service providers in china are primarily state owned or state controlled and their business decisions and strategies are affected by the government s budgeting and spending plans 
in addition  they are required to comply with regulations and rules promulgated from time to time by the ministry of information industry  or mii  and other ministries and government departments 
in september  china published the regulations of the people s republic of china on telecommunications  also known as the telecommunications regulations 
the telecommunications regulations were the first comprehensive set of regulations governing the conduct of telecommunications businesses in china 
in particular  the telecommunications regulations set out in clear terms the framework for operational licensing  network interconnection  the setting of telecommunications charges and standards of telecommunications services in china 
in the same month  china s state council approved the administrative measures on internet information services  which provide for control and censoring of information on the internet 
under regulations introduced in december of  qualified foreign investors are permitted to invest in certain sectors of china s telecommunications industry through sino foreign joint ventures  although there have been few reported investments of this nature to date 
these regulations  known as the provisions on the administration of foreign invested telecommunications enterprises  were the result of china s accession to the wto 
under the provisions  certain qualifying foreign investors will be permitted to own up to of basic telecommunications businesses in china  and up to of value added telecommunications businesses which include internet service providers and internet content providers and wireless paging businesses 
in january   the mii promulgated the administrative measures for telecommunications business operating licenses 
this regulation provides that there are two types of telecommunication operating licenses for operators in the prc  namely licenses for basic services and licenses for value added services 
in april  the ministry of information industry issued a new classification of basic and value added telecommunication services 
the revised classification maintains the general distinction between basic telecommunications services bts and value added telecommunications services vats and attempts to define the scope of each service 
in particular  the classification enumerated the differences between type and type value added services 
type includes online data and transaction processing  domestic multi party communication services  domestic internet virtual private network services and internet data center services 
type covers storage and retransmission e mail  voice mail  facsimile  call centers  internet access and information services 
as prc regulations restrict direct foreign ownership of vats businesses in the prc  in order to comply with these regulations  we have entered into various contractual agreements with certain individuals to set up a domestic company  beijing star vats technologies  inc  or star vats  to conduct value added telecommunications services business in the prc 
star vats has obtained a license for operating value added telecommunications services type  issued by the ministry of information industry in november at present  our product and services offerings in the vats area are still under development 
we anticipate that in the future we will offer customers various type services 

table of contents we anticipate that if we successfully launch our vats products and services  all of our business related to such products and services will be conducted through star vats 
star vats will receive any revenue we generate in the vats business and will make use of the licenses and approvals that are essential to such business 
we do not have any equity interest in star vats  but instead have the right to enjoy economic benefits similar to equity ownership through our contractual arrangements with star vats and its shareholders 
in the opinion of our chinese legal counsel  t c law firm  the contractual arrangements among us  star vats and the shareholders of star vats are in compliance with all existing prc laws and regulations 
there are  however  substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future prc laws and regulations  including regulations governing the validity and enforcement of such contractual arrangements 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that prc government authorities will not ultimately take a view contrary to the opinion of our chinese legal counsel 
if the prc government finds that our contractual arrangements with star vats do not comply with its restrictions on certain foreign invested companies from engaging in vats businesses  we could be subject to severe penalties 
for more information on the regulatory and other risks associated with our contractual arrangements related to star vats  please see the discussion below in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  under the heading certain risks that may affect our operating results and our common stock 
regulation of computer information security products and services the computer information security industry in china includes products and services designed to protect the security of computer information systems  such as international inter connection of computer information networks  commercial encryption  computer virus detection and prevention  and network hacker infringement prevention and treatment 
the state council of china  the ministry of public security and other relevant authorities have promulgated a series of regulations regarding these businesses 
the regulation of people s republic of china on protection of the computer information system security  published in february  was the first law in this regard  and has formed a legal framework for the computer information security industry 
the below discussion provides a description of the other primary regulations applicable to our information security solutions businesses 
regulation of systems integration involving state secrets in  the state secrecy bureau of china promulgated a special rule  known as the administrative measures for qualification of computer information systems integration involving state secrets  which expressly prohibits foreign persons or foreign invested enterprises from engaging in systems integration businesses involving state secrets 
the measures also provides that a company must obtain a qualification certificate for computer information system integration involving state secrets in order to carry on such business 
regulation of commercial encryption businesses the commercial encryption administrative regulation  issued in  is the principal regulation governing the commercial encryption business in china 
commercial encryption refers to encryption technologies and encryption products utilized for encryption protection or security authentication of information that is not related to state secrets 
research  production  sale and use of encryption products in china are supervised by the national encryption administration committee of china 
research and production of commercial encryption products may only be undertaken by companies that are designated by the encryption administration committee 
a company engaged in selling commercial encryption products must obtain a commercial encryption product sales permit for selling such products 
because encryption technology itself is a state secret according to the commercial encryption administrative regulation  encryption technology also fall under businesses regulated by the provisions of the management measures for qualification of computer information systems integration involving state secrets 

table of contents foreign ownership restrictions and license requirements we and our prc operating subsidiaries are considered foreign persons or foreign invested enterprises under prc laws  and are therefore subject to foreign ownership restrictions in connection with our encryption related businesses 
in order to comply with these restrictions  we entered into a series of contractual arrangements in connection with our acquisition of lenovo s it services business 
those arrangements allow us to operate the part of that business that constitutes systems integration involving state secrets including commercial encryption through affiliated entities in which we do not hold a direct equity interest 
we currently operate the restricted businesses through lenovo computer  which is owned by certain subsidiaries of lenovo and has been operating the information security solutions business for more than four years

lenovo computer conducts  and lenovo security will conduct  substantially all of our operations in relation to the restricted businesses  will generate substantially all of our revenue relating to such business and will make use of the licenses and approvals that are essential to such business 
we do not currently have any equity interest in these operating companies  but instead enjoy the economic benefits of equity ownership in such companies through contractual arrangements among lenovo asiainfo technologies  our wholly owned subsidiary  and these affiliated entities and their respective shareholders 
further information on these arrangements is set forth in the section entitled certain relationships and related party transactions in our definitive proxy statement with respect to our annual meeting of stockholders  to be filed with the securities and exchange commission on or about the date of this report 
currently  lenovo computer conducts our operations in relation to the restricted business under certain contractual arrangement with lenovo  which holds a qualification certificate for computer information system integration involving state secrets and a commercial encryption product sales permit 
lenovo security has applied to obtain such a qualification and permit of its own 
in the opinion of our chinese legal counsel  t c law office  and chinese legal counsel to lenovo  tian yuan law firm  the structure of lenovo computer and lenovo security  and the contractual arrangements among lenovo asiainfo technologies  these affiliated entities and their respective shareholders  are in compliance with all existing prc laws and regulations 
there are  however  substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future prc laws and regulations  including regulations governing the validity and enforcement of such contractual arrangements 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that prc government authorities will not ultimately take a view contrary to the opinion of our and lenovo s chinese legal counsels 
if the prc government finds that our contractual arrangements with lenovo computer and lenovo security do not comply with its prohibition on foreign invested companies from engaging in systems integration involving state secrets  we could be subject to severe penalties 
for more information on the regulatory and other risks associated with our contractual arrangements related to lenovo computer and lenovo security  please see the discussion below in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  under the heading certain risks that may affect our operating results and our common stock

intellectual property our success and ability to compete depends in part upon our intellectual property rights  which we protect through a combination of confidentiality arrangements and copyright and trademark and patent registrations 
we have filed five trademark applications with the united states patent and trademark office  three of which have been passed on to registration and two of which are currently pending 
our trademark application covering asiainfo s logo and design has been granted by the trademark bureau of the state administration of industry and commerce in china 
in addition  we have filed three trademark applications with the hong kong trade marks registry for asiainfo s logo  all of which have been passed to registration 
we have filed some patent applications and have acquired some existing patents in the prc for certain hardware products used or developed in our information security business 
we have also filed a patent application in the prc recently in connection with our business intelligence software solutions 
nearly two hundred versions of our software products have been registered with the state copyright bureau in china 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with most of our employees and consultants  and control access to and distribution of our documentation and other licensed information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible 
table of contents for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our licensed services or technology without authorization  or to develop similar technology independently 
since the chinese legal system in general  and the intellectual property regime in particular  is relatively weak  it is often difficult to enforce intellectual property rights in china 
in addition  there are other countries where effective copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited 
policing unauthorized use of our licensed technology is difficult and there can be no assurance that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation or infringement of our proprietary technology 
in addition  litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
a portion of our business involves the development and customization of software applications for customers 
we generally retain significant ownership or rights to use and market such software for other customer projects  where possible 
however  our customers sometimes retain co ownership and rights to use the applications  processes  and intellectual property so developed 
in some cases  we may have no right or only limited rights to reuse or provide these developments in projects involving other customers 
to the extent that we are unable to negotiate contracts which permit us to reuse source codes and methodologies  or to the extent that we have conflicts with our customers regarding our ability to do so  we may be unable to provide similar solutions to our other customers 
employees we have approximately  employees 
we devote significant resources to recruiting professionals with relevant industry experience 
most of our senior management and technical employees are western educated chinese professionals with substantial expertise in information technologies systems integration and application software development 
we believe that our success in attracting and retaining highly skilled technical employees and sales and marketing personnel is largely a product of our commitment to providing a motivating and interactive work environment that features continuous and extensive professional development opportunities  as well as frequent and open communications at all levels of the organization 
our code of ethics in we adopted a code of ethics  or code  which applies to all of our employees

item legal proceedings on december   a securities class action case was filed in new york city against us  certain of our officers and directors and the underwriters of our initial public offering  or ipo 
the lawsuit alleged violations of the federal securities laws and was docketed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york as hassan v 
asiainfo holdings  inc  et al 
the lawsuit alleged  among other things  that the underwriters of our ipo improperly required their customers to pay the underwriters excessive commissions and to agree to buy additional shares of our common stock in the aftermarket as conditions to their purchasing shares in our ipo 
the lawsuit further claimed that these supposed practices of the underwriters should have been disclosed in our ipo prospectus and registration statement 
the suit seeks rescission of the plaintiffs alleged purchases of our common stock as well as unspecified damages 
in addition to the case against us  various other plaintiffs have filed approximately  other  substantially similar class action cases against approximately other publicly traded companies and their ipo underwriters in new york city  which along with the case against us have all been transferred to a single federal district judge for purposes of case management 
on july   together with the other issuer defendants  we filed a collective motion to dismiss the consolidated  amended complaints against the issuers on various legal grounds common to all or most of the issuer defendants 
the underwriters also filed separate motions to dismiss the claims against them 
on october   the court dismissed without prejudice all claims against the individual defendants in the litigation 
the dismissals were based on stipulations signed by those defendants and the plaintiffs representatives 
on february   the court issued its ruling on the motions to dismiss filed by the underwriter and issuer defendants 
in that ruling the court granted in part and denied in part those motions 
as to the claims brought against us under the anti fraud provisions of the securities laws  the court dismissed all such claims without prejudice 
as to the claims brought under the registration provisions of the securities laws  which do not require that intent to defraud be pleaded  the court denied the motion to dismiss such claims as to us and as to substantially all of the other issuer defendants 
the court also denied the underwriter defendants motion to dismiss in all respects 
in june  based on a decision made by a special independent committee of our board of directors  we elected to participate in a proposed settlement agreement with the plaintiffs in this litigation 
if ultimately approved by the court  this proposed settlement would result in a dismissal  with prejudice  of all claims in the litigation against us and against any of the other issuer defendants who elect to participate in the proposed settlement  together with the current or former officers and directors of participating issuers who were named as individual defendants 
the proposed settlement does not provide for the resolution of any claims against the underwriter defendants  and the litigation against those defendants is continuing 
the proposed settlement provides that the class members in the class action cases brought against the participating issuer defendants will be guaranteed a recovery of billion by insurers of the participating issuer defendants 
if recoveries totaling billion or more are obtained by the class members from the underwriter defendants  however  the monetary obligations to the class members under the proposed settlement will be satisfied 
in addition  all participating issuer defendants will be required to assign to the class members certain claims that we may have against the underwriters 
the plaintiffs have filed a motion asking the court to give its preliminary approval to the form of the settlement documents  including the notice of the settlement to be sent to class members 
the proposed settlement contemplates that any amounts necessary to fund the settlement or settlement related expenses would come from participating issuers directors and officers liability insurance policy proceeds as opposed to funds of the participating issuer defendants themselves 
a participating issuer defendant could be required to contribute to the costs of the settlement if that issuer s insurance coverage were insufficient to pay that issuer s allocable share of the settlement costs 
we expect that our insurance proceeds will be sufficient for these purposes and that we will not otherwise be required to contribute to the proposed settlement 
consummation of the proposed settlement is conditioned upon  among other things  negotiating  executing  and 
table of contents filing with the court final settlement documents  and final approval by the court 
if the proposed settlement described above is not consummated  we intend to continue to defend the litigation vigorously 
moreover  if the proposed settlement is not consummated  we believe that the underwriters may have an obligation to indemnify us for the legal fees and other costs of defending this suit and that our directors and officers liability insurance policies would also cover the defense and potential exposure in the suit 
while we cannot guarantee the outcome of these proceedings  we believe that the final result of these actions will have no material effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview we are a leading provider of high quality software solutions and it services in china  helping our customers increase their business value in fast growing and evolving markets 
in the telecommunications market  our software and services enable our customers to build  maintain  operate  manage and continuously improve their communications infrastructure 
our largest customers are the major telecommunications carriers in china and their provincial subsidiaries 
in addition to providing software and customer solutions to china s telecom carriers  we also offer a wide range of enterprise solutions to small  medium and large sized chinese enterprises  across multiple vertical industries 
we commenced our operations in the united states in and moved our major operations from the united states to china in we began generating significant network solutions revenues in and significant software revenues in we conduct the bulk of our business through our operating subsidiaries  most of which are chinese companies 
we have derived  and believe that we will continue to derive  a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of large telecommunications customers  such as china mobile  china unicom  china telecom and china netcom group 
sales to china mobile and its subsidiaries amounted to approximately  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
sales to china netcom group and its subsidiaries amounted to approximately  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
sales to china unicom and its subsidiaries amounted to approximately  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
sales to china telecom and its subsidiaries amounted to approximately  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the sum of our top five receivable balances represented and of the total receivable balances for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we expanded our customer base in through the acquisition of an hrm and business intelligence software business with customers in sectors such as transportation and energy  and with our acquisition of lenovo s it services business 
however  our operating results are still dependent on our large customers in the telecommunications sector  and the loss of any of those customers could have a material adverse impact on us 

table of contents as a result of our reliance on our key customers in the telecommunications industry  our operating results are influenced by governmental spending policies in that sector 
historically  a number of state mandated restructurings in china s telecommunications sector have led to cancellation or delays in telecommunications related capital expenditure  and have negatively impacted our operating results in certain periods 
ongoing uncertainty in the telecommunication industry  combined with the chinese government s measures to control the over heating of the chinese economy  has contributed and may continue to contribute to cautious spending by our telecommunications customers 
in addition  any future restructurings affecting our major telecommunications customers may result in delays or cancellation of telecommunications related spending  which would likely have an adverse impact on our business 
on july   we signed a definitive agreement with lenovo group limited to acquire its non telecommunications related information technology services business in a transaction valued at approximately million  excluding transaction costs 
on october   we completed the closing of this acquisition and formed a new division  lenovo asiainfo  under which we operate the acquired assets  along with our other enterprise information solutions assets 
we believe this acquisition will greatly expand our current enterprise offerings and will allow us to provide security products and services  management consulting  as well as industry specific and hrm solutions to chinese enterprises in industries beyond our traditional telecommunications customer base 
we also anticipate that this acquisition will create significant cross selling opportunities for our products and services across a range of vertical industries  including manufacturing  financial services and the government sector 
in the fourth quarter of  the new lenovo asiainfo division generated approximately million in revenues  representing more than of our total revenues for the quarter 
revenues we report our revenues on the basis of the three principal types of revenues derived from our business software products and solutions revenue  service revenue and third party hardware revenue 
software products and solutions revenue 
we typically sell our software as part of total solutions for our customers  which include proprietary software licenses  professional services related to the design and implementation of the solution such as consulting  training  technical support and maintenance and  in cases where the customer requests a turn key solution  related hardware 
we do not sell any software products without these related implementation services 
software products and solutions revenue include two types of revenues software license revenue and software services revenue 
software license revenue consists of fees received from customers for licenses or sublicenses to use our software products or third party software products in perpetuity  typically up to a specified maximum number of users 
in most cases where a customer is required to purchase additional licenses from us because the number of users exceeds the number of licensed users  we enter into an extension agreement with the customer to expand and upgrade the customer s system 
these extension contracts will usually include a license for the additional users  an updated versions of our software and  if required  additional services and hardware for the customer s network 
our software license revenue also includes the benefit of value added tax rebates on software license sales  which are part of the chinese government s policy of encouraging china s software industry 
software services revenue consists of revenue from software installation  customization  training and other services 
service revenue 
service revenue consists of revenue from professional services  including it services  management consulting  and revenues for network planning  design  systems integration and training 
third party hardware revenue 
third party hardware revenue consists of hardware sales for equipment procured by us on behalf of our customers from hardware vendors 
we procure for and sell hardware to our customers as part of our total solutions strategy 
we typically minimize our exposure to hardware risks by sourcing equipment from hardware vendors against letters of credit from our customers 
as the telecommunications related it services market in china develops our customers are increasingly purchasing hardware directly from hardware vendors and hiring us for our professional services 

table of contents net revenue 
although we report our revenue on a gross basis  inclusive of hardware acquisition costs  we manage our business internally based on revenues net of hardware costs  or net revenues  which is consistent with our strategy of providing our customers with high value it professional services and  where efficient  outsourcing lower end services such as hardware acquisition and installation 
this strategy may result in lower growth rates for total revenue as against prior periods  but will not adversely impact revenue net of hardware costs 
the following table shows our revenue breakdown on this basis and reconciles our net revenues to our total revenues years ended december  amount in thousands of us software products and solutions revenue service revenue hardware revenue net of hardware costs total revenues net of hardware costs total hardware costs total revenues the information on revenues net of hardware costs  or net revenues  in the above table is a non gaap financial measure within the meaning of item of regulation s k under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
we have provided a reconciliation of this non gaap financial measure to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  total revenues 
we believe that the presentation of this non gaap measure provides useful information for investors regarding our regular financial performance because total revenues net of hardware costs more accurately reflect the core of our business  which is the provision of software solutions and services 
we believe such measure provides transparency to our investors because it is the measure used by our management to evaluate the competitiveness and development of our business 
in addition  third party hardware revenue tends to fluctuate from period to period depending on the requirements of our customers 
as a result  a presentation that excludes hardware costs allows investors to better evaluate the performance of our core business 
we have evaluated the criteria outlined in eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as principal versus net as an agent  in determining whether it is appropriate under gaap to record the gross amount of revenues and related costs or the net amount earned after deducting hardware costs paid to the supplier 
we record the gross amounts billed to our customers because we are the primary obligor in these transactions  bear the inventory risk  have latitude in establishing prices  are involved in the determination of the product specifications  bear credit risk and have the right to select suppliers 
the presentation above of additional information on revenues net of hardware costs is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with gaap 
cost of revenues software products and solutions costs 
software products and solutions costs consist primarily of three components packaging and written manual expenses for our proprietary software products and solutions  compensation and travel expenses for the professionals involved in modifying  customizing or installing our software products and solutions and in providing consultation  training and support services  and software license fees paid to third party software providers for the right to sublicense their products to our customers as part of our solutions offerings 

table of contents the costs associated with designing and modifying our proprietary software are classified as research and development expenses as incurred 
service costs 
service costs consist primarily of compensation and travel expenses for the professionals involved in designing and implementing it services  management consulting and network solutions projects 
service costs also include hardware warranty costs 
we accrue hardware warranty costs upon final acceptance 
we typically obtain manufacturers warranties for hardware we sell  which cover a portion of the warranties that we give to our customers 
we currently accrue of hardware sales to cover potential warranty expenses 
this estimate of warranty cost is based on our current experience with contracts for which the warranty period has expired 
third party hardware costs 
we recognize hardware costs in full upon delivery of the hardware to our customers 
in order to minimize our working capital requirements  we generally obtain from our hardware vendors payment terms that are timed to permit us to receive payment from our customers for the hardware before our payments to hardware vendors are due 
however  in large projects we sometimes obtain less favorable payment terms from our customers  thereby increasing our working capital requirements 
operating expenses operating expenses are comprised of sales and marketing expenses  research and development expenses  general and administrative expenses  and amortization expenses for intangible assets  deferred stock compensation and impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
compensation expenses consistently comprise a significant portion of our total operating expenses 
sales and marketing expenses include compensation expenses for employees in our sales and marketing departments  third party advertising expenses  as well as sales commissions and sales agency fees 
research and development expenses relate to the development of new software and the modification of existing software 
we expense such costs as they are incurred 
taxes except for certain hardware procurement and resale transactions  we conduct substantially all of our business through our chinese subsidiaries  which are generally subject to a state corporate income tax and a local income tax 
under the income tax laws of china  foreign invested enterprises  or fies  satisfying certain criteria can enjoy preferential tax treatment 
several of our operating subsidiaries are fies and enjoy certain preferential tax treatments in china 
please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for details of the preferential treatments for these subsidiaries 
the unified chinese corporate income tax laws for domestic enterprises and fies will likely take effect in we anticipate that these unified tax laws will eliminate various preferential tax provisions in china 
however  such unified tax laws should not affect the preferential tax treatments granted to fies in previous years 
sales of hardware procured in china are subject to a value added tax 
most of our sales of hardware procured outside of china are made through our us parent company  asiainfo holdings  inc  and thus are not subject to the value added tax 
we effectively pass value added taxes on hardware sales through to our customers and do not include them in revenues reported in our financial statements 
companies that develop their own software and register the software with the relevant authorities in china are generally entitled to a value added tax refund 
if the net amount of the value added tax payable exceeds of software sales and software related services  the excess portion of the value added tax is refundable immediately 
this policy is effective until 
table of contents we are also subject to us income taxes on revenues generated in the united states  including revenues from our limited hardware procurement activities through our us parent company  asiainfo holdings  inc  and interest income earned in the united states 
foreign exchange a majority of our revenues and expenses relating to hardware sales are denominated in us dollars  and substantially all of our revenues and expenses relating to the software and service components of our business are denominated in renminbi 
the value of our shares will be affected by the foreign exchange rate between us dollars and renminbi because the value of our business is effectively denominated in renminbi  while our shares are traded in us dollars 
furthermore  an increase in the value of the renminbi may require us to exchange more us dollars into renminbi to meet the working capital requirements of our subsidiaries in china 
depreciation of the value of the us dollar will also reduce the value of the cash we hold in us dollars  which we may use for purposes of future acquisitions or other business expansion 
we actively monitor our exposure to these risks and adjust our cash position in the renminbi and the us dollar when we believe such adjustments will reduce our foreign exchange risks 
for example  in february we exchanged approximately million cash from us dollars to renminbi in order to address concerns regarding a possible increase in the relative value of the renminbi 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenues and cost of revenues under customer contracts  warranty obligations  bad debts  income taxes  investment in affiliate  goodwill and other intangible assets  and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we generally charge a fixed price for all of our projects and recognize revenue based on the percentage of completion of the project as required under statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
with respect to software products and solutions  revenue from customer orders requiring significant production  modifications  or customizations of the software are recognized over the installation and customization period 
labor costs and direct project expenses are used to determine the stage of completion 
costs related to insignificant obligations for a period of up to one year  which include telephone support  are accrued at the time the revenue is recorded 
in cases where the customer requires additional software licenses  we typically enter into an extension agreement with the customer to expand and upgrade the customer s system 
revenue arising from such extension agreements is also recognized under sop we recognize service revenue which is charged on a fixed price basis based on the percentage of completion of the project as required under sop we use labor costs and direct project expenses to determine the state of completion 
we recognize third party hardware revenue upon delivery of the hardware to the customer 
since a large part of the cost of certain projects often relates to hardware  the timing of hardware delivery can cause our quarterly gross revenue and inventory level to fluctuate significantly 
however  those fluctuations do not significantly affect our gross profits because third party hardware revenue generally approximates the costs of the hardware 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to adjustments in current periods as the contract progresses to completion 
if we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress toward completion  revenue will be 
table of contents recognized upon completion 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each element of a transaction based upon its fair value as determined by vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
revenue is deferred for the fair value of any undelivered elements and recognized for the remainder of the arrangement fee attributable to the delivered elements when the basic criteria in statement of position no 
software revenue recognition sop have been met 
revenue in excess of billings is recorded as unbilled receivables and amounts billed but not yet collected are recorded as billed receivables 
billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenue 
provisions for estimated losses on contracts are made in the period in which the anticipated losses become known 
actual costs and gross margins on such contracts could differ from management s estimates and those differences could be material to the consolidated financial statements 
historically  our estimates for costs and gross margins have not differed significantly from actual costs and gross margins 
however  any material deviation of such costs and gross margins from our estimates would impact our future operating results 
income taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
goodwill 
beginning in  with the adoption of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is no longer amortized  but instead tested for impairment upon first adoption and annually thereafter  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired 
we use a two step impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and recognize a goodwill impairment loss in the statement of operations when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
prior to  goodwill was amortized using a straight line method over its economic life of five years 
accumulated amortization recorded through december  was  goodwill impairment tests were performed in the first and second quarters of for our acquisitions of bonson information technology holdings  ltd  and zhejiang asiainfo dekang telecommunications technology  inc  respectively 
we perform all goodwill impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year 
the latest goodwill impairment tests were performed in the fourth quarter of and no impairment losses were recognized 
we periodically evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists 
consolidated results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
total revenues  including hardware costs  decreased to million in  from million in revenues net of hardware costs increased approximately to million in software revenue was million  representing a increase from million in service revenue was million  representing a decrease from million in the decrease in our total revenues and the increase in our net revenues were primarily attributable to a reduction in hardware costs in favor of our higher margin software business 
the increase in software revenues was partially attributable to our acquisition of lenovo s it services business  which contributed million to software revenues in the fourth quarter 
the increase in software revenues was also driven by a growth in demand for our bss oss related software products and solutions  which represented of our total revenue net of hardware costs for the year 
cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues was million in  representing a decrease from million in  primarily due to decreased hardware orders partially offset by increased cost of software and services to meet increased demand 

table of contents gross profit 
gross profit increased in to million 
gross profit as a percentage of gross revenues  or gross margin  increased to in  as compared to in the increase in gross margin was attributable to the favorable shift out of hardware sales  the growth in software revenue  and the resulting increase in the contribution of software revenue to total revenue 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased to in  as compared to in operating expenses 
total operating expenses decreased to million in  from million in our relatively lower overall operating expenses in resulted primarily because of the million charge we recognized in for goodwill impairment 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in  from million in this increase was partially attributable to sales and marketing expenses of million from our lenovo asiainfo division 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in  from million in  partially as a result of a decrease in bad debt expenses 
research and development expenses remained relatively flat at million in  as compared to million in gain from disposal of investment 
in the third quarter of  we received a distribution consisting of cash and shares of linktone ltd 
nasdaq lton from intrinsic technology holdings  ltd  or intrinsic  in which we held a minority interest 
the distribution resulted in an investment gain of million for the third quarter of because the distribution exceeded the carrying value of our investment in intrinsic  which had been written down to million by december  net income loss 
our net income was million in  or per share on a fully diluted basis  as compared to a net loss of million in  or a loss of per share on a fully diluted basis 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
total revenues  including hardware pass through  decreased to million in  from million in revenues net of hardware costs decreased approximately to million in software revenue was million  representing a decrease from million in the decrease in our total revenues was primarily attributable to the business slowdown caused by the sars outbreak in  as well as our continued focus on providing software solutions which effectively reduces our revenues from hardware pass through 
cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues was million in  remaining at approximately the same level as due to the fixed nature of our compensation expenses 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased in to million 
gross profit as a percentage of gross revenues  or gross margin  decreased to in  as compared to in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased to in  as compared to in these decreases in margins were primarily attributable to the fixed nature of our compensation expenses  which form a significant aspect of our costs of revenues 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses increased to million in  from million in  primarily as a result of our recording the goodwill impairment charges discussed below 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in  from million in this decrease was partially attributable to our consolidation of sales operations and our increased sales efficiency as a result of 
table of contents our operational restructuring  effective july   which focused our business operation on specific customers rather than product lines 
instead of selling our products and services through our two former strategic business units  communications solutions and operation support systems solutions  we developed one point of sales contact for each of our major customers  streamlining our relationships and interactions with our customers 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in  from million in  largely as a result of increased bad debt expenses in the amount of million 
research and development expenses increased to million in  from million in  due to our continued focus on developing new software products and solutions for china s telecommunications carriers 
in  we conducted impairment tests regarding the goodwill recorded in our acquisition of bonson in based on those tests  we recorded approximately million in impairment charges 
equity in loss of affiliates 
equity in loss of affiliate in of approximately million represented an impairment charge related to our investment in  as well as our proportionate share of losses incurred by  intrinsic  in which we held a minority stake 
we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million in connection with our investment in intrinsic based on an impairment test conducted in the fourth quarter of net income loss 
our net loss was million in  or a loss of per share on a fully diluted basis  as compared to net income of million in  or income of per share on a fully diluted basis 
the impairment charges from our acquisition of bonson and our investment in intrinsic  described above  reduced our earnings in by per share

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements are primarily working capital requirements related to hardware sales and costs associated with the expansion of our business  such as research and development and sales and marketing expenses 
we recognize hardware costs in full upon delivery of the hardware to our customers 
in order to minimize our working capital requirements  we generally obtain from our hardware vendors payment terms that are timed to permit us to receive payment from our customers for the hardware before our payments to hardware vendors are due 
however  we sometimes obtain less favorable payment terms from our customers  thereby increasing our working capital requirements 
we have historically financed our working capital and other financing requirements through careful management of our billing cycle  private placements of equity securities  our initial public offering in march of and  to a limited extent  bank loans 
our net operating cash flow was million in  increasing our cash position including cash  restricted cash and short term investments to million as of december   as compared to million as of december  our net cash flow was enhanced by significant accounts receivable collection towards the end of our accounts receivable balance at december  was million  consisting of million in billed receivables and million in unbilled receivables 
this balance included more than million in accounts receivable acquired from lenovo in our purchase of its it services business 
our billed receivables are based on revenue we have booked and billed 
our unbilled receivables are based on revenue we have booked through the percentage completion method  but for which we have not yet billed the customer 
for example  we recognize revenues for hardware pass through at the time the hardware is accepted by the customer  based on the cost of the underlying hardware 
however  our contracts with our customers will often allow the customers to withhold of the total contract payments until final project acceptance  which on average is eight to nine months after hardware delivery 
as a result  revenues from hardware pass through generally represent a significant portion of our unbilled receivables and can cause the aging of these receivables to be relatively long 
at december   our days sales outstanding were days  as compared to days at the end of the third quarter of as a result of higher gross revenues and lower accounts receivable during the quarter 
our inventory position at the end of was approximately million  up as compared to the beginning of the year 
this increase was attributable our having million in network equipment in the process of delivery to customers for two larger projects  as well as our having acquired approximately million in inventory in connection with lenovo s it services business 
as of december   we had total short term credit facilities for working capital purposes totaling million  expiring by december  which were secured by bank deposits of million 
million of the short term credit facilities were used to issue letters of credit and notes payable at that date 
additional bank deposits of million were used for issuing standby letters of credit and bank acceptance drafts 
bank deposits pledged as security for these standby letters of credit  bank acceptance drafts and short term credit facilities totaled million as of december   and are presented as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   we were committed under certain operating leases  requiring annual minimum rentals of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that the net proceeds of our initial public offering in march  together with available funds and cash flows generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital  capital expenditures and business expansion through we may need to raise additional funds in the future  however  in order to fund acquisitions  develop new or enhanced services or products  respond to competitive pressures to compete successfully for larger projects involving higher levels of hardware purchases  or if our business otherwise grows more rapidly than we currently predict 
we anticipate that we would raise additional funds  if necessary  through new issuances of shares of our equity securities in one or more public offerings or private placements  or through credit facilities extended by lending institutions 

table of contents in the event that we decide to pay dividends to our shareholders  our ability to pay dividends will depend in part on our ability to receive dividends from our operating subsidiaries in china 
foreign exchange and other regulations in china may restrict our ability to distribute retained earnings from our operating subsidiaries in china or convert those payments from renminbi into foreign currencies 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements with any individuals or entities

table of contents certain risks that may affect our operating results and our common stock in addition to the other information in this report  the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business and our future prospects the growth of our business is dependent on government telecommunications infrastructure and budgetary policies  particularly the allocation of funds to sustain the growth of the telecommunications industry in china 
most of our large telecommunications customers are directly or indirectly owned or controlled by the government of china 
accordingly  their business strategies  capital expenditure budgets and spending plans are largely decided in accordance with government policies  which  in turn  are determined on a centralized basis at the highest level by the national development and reform commission of china 
as a result  the growth of our business is heavily dependent on government policies for telecommunications infrastructure 
insufficient government allocation of funds to sustain the growth of china s telecommunications industries in the future could reduce the demand for our products and services and have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business 
historically  china s telecommunications sector has been subject to a number of state mandated restructurings 
for example  in china telecom was split geographically into a northern division comprising ten provinces and a southern division comprising provinces 
under the restructuring  the northern division of china telecom merged with china netcom and was renamed china network communications group corporation  or china netcom group  while the southern division continued to use the china telecom name 
as a result of the restructuring  new orders for telecommunications infrastructure expansion and improvement projects decreased  adversely affecting our net revenue 
any similar restructurings of this nature could cause our operating results to vary unexpectedly from quarter to quarter in the future 
our customer base is concentrated and the loss of one or more of our customers could cause our business to suffer significantly 
we have derived  and believe that we will continue to derive  a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of large customers in the telecommunications industry  such as china mobile  china unicom  china telecom and china netcom group 
china mobile accounted for of our revenues in the loss  cancellation or deferral of any large contract by any of our large customers would have a material adverse effect on our revenues  and consequently our profits 
our acquisition of the human resources management and business intelligence software business of pacific software in early  as well as our recent acquisition of lenovo s it services business  are part of our strategy to further diversify our business and gradually reduce such concentration risk in the future 
however  in the near term  the expected revenue to be generated by our business outside the telecommunications industry is still limited compared to our overall revenues 
moreover  we cannot provide any assurance that a material proportion of our revenues will be derived from other industries in the future 
the long and variable sales cycles for our products and services can cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from period to period and may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
our revenues and operating results will vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 
a customer s decision to purchase our services and products involves a significant commitment of its resources and an extended evaluation 
as a result  our sales cycle tends to be lengthy 
we spend considerable time and expense educating and providing information to prospective customers about features and applications of our services and products 
because our major customers often operate large and complex networks  they usually expand their networks in large increments on a sporadic basis 
the combination of these factors can cause our revenues and results of operations to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter 

table of contents a large part of the contract amount of our projects often relates to hardware procurement 
since we recognize most of the revenues relating to hardware plus a portion of services and software revenues at the time of hardware delivery  the timing of hardware delivery can cause our quarterly gross revenues to fluctuate significantly 
due to the foregoing factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance and should not be overly relied upon 
it is likely that our operating results in some periods may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in this event  the price of our common stock will probably decline  perhaps significantly more in percentage terms than any corresponding decline in our operating results 
our working capital requirements may increase significantly 
we typically purchase hardware for our customers as part of our turn key total solutions services 
we generally require our customers to pay to of the invoice value of the hardware upon delivery 
we typically place orders for hardware against back to back orders from customers and seek favorable payment terms from hardware vendors 
this policy has historically minimized our working capital requirements 
however  for certain large and strategically important projects  we have agreed to payment of less than to of the invoice value of the hardware upon delivery in order to maintain competitiveness 
wider adoption of less favorable payment terms or delays in hardware deliveries could cause our working capital needs to increase significantly 
we have sustained losses in prior years and may incur slower earnings growth  earnings declines or net losses in the future 
although we had net income in  and  we sustained net losses in and there are no assurances that we can sustain profitability or avoid net losses in the future 
we continue to expect that certain of our operating expenses will increase as our business grows 
the level of these expenses will be largely based on anticipated organizational growth and revenue trends and a high percentage  particularly compensation expenses  will be fixed 
as a result  any delays in expanding sales volume and generating revenue could result in substantial operating losses 
our high level of fixed costs  as well as increased competition in the software market  could result in reduced operating margins 
we maintain a relatively stable work force of software and network engineers engaged in all phases of planning and executing projects on behalf of our customers 
as a result  our operating costs are relatively fixed from quarter to quarter  regardless of fluctuations in our revenues 
in recent periods  this has resulted in our gross profit decreasing as a percentage of our net revenues 
for example  during the second quarter of our revenues were impacted by the outbreak of sars and our gross profit as a percentage of net revenue decreased to as compared to in the comparable period of future fluctuations in our net revenues could result in similar decreases in our operating margins 
in addition  enhanced competition in the software market and other markets in which we operate could result in reduced prices  which  together with our relatively fixed operating costs  could also result in reduced operating margins 
business acquisitions we undertake may be challenging  and we may realize losses on our investments 
on october   we completed our acquisition of the it services business of lenovo group limited and formed a new division  lenovo asiainfo  comprised primarily of the acquired assets and our existing enterprise it services business 
in the future  we may acquire other companies or assets that we feel will enhance our revenue growth  operations and profitability 
such acquisitions could result in the use of significant amounts of cash and dilutive issuances of our common stock 
such acquisitions involve other significant risks  including the difficulties of integrating  assimilating and managing the operations  technologies  intellectual property  products and personnel of the acquired business  the diversion of management attention from other business concerns  
table of contents the additional expense associated with acquired contingent liabilities  the loss of key employees in acquired businesses  and the risk of being sued by terminated employees and contractors 
we will need to integrate and manage any businesses we determine to acquire in the future 
our failure to do so successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
prc laws and regulations currently prohibit foreign invested companies from engaging in systems integration businesses involving state secrets  which is part of the it services business we acquired from lenovo in prc laws and regulations also restrict certain foreign invested companies from participating in the vats business  which we are exploring the possibility of entering 
substantial uncertainties exist with respect to our contractual arrangements with lenovo computer  lenovo security and star vats  due to uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future prc laws and regulations 
in  the state secrecy bureau of china promulgated the administrative measures for qualification of computer information systems integration involving state secrets  which expressly prohibits foreign persons or foreign invested enterprises from engaging in systems integration businesses involving state secrets  or restricted businesses 
state secrets as defined under the commercial encryption administrative regulation  include all code technology and code products used in encryption and security authentication  irrespective of whether such information belongs to the state 
we and our prc operating subsidiaries are considered foreign persons or foreign invested enterprises under prc laws 
in addition to a number of other types of it services  one of the businesses operated by the it services division we acquired from lenovo in was a restricted business 
as a result  we operate the restricted business through affiliated entities in which we do not hold a direct equity interest 
we currently operate the restricted business through lenovo computer  and  upon the receipt by lenovo security of certain business licenses and qualifications  we intend to operate the restricted business through lenovo security 
lenovo computer is owned by certain subsidiaries of lenovo 
lenovo security is owned by legend holdings limited  the parent company and controlling shareholder of lenovo  and certain of our employees who are prc citizens 
lenovo computer currently conducts substantially all of our operations in relation to the restricted business  generates substantially all of our revenue relating to such business  and makes use of the licenses and approvals that are essential to such business 
we do not currently have any equity interest in lenovo computer or lenovo security and instead enjoy economic benefits substantially similar to equity ownership in such companies through contractual arrangements between lenovo asiainfo technologies  inc  or lenovo asiainfo  our wholly owned subsidiary  and these affiliated entities and their respective shareholders 
further information on these arrangements is set forth under the heading certain relationships and related transactions in the definitive proxy statement for our annual meeting of shareholders  filed with the securities and exchange commission on or about the date of this report 
in the opinion of our chinese legal counsel  t c law office  and chinese legal counsel to lenovo group  tian yuan law firm  our current ownership structure of lenovo computer and lenovo security  and the contractual arrangements among us  lenovo asiainfo  these affiliated entities and their respective shareholders  are in compliance with all existing prc laws and regulations 
there are  however  substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current or future prc laws and regulations  including regulations governing the validity and enforcement of such contractual arrangements 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that prc government authorities will not ultimately take a view contrary to the opinion of our and lenovo s chinese counsels 
if the prc government finds that our contractual arrangements with lenovo computer and lenovo security do not comply with its prohibition on foreign invested companies from engaging in systems integration businesses involving state secrets  we could be subject to severe penalties 
in june of we entered into similar contractual arrangements with star vats  a domestic company owned by certain of our employees who are prc citizens  which has been established to engage in the vats business 
table of contents in china 
star vats is in the process of developing vats products and services that we hope to offer in china 
we anticipate that if we successfully launch our vats products and services  all of our business related to such products and services will be conducted through star vats 
star vats will generate any revenue relating to such business and will make use of the licenses and approvals that are essential to such business 
we do not have any equity interest in star vats  but instead have the right to enjoy economic benefits similar to equity ownership through our contractual arrangements with star vats and its shareholders 
in the opinion of our chinese legal counsel  t c law firm  the contractual arrangements among us  star vats  and the shareholders of star vats are in compliance with all existing prc laws and regulations 
there are  however  substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future prc laws and regulations  including regulations governing the validity and enforcement of such contractual arrangements 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that prc government authorities will not ultimately take a view contrary to the opinion of our chinese legal counsel 
if the prc government finds that our contractual arrangements with star vats do not comply with its restrictions on certain foreign invested companies from engaging in vats businesses  we could be subject to severe penalties 
our contractual arrangements with lenovo computer  lenovo security and star vats may not be as effective in providing operational control as direct ownership of these affiliated entities and may be difficult to enforce 
although we have been advised by chinese legal counsel that our contractual arrangements with lenovo computer lenovo security and star vats are valid  binding and enforceable under current prc laws  these arrangements may not be as effective in providing control as direct ownership of these affiliated entities 
for example  these affiliated entities and their respective shareholders could fail to perform or make payments as required under such contractual arrangements 
in any such event  we would have to rely on the prc legal system to enforce these agreements 
any legal proceedings could result in the disruption of our business  damage to our reputation  diversion of our resources and the incurrence of substantial costs 
we may not be able to operate the systems integration businesses involving state secrets once we acquire all of the equity interest in lenovo computer and lenovo security 
prc laws and regulations currently prohibit foreign persons or foreign invested enterprises from engaging in systems integration businesses involving state secrets 
we and our subsidiaries are considered foreign persons or foreign invested enterprises under prc laws 
unless such prohibition is lifted in the future  we will not be able to operate such business after we acquire all of the equity interest in lenovo computer and lenovo security pursuant to the terms of our contractual arrangements with lenovo computer and lenovo security and their respective shareholders 
the loss of this line of business may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
asset impairment reviews may result in future periodic write downs 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 which requires us  among other things  to review goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually 
in connection with our business acquisitions  we make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets 
in assessing the related useful lives of those assets  we have to make assumptions regarding their fair value  our recoverability of those assets and our ability to successfully develop and ultimately commercialize acquired technology 
if those assumptions change in the future when we conduct our periodic reviews in accordance with applicable accounting standards  we may be required to record impairment charges 
we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million as a result of an independent valuation during the first quarter of of the goodwill and acquired intangible assets mainly attributable to our acquisition of bonson in february in december we recorded an impairment charge of million related to our investment in intrinsic 
there is no assurance that future reviews will not result in further write downs to goodwill and other intangible assets 

table of contents severe acute respiratory syndrome may have an impact on our business 
the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  is believed to have started in guangdong province  china in late and to have later spread to beijing 
the sars outbreak impacted our revenues in by disrupting travel throughout china and causing serious delays in service delivery to our customers 
the outbreak also interrupted our collection efforts  causing accounts receivable and days sales outstanding to increase 
although the spread of sars in china appears to have been contained and our business activities resumed normal operations throughout the third and fourth quarters of  the medical community worldwide has not fully understood the origin of sars and has not found a well recognized effective treatment for sars 
as a consequence  the potential long term effects of sars on economic growth in china are still unknown 
any re emergence or worsening of the sars epidemic could have an adverse impact on our business 
we are highly dependent on our executive officers 
each of our executive officers is responsible for an important segment of our operations 
although we believe that we have significant depth at all levels of management  the loss of any of our executive officers services could be detrimental to our operations 
we do not have  and do not plan to obtain  key man life insurance on any of our employees 
we face a competitive labor market in china for skilled personnel and therefore are highly dependent on the skills and services of our existing key skilled personnel and our ability to hire additional skilled employees 
competition for highly skilled software design  engineering and sales and marketing personnel is intense in china 
our failure to attract  assimilate or retain qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs could impair our growth 
competition for skilled personnel comes primarily from a wide range of foreign companies active in china  many of which have substantially greater resources than we have 
limitations on our ability to hire and train a sufficient number of personnel at all levels would limit our ability to undertake projects in the future and could cause us to lose market share 
we extend warranties to our customers that expose us to potential liabilities 
we customarily provide our customers with one to three year warranties  under which we agree to maintain installed systems at no additional cost to our customers 
the maintenance services cover both hardware and our proprietary and third party software products 
although we seek to arrange back to back warranties with hardware and software vendors  we have the primary responsibility to maintain the installed hardware and software 
our contracts often do not have disclaimers or limitations on liability for special  consequential and incidental damages  nor do we typically cap the amounts our customers can recover for damages 
in addition  we do not currently maintain any insurance policy with respect to our exposure to warranty claims 
the failure of our installed projects to operate properly could give rise to substantial liability for special  consequential or incidental damages  which in turn could materially and adversely affect us 
we sell our services on a fixed price  fixed time basis  which exposes us to risks associated with cost overruns and delays 
we sell most of our services on a fixed price  fixed time basis 
in contracts with our customers  we typically agree to pay late completion fines of up to of the total contract value 
in large scale telecommunications infrastructure projects  there are many factors beyond our control which could cause delays or cost overruns 
in this event  we would be exposed to cost overruns and liable for late completion fines 
we may become less competitive if we are unable to develop or acquire new products  or enhancements to our existing products  that are marketable on a timely and cost effective basis 
our future operating results will depend  to a significant extent  upon our ability to enhance our existing products and services and to introduce new products and services to meet the requirements of our customers in a rapidly developing and evolving market 
if we do not enhance our existing products and services or introduce new 
table of contents successful products and services in a timely manner  our products and services may become obsolete  and our revenues and operating results may suffer 
moreover  unexpected technical  operational  distribution or other problems could delay or prevent the introduction of any products or services that we may plan to introduce in the future 
we cannot be sure that any of these products and services will achieve widespread market acceptance or generate incremental revenues 
our proprietary rights may be inadequately protected and there is a risk of poor enforcement of intellectual property rights in china 
our success and ability to compete depend substantially upon our intellectual property rights  which we protect through a combination of confidentiality arrangements and copyright  trademark  and patent registrations 
we have registered some marks and filed trademark applications for other marks with the united states patent and trademark office  the trademark bureau of the state administration of industry and commerce in china and the trade marks registry in hong kong 
we have also registered copyrights with the state copyright bureau in china with respect to certain of our software products  although we have not applied for copyright protection elsewhere including the united states 
we have filed some patent applications and have acquired some existing patents in the prc for certain hardware and software products used or developed in our business 
despite these precautions  the legal regime protecting intellectual property rights in china is weak 
moreover  bonson information technology holdings  ltd  which we acquired in february  had never registered copyrights for its software products prior to the acquisition 
because the chinese legal system in general  and the intellectual property regime in particular  are relatively weak  it is often difficult to enforce intellectual property rights in china 
in addition  there are other countries where effective copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with most of our employees and consultants  and control access to  and distribution of  our documentation and other licensed information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our licensed services or technology without authorization  or to develop similar technology independently 
policing unauthorized use of our licensed technology is difficult and there can be no assurance that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation or infringement of our proprietary technology 
in addition  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources 
a portion of our business involves the development and customization of software applications for customers 
we generally retain significant ownership or rights to use and market such software for other customer projects  where possible 
however  our customers sometimes retain co ownership and rights to use the applications  processes  and intellectual property so developed 
in some cases  we may have no right or only limited rights to reuse or provide these developments in projects involving other customers 
to the extent that we are unable to negotiate contracts which permit us to reuse source codes and methodologies  or to the extent that we have conflicts with our customers regarding our ability to do so  we may be unable to provide similar solutions to our other customers 
we are exposed to certain business and litigation risks with respect to technology rights held by third parties 
we currently license technology from third parties and intend to do so increasingly in the future as we introduce services that require new technology 
there can be no assurance that these technology licenses will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
our inability to obtain any of these licenses could delay or compromise our ability to introduce new services 
in addition  we may or may allegedly breach the technology rights of others and incur legal expenses and damages  which could be substantial 

table of contents investors may not be able to enforce judgments by united states courts against certain of our officers and directors 
we are incorporated in the state of delaware 
however  a majority of our directors and executive officers  and certain of our principal shareholders  live outside of the united states  principally in beijing and hong kong 
as a result  you may not be able to effect service of process upon those persons within the united states  or enforce against those persons judgments obtained in united states courts  including judgments relating to the federal securities laws of the united states 
we do not intend to pay and may be restricted from paying dividends on our common stock 
we have never declared or paid dividends on our capital stock and we do not intend to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future 
we currently intend to retain future earnings to fund our growth 
furthermore  if we decide to pay dividends  foreign exchange and other regulations in china may restrict our ability to distribute retained earnings from china or convert those payments from renminbi into foreign currencies 
the fact that our business is conducted in both us dollars and renminbi may subject us to currency exchange rate risk due to fluctuations in the exchange rate between those two currencies 
substantially all of our revenues  expenses and liabilities are denominated in either us dollars or renminbi 
as a result  we are subject to the effects of exchange rate fluctuations between those currencies 
because of the unitary exchange rate system introduced in china on january   the official bank exchange rate for conversion of renminbi to us dollars experienced a devaluation of approximately 
we report our financial results in us dollars  therefore  any future devaluation of the renminbi against the us dollar may have an adverse effect on our reported net income 
substantially all our revenues and expenses relating to hardware sales are denominated in us dollars  and substantially all our revenues and expenses relating to the software and services component of our business are denominated in renminbi 
the value of our shares may be affected by the foreign exchange rate between the us dollar and the renminbi because the value of our business is effectively denominated in renminbi  while our shares are traded in us dollars 
furthermore  an increase in the value of the renminbi may require us to exchange more us dollars into renminbi to meet the working capital requirements of our subsidiaries in china 
depreciation of the value of the us dollar will also reduce the value of the cash we hold in us dollars  which we may use for purposes of future acquisitions or other business expansion 
the markets in which we sell our services and products are competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively 
our main domestic competitors in china include local systems integration and it services firms  including digital china  huawei  linkage and neusoft 
our international competitors include multinational companies such as ibm global services  hp services  oracle  sibel  convergys and sap  which are establishing more active presences in the it services market in china 
in addition  top international consulting companies such as pwc consulting recently acquired by ibm  deloitte consulting  capgemini  accenture  and bearing point  have also entered china s it services market 
our competitors  many of whom have greater financial  technical and human resources than we have  may be able to respond more quickly to new and emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of new products or services 
it is possible that competition in the form of new competitors or alliances  joint ventures or consolidation among existing competitors may decrease our market share 
increased competition could result in lower personnel utilization rates  billing rate reductions  fewer customer engagements  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any one of which could materially and adversely affect our profits and overall financial condition 

table of contents political and economic policies of the chinese government could affect our industry in general and our competitive position in particular 
since the establishment of the people s republic of china in  the communist party has been the governing political party in china 
the highest bodies of leadership are the politburo of the communist party  the central committee and the national people s congress 
the state council  which is the highest institution of government administration  reports to the national people s congress and has under its supervision various commissions  agencies and ministries  including the ministry of information industry  the telecommunications regulatory body of the chinese government 
since the late s  the chinese government has been reforming the chinese economic system 
although we believe that economic reform and the macroeconomic measures adopted by the chinese government have had and will continue to have a positive effect on economic development in china  there can be no assurance that the economic reform strategy will not from time to time be modified or revised 
such modifications or revisions  if any  could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of china 
such developments could reduce  perhaps significantly  the demand for our products and services 
furthermore  changes in political  economic and social conditions in china  adjustments in policies of the chinese government or changes in laws and regulations could adversely affect our industry in general and our competitive position in particular 
recently  the chinese government s increased measures to control economic growth have contributed and will continue to contribute to cautious spending by our telecommunications customers 
such measures may also result in the delay of certain large telecommunications related projects  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
high technology and emerging market shares have historically experienced extreme volatility and may subject you to losses 
the trading price of our shares may be subject to significant market volatility due to investor perceptions of investments relating to china and asia  as well as developments in the telecommunications industry 
in addition  the high technology sector of the stock market frequently experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of many software companies and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies 
if our stock price is volatile  we may become subject to securities litigation  which is expensive and could result in a diversion of resources 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
many companies in our industry have been subject to this type of litigation in the past  and we are currently involved in this type of litigation as a result of allegedly improper allocation procedures relating to the sale of our common stock in connection with our initial public offering in march of for more information on that litigation  please see the discussion under the heading item legal proceedings in part i of this report 
litigation is often expensive and diverts management s attention and resources  which could materially and adversely affect our business 
future sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options  the market price of our common stock could fall 
such sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
we are subject to anti takeover provisions that could prevent a change of control and prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium on their common stock 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of our preferred stock 
without any further vote or action on the part of our stockholders  the board of directors has the authority to determine the 
table of contents price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock 
this preferred stock  if it is ever issued  may have preference over and harm the rights of the holders of our common stock 
although the issuance of this preferred stock will provide us with flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  such an issuance may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
we currently have authorized the size of our board of directors to be not less than three nor more than ten directors 
the terms of the office of the ten member board of directors have been divided into three classes class i  whose term will expire at the annual meeting of the stockholders to be held in  class ii  whose term will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in  and class iii  whose term will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in this classification of the board of directors may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in our control or management 
we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
in general  the statute prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date when the person became an interested stockholder unless  subject to certain exceptions  the business combination or the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner 
generally  a business combination includes a merger  asset or stock sale  or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the stockholder  and an interested stockholder includes any person that is the owner of or more of our outstanding voting stock or is an affiliate or associate of ours 
our change of control severance agreements with executive officers may discourage a change of control 
we have entered into change of control severance agreements with most of our executive officers 
these agreements provide  among other things  that the executive officers would be entitled to various benefits upon the occurrence of either a covered termination as defined therein or a change of control as defined therein  including payment of one year of base salary and bonus  immediate vesting of of any outstanding unvested stock options held by the executive officer and provisions of medical benefits and housing allowance 
the potential obligations to pay the executive officers the above amounts may discourage a potential acquiror from effecting a change of control 
we are subject to potential liabilities and anticipate significant increases in expenses in complying with the sarbanes oxley act 
in july  president george w 
bush signed the sarbanes oxley act of into law 
among other things  the act imposes corporate governance  reporting  and disclosure requirements  introduces stricter independence and financial expertise standards for audit committees  and sets stiff penalties for securities fraud 
the act and the related rules and regulations have increased the scope  complexity and costs of our corporate governance  reporting  and disclosure practices  and may increase the risk of personal liability for our board members  chief executive officer  and chief financial officer 
any such liabilities may adversely affect our reputation  our business  or our ability to meet listing criteria 
section of the sarbanes oxley act requires our management and our independent auditors to assess our internal controls over financial reporting on an annual basis 
during the course of our assessment of our internal control environment throughout the year  we identified certain deficiencies that  if not remedied and re tested by december   would result in material weaknesses in our internal control environment 
as of december   we were able to successfully remediate and re test all previously identified potential material weaknesses in our internal control environment except for a weakness related to our provisioning for income tax under us gaap 
there is a risk that our inability to conclude that there were no material weaknesses in our internal financial reporting as of december  could negatively impact investor confidence and our stock price 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily associated with our cash  short term investments and short term bank loans 
to date  we have not entered into any types of derivatives to hedge against interest rate changes 
we are exposed to exchange rate risk in connection with the relative value of the us dollar and the renminbi 
substantially all of our revenues and expenses relating to hardware sales are denominated in us dollars  and substantially all of our revenues and expenses relating to the service and software components of our business are denominated in renminbi 
as of december   the rate of exchange for us dollars quoted by the people s bank of china was us rmb 
hypothetically  if the exchange rate were to increase by to us rmb  our net assets would increase by million 
likewise  if the exchange rate were to decrease by to us rmb  then our net assets would decrease by million 
the average exchange rate throughout and maintained at about to  fluctuating at only approximately 
to avoid currency risk related to the renminbi  we maintain significant portions of our cash deposits in both renminbi and us dollars 
a portion of our us dollar deposits are used to collateralize renminbi denominated loans from chinese banks 
the value of our shares will be affected by the foreign exchange rate between us dollars and renminbi because the value of our business is effectively denominated in renminbi  while our shares are traded in us dollars 
furthermore  an increase in the value of the renminbi may require us to exchange more us dollars into renminbi to meet the working capital requirements of our subsidiaries in china 
depreciation of the value of the us dollar will also reduce the value of the cash we hold in us dollars  which we may use for purposes of future acquisitions or business expansion 
we actively monitor our exposure to these risks and adjust our cash position in the renminbi and the us dollar when we believe such adjustments will reduce our foreign exchange risk 
for example  in february we exchanged approximately million cash into renminbi 
there have been no significant changes in our exposure to changes in either interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates for the year ended december  our exposure to interest rate changes is limited as we do not have variable rate or long term borrowings 
we are subject to variable interest rates on our bank deposits that are short term investments 
as there are no significant market price movements  such investments are held at cost 
as in any other business  we are subject to the risk of macroeconomic changes such as recessions and inflation
