some of our asip devices also integrate active analog elements to provide additional functionality 
we also offer selected active analog devices that complement our asip devices 
they include integrated led drivers and interface circuits for mobile handsets and power management devices for digital consumer electronics products 
our active analog device solutions use industry standard manufacturing processes for cost effectiveness 
within the past four years  we have streamlined our operations and become completely fabless using independent providers of wafer fabrication services 
we have focused our marketing and sales on strategic customers in our three core markets 
as a part of this process  we have reduced the number of our actively marketed products from approximately  to less than while at the same time increasing our unit volume shipments from less than million units in the quarter ended march  to million units in the quarter ended march  end customers for our semiconductor products are original equipment manufacturers oems including dell inc  hewlett packard company  kyocera wireless corp  lg electronics  motorola  inc  pantech co  ltd  samsung electronics co  ltd 
and sony corporation 
we sell to some of these end customers through original design manufacturers odms  including arima computer corporation  benq corporation  compal electronics  inc and quanta computer  inc  and contract electronics manufacturers cems  including foxconn hon hai precision industry co  ltd 
and solectron corporation 
we use a direct sales force  manufacturers representatives and a network of distributors to sell our semiconductor products 
we operate in one operating segment and most of our assets are located in the united states 
our assets located outside the united states are comprised primarily of product inventories and manufacturing equipment

fiscal versus net sales for fiscal were million  an increase of million or from the million of net sales in fiscal the increase in net sales to the mobile handset market was partially offset by declines in our other markets 
our increased sales resulted primarily from larger unit sales  due in part from increased sales of current products and in part from sales of newly introduced products 
our average unit price decreased by during fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was due to three factors a the faster growth in sales of our mobile handset products  which sell at lower prices than products for the other markets  b reductions in average selling prices of individual products  and c the decline in the portion of our sales from medical and other products which sold at relatively high prices 
our growth in mobile handset sales was primarily the result of increased penetration and secondarily the result of market growth 
the decline in personal computing and digital consumer sales was due to a decline in our older products 
the decline in medical was the result of lower demand from our principal customer  guidant  and our discontinuing these products during the fourth quarter of fiscal sales of our other products  which includes lighting  communications  legacy and mature products  also declined due to our having largely completed end of life shipments during fiscal fiscal unit shipments increased to approximately million units from approximately million units in fiscal fiscal versus net sales for fiscal were million  an increase of million or from the million in fiscal the largest component of the increase was in the mobile handset market followed by higher sales in the medical and personal computing and digital consumer electronics markets 
our increased net sales resulted primarily from larger unit sales  due in part from increased sales of current products and in part from sales of newly introduced products  and to a lesser extent  from price increases on our medical products 
our average unit price decreased by approximately in fiscal versus fiscal this average unit price decrease was 
table of contents 
index to financial statements predominately the result of faster growth in our lower priced products and reductions in average selling prices of individual products which offset our medical product price increases 
our growth in sales to the mobile handset market was primarily the result of increased penetration and secondarily the result of market growth 
during fiscal  we announced that we had design wins at and were shipping products to samsung electronics in addition to motorola and lg electronics  who are among the top tier of handset manufacturers 
in addition to these top tier manufacturers  we also sell our products to a large number of other handset manufacturers 
the growth in the medical business was primarily the result of improved pricing  and secondarily additional demand 
the growth in personal computing and digital consumer was primarily the result of increased shipments 
our sales from other products  which include lighting  communications  legacy and mature products  declined in fiscal versus fiscal we had expected the decrease in sales of our communications  legacy and mature products as we had previously provided our customers with end of life purchase opportunities for which we substantially completed shipment during fiscal in addition  price increases for our lighting products and other factors resulted in a significant reduction in orders for these products and we do not expect these products to be a significant contributor to our sales in the future

cost of sales fiscal versus cost of sales increased by million in fiscal to million 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales declined by basis points to in fiscal  from in the prior year 
the cost of sales changes were as follows 
table of contents 
index to financial statements cost of sales increase decrease  in millions mix change volume net reserve changes cost reductions the cost of sales increase related to product mix changes was primarily due to the increase in sales for mobile handsets while sales of our end of life and medical products declined 
in fiscal our non core products  which are comprised of other and medical  generated gross margins as a percentage of sales above the company s average gross margin as we maximized the return on these products that we were exiting 
the volume driven cost of sales increase was the result of higher mobile handset sales 
the change in net inventory reserves was due to a decline in the sales of previously reserved inventories 
total reserve provisions were unchanged from the prior year at million but the sale of previously reserved inventory declined from million to  in fiscal during fiscal there was limited or no demand for many of these products and as a result we scrapped substantial quantities of reserved inventory that we no longer expected to sell 
most of the products for which we establish inventory reserves are sold to customers with erratic and unpredictable demand 
as a result  we experienced sales of some products that were previously reserved and the requirement to further write down certain other products for which orders did not occur as we had expected 
additionally  there are often significant differences in time between when we reserve a product and when the demand arises 
we typically hold reserved inventory for a substantial period of time before determining that it is not likely to be sold at which point we physically scrap it 
most of the reserved inventory that we scrapped during fiscal had been reserved for several years 
product cost reductions were the result of lower subcontractor costs  cost reductions from scaling back and then closing our tempe wafer fabrication facility  and product redesigns 
fiscal versus cost of sales increased by million in fiscal to million 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales declined by basis points to in fiscal  from in the prior year 
the cost of sales changes were as follows cost of sales increase decrease  in millions volume mix change net reserve changes cost reductions the cost of sales increase related to volume was driven by the growth in sales with increases in all market areas except for the expected decline in other products 
the other product category was primarily comprised of products which we had previously placed in an end of life category 
the increase in costs associated with the mix change reflects the smaller portion of sales associated with the non core products which have been generating above average margins as we maximized the return on these products that we are exiting 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the increase in net inventory reserves was primarily associated with an increase in reserve requirements for excess inventories 
in fiscal  our inventory reserve provisions were composed of million for end of life inventories and million for excess inventories  for a total of million compared to million for end of life inventories and million for excess inventories  for a total of million in fiscal the benefit related to sales of previously reserved inventory was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the product cost reductions were the result of our having implemented a strategy to build our core products using external foundries 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we completed the final internal cmos wafer fabrication and converted our tempe manufacturing operations to a dedicated thin film facility to support medical products 
during fiscal  we also subcontracted our chip scale packaging requirements and eliminated our internal capability 
these changes enabled us to reduce our tempe related manufacturing costs by approximately million during fiscal included in fiscal cost of sales was approximately million of charges associated with changes to our internal manufacturing cost structure 
gross margin fiscal versus gross margin increased by million in fiscal to million  which represented a increase from fiscal gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased by basis points to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the increase in gross margin was as follows gross margin increase decrease  in millions cost reductions volume price change net reserve changes mix change product cost reductions were the result of lower subcontractor costs  cost reductions from scaling back and then closing our tempe wafer fabrication facility and product redesigns 
the increased gross margin from volume was driven by a increase in our mobile handset product sales  offset by reductions in our medical  personal computing and other products 
the increase in gross margin from additional volume was offset by the change in mix during fiscal the prices for our products in the mobile handset  personal computing and digital consumer markets are normally expected to decline over time 
during fiscal  the decrease in prices was primarily in our mobile handset products  which was partially offset by increases in medical products for a net negative impact of million 
the change in net inventory reserves was the result of substantially lower sales of previously reserved inventories 
during fiscal  we primarily sold the saleable portion of the end of life products that we had reserved in prior periods and during fiscal a significant portion of the previously reserved end of life inventory was scrapped as there was no longer demand 
the change in product mix was primarily due to a shift to mobile handset products from our medical and other products which had recently been generating above average margins due to end of life pricing and our ability to reduce costs during the shut down related to our medical products exit 

table of contents 
index to financial statements although our fiscal gross margin as a percentage of sales improved over fiscal by basis points to  there was a significant variation within the quarters of fiscal in each of the first two quarters  we generated approximately gross margin  which declined to in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter 
the third quarter was adversely impacted by price declines for some of our core products that exceeded our cost reduction programs  and the proportional decline of our non core sales which were generating above average margins 
the fourth quarter was further impacted by the requirement to recognize larger than normal inventory reserves due to changes in the demand for our older power management products and the further decline in non core product sales 
we expect to improve our gross margin during fiscal with a goal of returning it to the vicinity of on a quarterly basis 
fiscal versus gross margin increased by million in fiscal to million  which represented a increase from fiscal gross margin as a percentage of sales increased by basis points to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the increase in gross margin was as follows gross margin increase decrease  in millions volume cost reductions price change net reserve changes mix change the gross margin increase related to was driven by the increase in sales with increases in all areas except for other products 
the product cost reductions were the result of our having implemented a strategy to build our core products using external foundries 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we completed the final internal cmos wafer fabrication and converted our tempe manufacturing operations to a dedicated thin film facility to support medical products 
during fiscal  we also subcontracted our chip scale packaging requirements and eliminated our internal capability 
these changes enabled us to reduce our tempe related manufacturing costs by approximately million during fiscal included in fiscal cost of sales was approximately million of charges associated with changes to our internal manufacturing cost structure 
the impact of average selling prices was a positive  to gross margin as the increases in medical products and other products exceeded the declines in the core products 
the net reserve change was due to additional reserves for excess inventory as previously discussed in cost of sales 
the mix change was due to the declining portion of total sales represented by the non core business for which we were able to maximize our return on these products primarily due to their end of life status

index to financial statements research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and other employee related costs including bonus  prototypes  and masks for the development of new products and process technologies 
the increases in research and development expenses for fiscal compared to fiscal  and for fiscal compared to fiscal  were as follows fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal expense increase decrease compared to prior fiscal year in thousands salaries and benefits prototype materials depreciation and amortization recruiting and travel other expenses bonus expense salaries and benefits increased in fiscal primarily due to hiring additional engineers to increase new product development activity which in turn resulted in the purchase of additional prototype material as well as equipment and engineering software leading to increased depreciation 
bonus expense declined in fiscal and increased in fiscal due to company performance compared to the performance target in each year s plan 
research and development expenses were of net sales in each of fiscal and  and of net sales in fiscal in the future  we expect research and development to represent to of sales  however  if our sales were to decline in future periods  research and development could represent more than of sales 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and other employee related costs including bonus  sales commissions  marketing and promotional expenses  legal and other professional fees 
the increases in selling  general and administrative expense for fiscal compared to fiscal  and for fiscal compared to fiscal  were as follows fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal expense increase decrease compared to prior fiscal year in thousands outside services salaries and benefits product samples information technology sales commissions travel other expenses bonus expense salaries and benefits increased primarily due to additional staffing in sales and marketing during fiscal  and in all functions in fiscal bonus expense declined in fiscal and increased in fiscal due to company performance compared to the target in each year s plan 
outside services increased in fiscal primarily due to our preparation for and compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
product samples also increased due to additional sales promotion activity and sales commissions increased due to increased sales 
information technology increased due to our implementation of the oracle erp system 

table of contents 
index to financial statements selling  general and administrative expenses were of sales in each of fiscal and  and of sales in fiscal these expenses are expected to increase in dollar terms in the future as sales increase  but at a slower rate than the growth in sales 
as a result  we expect a gradual reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in the future  however  if our sales were to decline in future periods or the costs of compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act or other regulatory requirements were to be higher than we expect  selling  general and administrative expenses could remain the same or increase as a percentage of sales 
restructuring charges 
in fiscal we undertook a restructuring program to close our tempe manufacturing facility and reduce certain other staffing 
as a result  we recognized million of restructuring costs  which were comprised of  for employee severance   for asset impairments and  for other exit costs 
during fiscal  we completed a restructuring program that we initiated during fiscal the cost to implement the program was slightly less than originally projected and as a result we recognized a  benefit related to the reversal of the remaining liability during fiscal other income and expense 
other income and expense  which is comprised primarily of interest expense and interest income  was a net income of  in fiscal  and an expense of million in each of fiscal years and our million public stock offering in may  combined with our continued profitability in fiscal  increased our liquidity enabling us to repay our silicon valley bank debt and industrial revenue bonds and invest the remaining proceeds in short term investments 
paying off debt reduced our interest expense to  in fiscal from  in fiscal interest expense in fiscal and included  and  respectively  of debt issuance costs and prepayment charges 
higher short term investment balances increased our interest income to  in fiscal from  in fiscal other expense in fiscal included a charge of  related to the issuance costs associated with our industrial revenue bonds that we expensed when we prepaid these bonds in march income taxes 
in fiscal our effective tax rate of three percent was the result of our ability to utilize loss carry forwards and other credits  limited by alternative minimum tax provisions 
in and there was no provision for income taxes due to tax losses incurred during each of these periods 
in fiscal  despite our having earned net income on a financial accounting basis  we incurred a loss on a tax basis primarily due to scrapping inventory during the fiscal year 
we have provided a valuation allowance against the total deferred tax assets due to the uncertainties surrounding our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the tax benefits 
see note of notes to financial statements 
if we are consistently profitable in future periods  we may reverse a portion or all of our valuation allowance 
we will continue to evaluate our ability to realize the deferred tax asset 
net income loss 
for the reasons explained above  we realized net income of and in fiscal and  respectively  and a net loss of million in fiscal we were profitable from the second quarter of fiscal through the third quarter of fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we incurred a loss of  due to lower revenues  the decline in gross margins as described above and the restructuring costs associated with the closure of our tempe facility 
as we accomplish our goal of improving gross margin during fiscal  we expect to return to profitability on a quarterly basis 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and the known facts and circumstances that we believe are relevant 
actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to financial statements 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are critical  either because they relate to financial line items that are key indicators of our financial performance eg  revenue or because their application requires significant management judgment  are described in the following paragraphs 

table of contents 
index to financial statements revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is described in note of notes to financial statements 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery or customer acceptance  where applicable  has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenue from product sales to end user customers  or to distributors that do not receive price concessions and do not have return rights  is recognized upon shipment and transfer of risk of loss  if we believe collection is reasonably assured and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
we assess the probability of collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history and the customer s creditworthiness 
if we determine that collection of a receivable is not probable  we defer recognition of revenue until the collection becomes probable  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
reserves for sales returns and allowances from end user customers are estimated based on historical experience and management judgment  and are provided for at the time of shipment 
at the end of each reporting period  the sufficiency of the reserve for sales returns and allowances is also assessed based on a comparison to authorized returns for which a credit memo has not been issued 
revenue from sales of our standard products to distributors whose terms provide for price concessions or for product return rights is recognized when the distributor sells the product to an end customer 
for our end of life products  if we believe that collection is probable  we recognize revenue upon shipment to the distributor  because our contractual arrangements provide for no right of return or price concessions for those products 
when we sell products to distributors  we defer our gross selling price of the product shipped and its related cost and reflect such net amounts on our balance sheet as a current liability entitled deferred margin on shipments to distributors 
inventory and related reserves our inventory and related reserves policy is described in note of notes to financial statements 
forecasting customer demand is the factor in our inventory and related reserves policy that involves significant judgments and estimates 
we establish a reserve for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on a comparison of quantity and cost of inventory on hand to management s forecast of customer demand for the next twelve months 
in forecasting customer demand  we make estimates as to  among other things  the timing of sales  the mix of products sold to customers  the timing of design wins and related volume purchases by new and existing customers  and the timing of existing customers transition to new products 
because a significant portion of our sales are through distributors and the customer demand forecast process may not include all parts  historical trends may also be used in estimating the excess and obsolete inventory reserves 
we review our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory on a quarterly basis considering the known facts 
once a reserve is established  it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or otherwise disposed of 
in fiscal  we wrote down inventory by million to reflect our estimates of excess and obsolete inventories 
also in fiscal  we recognized a benefit of approximately million relating to the sale of inventory that had been reserved in prior periods 
to the extent that our forecast of customer demand materially differs from actual demand  our estimates used in determining cost of sales and gross margin could be impacted 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows from the use of the asset is less than the carrying value of the asset 
the amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value of the assets and their estimated fair value 
during fiscal we closed our tempe  arizona manufacturing facility and idled most of the facility s equipment 
as a consequence  we took an impairment charge and wrote down the assets value by  see note of notes to financial statements

index to financial statements litigation we are a party to lawsuits  claims  investigations  and proceedings  including commercial and employment matters  which are being handled and defended in the ordinary course of business 
we review the current status of any pending or threatened proceedings with our outside counsel on a regular basis and  considering all the known relevant facts and circumstances  we recognize any loss that we consider probable and estimable as of the balance sheet date 
for these purposes  we consider settlement offers we may make to be indicative of such a loss under certain circumstances 
during fiscal years   and  we had two pending cases in which significant damages were sought for which it was difficult to determine the probability of loss and to estimate the resulting damages 
as a result  no accrual was made until we made settlement offers  at which time the amount we offered was accrued 
when these cases were settled during the first quarter of fiscal  the settlement had no income statement impact as the settlement amount had been fully accrued during prior periods 
during fiscal  we accrued additional costs for other cases that were immaterial to our results of operations
