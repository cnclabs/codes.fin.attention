table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with viad corp s consolidated financial statements and related notes 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
viad corp s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated due to various factors discussed under forward looking statements and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview on june   viad corp viad or the company separated its payment services business from its other businesses by means of a tax free spin off 
to effect the separation  travelers express company  inc became a subsidiary of moneygram international  inc moneygram  a newly formed  wholly owned subsidiary of viad  and viad distributed all of the shares of moneygram common stock as a dividend on viad common stock on the date of the spin off 
certain members of viad s board of directors are also directors of moneygram 
the continuing business of viad consists of the businesses of convention show services  exhibit design and construction and travel and recreation services operations as well as viad s centralized corporate functions located in phoenix  arizona 
due to the relative significance of moneygram as compared to the remaining businesses of viad  the transaction was accounted for as a reverse spin off in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for reverse spin offs 
accordingly  moneygram was considered the divesting entity for accounting purposes and is the accounting successor to viad with respect to the historical consolidated financial statements of viad prior to the spin off 
conversely  the remaining combined businesses of viad excluding moneygram represent the entity which was spun off from moneygram international accounting successor to viad corp 
in connection with the completion of the spin off  viad provided notice of redemption to the holders of the company s mandatorily redeemable preferred stock for which the company irrevocably deposited million in a trust clearing account for the benefit of the holders of the preferred shares 
the trust clearing account and the associated preferred stock redemption liability were included in the assets and liabilities of viad following the spin off 
the related loss on redemption of the preferred stock was included in the financial statements of moneygram 
at december   the amount of restricted cash and the preferred stock redemption liability was  in addition  at the annual viad stockholders meeting in may  viad stockholders approved a one for four reverse stock split of the company s common stock whereby  upon completion of the moneygram spin off  every four shares of viad common stock held on july   became one share of viad common stock 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the effects of the one for four reverse stock split for all periods presented 
as a result of the spin off  viad redefined its reportable segments to reflect a disaggregated presentation of the former convention and event services segment and the inclusion of the businesses comprising travel and recreation services as a reportable segment 
accordingly  viad operates in three reportable business segments as follows ges ges exposition services  inc ges provides exhibition and event services throughout north america  such as freight handling  transportation  installation  dismantling and management services to trade associations and show management companies and exhibitors 
ges also provides certain exhibit design and construction services 
exhibitgroup exhibitgroup giltspur exhibitgroup specializes in the large to small scale design  construction  installation and warehousing of convention and trade show exhibits and displays  primarily for corporate customers in north america  and to a lesser extent in europe 
exhibitgroup also provides trade show services to its corporate customers 
travel and recreation services brewster transport company limited brewster provides tourism services in the canadian rockies in alberta and in other parts of western canada 
brewster s operations include the banff gondola  columbia icefield ice explorer tours  motorcoach services  charter and package tours and other sightseeing services  hotel operations and travel agencies 
glacier park  inc glacier park operates four historic lodges and three motor inns and provides food and beverage operations  retail operations and tour and transportation services in and around glacier national park in montana and waterton lakes national park in alberta  canada

adjusted ebitda is defined by viad as net income loss before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  goodwill and intangible asset impairments  changes in accounting principles and the effects of discontinued operations 
adjusted ebitda is considered a useful operating metric as potential variations arising from taxes  depreciation  debt service costs  goodwill and intangible asset impairments  changes in accounting principles and the effects of discontinued operations are eliminated  thus resulting in an additional measure considered to be indicative of viad s ongoing operations 
adjusted ebitda is also used by management to assess viad s ability to service debt  fund capital expenditures and finance growth 
income before impairment losses is defined by viad as income loss from continuing operations before the after tax effect of impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets 
income before impairment losses is utilized by management to review operating results of the business without the effects of noncash impairments 
the presentation of adjusted ebitda and income before impairment losses is supplemental to results presented under gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
these non gaap measures should be considered in addition to  but not a substitute for  other measures of financial performance and liquidity reported in accordance with gaap 
management believes that the presentation of adjusted ebitda and income before impairment losses provides useful information to investors regarding viad s results of operations for trending  analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of viad s business 
management uses adjusted ebitda and income before impairment losses primarily as performance measures and believes that the gaap financial measures most directly comparable to these non gaap measures are net income loss and income loss from continuing operations  respectively 
although adjusted ebitda is used as a financial measure to assess the performance of the business  the use of adjusted ebitda is limited because it does not consider material costs  expenses and other items necessary to operate the business 
these items include debt service costs  noncash depreciation and amortization expense associated with long lived assets  expenses related to federal and state income taxes  noncash goodwill and intangible asset impairments  the effects of accounting changes and discontinued operations 
similarly  although income before impairment losses is used as a financial measure to assess the performance of the business  its use is limited because it does not consider noncash goodwill and intangible asset impairment losses 
because adjusted ebitda and income before impairment losses do not consider the above items  a user of viad s financial information should consider net 
table of contents income loss and income loss from continuing operations important measures of financial performance because they provide a more complete measure of the company s performance 
a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income loss is as follows in thousands adjusted ebitda interest expense recoveries income tax expense depreciation and amortization goodwill and intangible asset impairment losses change in accounting principle income from discontinued operations net income loss the decrease in adjusted ebitda of million from compared to was driven by lower operating income at exhibitgroup and unfavorable restructuring charges

results of operations vs 
revenues for increased percent to million from million in revenue growth at ges and travel and recreation services was largely offset by lower revenue at exhibitgroup 
loss from continuing operations before income taxes was million for  compared to income of million in viad s loss from continuing operations was million  or per share  compared to income of million  or per share  in excluding the goodwill and intangible asset impairment losses recorded in  income before impairment losses see non gaap measures above was million  or per share  versus million  or per share  in the increase was primarily driven by improved segment operating income in the travel and recreation services segment and at ges  which was largely offset by decreased operating results at exhibitgroup 
viad recorded income from discontinued operations of million  or per share  in related to tax matters associated with previously sold operations  primarily favorable foreign tax settlements 
including income from discontinued operations  viad s net loss was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share  in ges 
revenues for ges were million for  an increase of percent compared to million in this increase largely resulted from an increase in revenues from ges s products and services group  which provides elective services to exhibitors  as well as the result of positive show rotation 
this rotation included shows such as international manufacturing technology show  minexpo  international baking industry expo and international woodworking machinery furniture supply fair  which occurred in the third quarter of but did not occur in favorable rotation from these shows was partially offset by negative show rotation in the second quarter of as well as the first quarter of loss of the north american international auto show in detroit due to certain contractor requirements 
in addition  ges benefited 
table of contents from modest same show growth in as the trade show industry saw a slight overall increase in the size of shows as well as an increase in the number of exhibitors and attendees 
segment operating income was million for  up percent from million in operating margins decreased slightly to percent in from percent in ges has experienced pressure on margins due to increased labor and related costs as well as a change in revenue mix 
during the third quarter of  ges experienced a ten day work stoppage in las vegas by the teamsters union and incurred direct costs of approximately million  mainly related to security  thereby negatively affecting operating results 
operating results were also negatively impacted by severe hurricane activity in the southeast  the effects of which are not fully quantifiable 
ges also experienced pressure on higher margin material handling revenue as exhibitors were using lighter exhibits and bringing fewer products to the show floor 
if this trend continues  future operating margins may be negatively affected 
additionally  ges was not able to fully reflect in its prices the increased costs for petroleum based commodities such as carpet  plastics and fuel experienced in the latter part of ges and exhibitgroup are subject to multiple collective bargaining agreements that affect labor costs  about one third of which expire each year 
although labor relations between the companies and labor are currently stable  disruptions during future contract negotiations could occur  with the possibility of an adverse impact on the operating results of ges and or exhibitgroup 
additionally  show rotation into certain markets in is expected to increase the need for labor above the supply in those local markets 
ges is working with its labor unions to meet the necessary labor requirements in these markets  however  any shortages could adversely affect future revenue and operating income 
ges s revenue growth is dependent upon  among other things  show rotation  general economic conditions and levels of exhibitor spending 
in general  the trade show industry is experiencing signs of slight to modest growth in terms of square footage and number of exhibitors 
management believes that further improvements in the economy and corporate earnings could lead to increased show spending 
the prospects for individual shows tend to be driven by the success of the industry related to those shows 
certain industries have performed very well ie health care and defense while others have had more difficulty 
technology experienced several cancellations for shows which were expected to occur in ges has a diversified revenue base and is generally insulated from industry specific trends 
in response to lower material handling revenue and increased labor and other costs  management continues to emphasize cost containment  productivity improvements and revenue growth through greater market penetration into exhibitor elective spending 
management is also pursuing price increases to cover the recent increase in the cost of petroleum based commodities 
exhibitgroup 
revenues for exhibitgroup were million for  down percent from million in the decline in revenues was driven mainly by weak demand for the design and construction of new exhibits  primarily due to diminished corporate spending and continued softness in the general economy  as many exhibitors elected to reuse or refurbish existing exhibits rather than placing orders for new construction 
customer losses also contributed to the overall revenue decline 
these losses occurred as the result of unfavorable pricing  which management believes would have led to unprofitable business 
segment operating loss was million for compared to operating income of million in the decline in operating income was due to the continued erosion of sales revenue  particularly new construction revenue that resulted in a less profitable mix of business 
margins on construction revenue are roughly twice that of show services provided by exhibitgroup 
construction revenues  including exhibit and kiosk construction  accounted for only to percent of exhibitgroup s total revenues in compared to to percent in and compared to historical norms of to percent 
this change in the revenue mix has contributed to lower margins and operating losses despite cost control efforts 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires companies to test goodwill and certain intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis 
impairment testing is also required between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
during the third quarter of  exhibitgroup s operating results were affected by a significant reduction in revenue from new exhibit construction that caused management to reduce its outlook for the full year 
as a result of this potential impairment indicator  viad performed interim goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests for the exhibitgroup reporting unit 
based on this interim testing  management concluded that a goodwill impairment loss was necessary and that a trademark intangible impairment loss was probable 
accordingly  viad recorded a charge of million million after tax  representing the entire carrying amount of exhibitgroup s goodwill  and a charge of million million after tax representing management s preliminary estimate of the trademark s impairment 
management finalized 
table of contents the valuation of the trademark during the fourth quarter of and recorded an additional impairment charge of million  after tax 
viad uses a discounted expected future cash flow methodology in order to estimate the fair value of its reporting units and its intangible assets 
the estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows  terminal values and the discount rate require considerable judgment and are based on historical experience  financial forecasts and industry trends and conditions 
these estimates  however  have inherent uncertainties  and different assumptions could lead to materially different results 
during the fourth quarter of  management saw some stabilization of new exhibit construction revenue and pricing 
however  competitive pricing in exhibitgroup s kiosk market resulted in lower  new kiosk construction revenue and margins 
new kiosk construction  which viad includes in overall construction  approximated five percent of exhibitgroup s total revenue in as compared to more than eight percent in visibility over revenues continues to be poor and a sustained increase in customer marketing spending on new exhibit construction has not materialized to date 
if the prolonged weakness in demand for new exhibits and pricing pressures on kiosks continue  revenue could decline further and operating income could be similarly affected 
management remains focused on cost control  productivity enhancements  customer service improvements and innovative pricing strategies in order to preserve and increase operating margins over the longer term 
travel and recreation services 
revenues for the travel and recreation services segment were million for  up percent from million in segment operating income was million for compared to million in operating margins increased to percent in from percent in in  revenues and operating income in this segment were reduced by lower visitation rates primarily caused by instability abroad  the outbreak of certain health issues and air canada s financial difficulties 
overall business activity in recovered with strong increases in revenues and operating income reflecting improved visitation rates at brewster  especially from the far east 
as compared to  passenger volumes were up percent for brewster s ice explorer tours going to the columbia icefield  and up percent for the banff gondola  which takes passengers to the summit of sulphur mountain 
glacier park generated percent of the travel and recreation services segment s full year operating income and its season is primarily in the third quarter of each year 
during  glacier park remained open the entire summer season resulting in greatly improved revenues and operating income in as compared to forest fires during the third quarter of had a significantly negative impact on the business s results for as portions of glacier park s operations were forced to close twice during the peak season 
glacier park generated percent of the travel and recreation services segment s full year operating income 
glacier park s concession contract with the us national park service the park service expires at the end of  at which time a new concessionaire may be selected by the park service and viad s glacier park operation would consist only of the operations at waterton lakes  canada  and east glacier  montana  which are not part of the concession contract 
in such a circumstance  viad would be entitled to an amount equal to its possessory interest  which generally means the value of the structures acquired or constructed  fixtures installed or improvements made to glacier national park during the term of the contract  based on the reconstruction cost of a new unit of like kind  less depreciation  but not to exceed fair market value 
while the option exists for the park service to extend glacier park s contract for up to three years  it is not currently known if it will do so 
corporate activities 
corporate activities expense decreased  from to this was largely due to the reduction of compensation and employee benefit costs and facility costs as a result of the moneygram spin off 
interest expense 
interest expense was million in compared to interest recoveries of million in the amount reflects a reversal of million of previously accrued interest due to favorable income tax settlements 
interest expense in was million before giving effect to the reversal above  which is higher than the amount as average debt balances were lower in income taxes 
the effective tax rate before goodwill and intangible asset impairment losses was percent for compared to percent for the decrease from was due to net favorable income tax settlements and adjustments recorded in the third quarter of as well as higher state income tax expense associated with adjustments for potentially unrealizable future benefits of state net operating losses 

table of contents vs 
revenues for decreased percent to million from million in the decline was primarily driven by negative show rotation and weaker demand for the design and construction of new exhibits 
this decline reflected the downturn in the general economy and diminished corporate spending 
viad also experienced moderate declines in travel and recreation services revenues

ges 
revenues for ges were million for compared to million in the decline in revenues largely resulted from net negative show rotation  where shows rotating out of  such as the international manufacturing technology show  outweighed the shows rotating into  such as the national plastics expositions and worldwide food show 
the sequential year over year declines in show attendance  the number of exhibiting companies and convention square footage resulting from weak overall economic conditions since led to lower demand for services  cancelled shows and show shrinkage which contributed to the revenue decline 
segment operating income was million for  down percent from million in operating margins increased slightly to percent in from percent in exhibitgroup 
revenues for exhibitgroup were million for  down percent from million in segment operating income was million for compared to an operating loss of million in the decline in revenues was driven by weak demand for the design and construction of new exhibits  primarily due to diminished corporate spending and continued softness in the general economy  as many exhibitors elected to reuse or refurbish existing exhibits rather than placing orders for new construction 
segment operating income increased during primarily due to the effectiveness of management initiatives to improve performance  including restructuring efforts 
travel and recreation services 
revenues for the travel and recreation services segment were million for  down percent from million in segment operating income was million for compared to million in operating margins decreased to percent in from percent in these businesses were negatively impacted by a continued decline in the world travel market due to ongoing threats of terrorism  the war in iraq  health issues sars  mad cow disease and west nile virus  air canada s financial difficulties and wildfires in and around glacier national park 
since the events of september   worldwide leisure travel had been on a steady decline  directly affecting the travel and recreation services segment with reduced visitation during and again in in  these businesses were also severely affected by the announcement in april that air canada  which serves a large portion of visitors to these businesses  was experiencing financial difficulty and had filed for protection under canada s companies creditors arrangement act 
this event reduced the capacity of transportation available for visitors to western canada 
visitor travel from asia  long a key market for these businesses  was significantly lower in  primarily due to the outbreak of sars in asia in late a subsequent sars outbreak in canada reduced the number of travelers coming to canada from the united states and europe 
lastly  during the peak summer season of  wildfires in and around glacier national park forced the closure and evacuation of many of viad s hotels and attractions 
despite the fact that the fires were under control in late summer  significant reservation cancellations left the businesses operating far below capacity 
given glacier national park s limited visitation season  the lost business could not be recouped elsewhere 
the impact of the above reductions in revenue in from also impacted operating income 
while certain of the costs of these businesses can be pared down for certain fluctuations in visitor attendance  many of the unforeseen events of left these businesses with excess costs relative to revenue 
the forest fires  in particular  forced these businesses to maintain overhead costs to ensure sufficient resources were available to facilitate the closures and subsequent re openings  and to service the visitors 
thus  while revenues were down percent  expenses could not be shed as rapidly  resulting in an operating income decline that disproportionately exceeded the revenue decline 
corporate activities 
corporate activities expense increased  from to this increase was due primarily to higher insurance premiums and employee benefit costs

interest recoveries were million in compared to interest expense of million in the amount reflects a reversal of million of previously accrued interest due to favorable income tax settlements 
interest expense in was million before giving effect to the reversal above  which is lower than the amount as average debt balances and interest rates were lower in income taxes 
the effective tax rate was percent for compared to percent for the relatively high rate compared to the federal statutory rate of percent was due to higher state income tax expense associated with adjustments for potentially unrealizable future benefits of state net operating losses 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million at december  as compared to million at december   with the increase primarily due to net distributions from moneygram and to cash flow from operations 
viad s total debt at december  was million compared with million at december  the debt to capital ratio was to at december  compared with to at december  capital is defined as total debt plus minority interests and common stock and other equity 
long term debt at december  includes an allocated portion of viad s historical debt balances 
for the purpose of preparing viad s financial statements prior to the moneygram spin off  the historical allocation of debt was based on the prorated level of debt estimated to be assumed by new viad at the time of the spin off 
of the total debt balance of million at december   million represented debt obligations directly attributable to new viad s operations and million represents allocated general corporate debt of viad 
effective june   viad entered into a million secured revolving credit agreement with eight lenders 
the term of the credit facility is three years expiring on june  and borrowings are to be used for general corporate purposes including permitted acquisitions and to support up to million of letters of credit 
the lenders have a first perfected security interest in all of the personal property of viad and ges  including percent of the capital stock of top tier foreign subsidiaries 
ges is a guarantor of the facility 
borrowings under the facility are indexed to the prime rate or the london interbank offering rate  plus appropriate spreads tied to viad s leverage ratio 
commitment fees and letters of credit fees are also tied to viad s leverage ratio 
at december   viad had an outstanding borrowing of million under the revolving credit agreement which was used to repay the esop debt obligation described below 
with the termination of viad s previous credit facilities upon the moneygram spin off  million of letters of credit automatically transitioned to the new million credit agreement 
financial covenants include a minimum consolidated net worth requirement of not less than million plus percent of positive quarterly consolidated net income earned in each fiscal quarter beginning with the quarter ended december   a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to  and a leverage ratio defined as total debt to adjusted ebitda of not greater than to significant other covenants include limitations on investments  common stock dividends  stock repurchases  additional indebtedness  sales leases of assets  acquisitions  consolidations or mergers  liens on property  capital expenditures and operating leases 
at december   viad was in compliance with all covenants 
in july  viad borrowed million under the revolving credit agreement described above to pay in full the esop debt obligation and release viad from its guarantee of the loan 
viad became the new lender to the esop  under essentially the same terms as the previous bank loan  to preserve the continuity of the esop and the release of viad shares to participants accounts through june this transaction did not result in a net change to the company s outstanding debt 
under a shelf registration filed with the sec  viad can issue up to an aggregate million of debt and equity securities 
no securities have been issued under the program 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  totaled million as compared to million in these expenditures primarily related to certain leasehold improvements  information systems and related costs  and manufacturing and other equipment 
in january  viad sold a percent interest in its corporate aircraft to moneygram for million in cash 
the purchase price was determined by reference to third party appraisals that indicated a fair market value which closely approximated the net book value of the aircraft 
accordingly  there was no gain or loss in connection with the transaction 
viad and moneygram will share in the fixed costs of operating the aircraft while each will pay the variable costs depending on the usage by each company 
in february  viad repaid its senior notes outstanding of million pursuant to their scheduled maturities

viad is subject to various us federal  state and foreign laws and regulations governing the prevention of pollution and the protection of the environment in the jurisdictions in which viad has or had operations 
if viad has failed to comply with these environmental laws and regulations  civil and criminal penalties could be imposed and viad could become subject to regulatory enforcement actions in the form of injunctions and cease and desist orders 
as is the case with many companies  viad also faces exposure to actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters relating to viad s past operations

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations  and that require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on these criteria  viad has identified and discussed with its audit committee the following critical accounting policies and estimates pertaining to viad  and the methodology and disclosures related to those estimates goodwill sfas no 
requires annual impairment testing of goodwill based on the estimated fair value of viad s reporting units 
the fair value of viad s reporting units is estimated based on discounted expected future cash flows using a weighted average cost of capital rate 
additionally  an assumed terminal value is used to project future cash flows beyond base years 
the estimates and assumptions regarding expected cash flows  terminal values and the discount rate require considerable judgment and are based on historical experience  financial forecasts and industry trends and conditions 
during  viad recorded a transitional goodwill impairment loss of million million after tax related to exhibitgroup 
subsequent to the initial adoption of sfas no 
 annual impairment tests were performed in and resulting in no additional impairment 
as discussed above  customer orders for new exhibit construction at exhibitgroup declined further than management had anticipated in the third quarter of resulting in a less profitable mix of business  causing management to reduce its outlook for the full year 
in  viad performed goodwill and intangible asset impairment 
table of contents tests at exhibitgroup and concluded that impairment losses were necessary on exhibitgroup s goodwill and trademark intangible asset 
accordingly  viad recorded a charge of million million after tax  representing the entire carrying amount of exhibitgroup s goodwill  and a charge of million million after tax based upon a third party s assessment of the trademark s value resulting in a remaining trademark book value of million 
as of december   viad has recorded goodwill of million and million related to ges and travel and recreation services  respectively 
goodwill and unamortized intangible assets are typically tested for impairment annually as of october of each year 
insurance liabilities viad is self insured up to certain limits for workers compensation  automobile  product and general liability and property loss claims 
the aggregate amount of insurance liabilities related to viad s continuing operations was million as of december  of this total  million related to workers compensation liabilities and the remaining million related to general auto liability claims 
viad has also retained and provided for certain insurance liabilities in conjunction with previously sold businesses totaling million at december   primarily related to workers compensation liabilities 
provisions for losses for claims incurred  including estimated claims incurred but not yet reported  are made based on viad s prior historical experience  claims frequency and other factors 
viad has purchased insurance for amounts in excess of the self insured levels 
the self insured retention levels generally range from  to  on a per claim basis 
a change in the assumptions used could result in an adjustment to recorded liabilities 
viad does not maintain a self insured retention pool fund as claims are paid from current cash resources at the time of settlement 
viad s net cash payments in connection with these insurance liabilities were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
postretirement benefits other than pensions viad and certain of its subsidiaries have defined benefit postretirement plans that provide medical and life insurance for certain eligible employees  retirees and dependents 
the related postretirement benefit liabilities are recognized over the period that services are provided by employees 
in addition  viad retained the obligations for these benefits for retirees of certain sold businesses 
while the plans have no funding requirements  viad may fund the plans 
the assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was ten percent in the year  declining one percent each year to the ultimate rate of five percent by the year and remaining at that level thereafter 
the assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was nine percent in the year  declining one percent each year to the ultimate rate of five percent by the year and remaining at that level thereafter 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december  by approximately million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately  a one percentage point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december  by approximately million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately  see recent accounting pronouncements below for a discussion of financial accounting standards board fasb staff position fsp fas related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the weighted average discount rates used to determine benefit obligations at december  and were percent and percent  respectively 
the weighted average discount rates used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the years ended december  and were percent and percent  respectively 
the expected return on plans assets used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the years ended december  and were both percent 
stock based compensation as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  viad uses the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for its stock based compensation plans 
accordingly  viad does not use the fair value method to value stock options in accordance with sfas no 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for the pro forma impact of stock based awards using the fair value method of accounting 
income taxes viad is required to estimate and record provisions for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
accordingly  the company must estimate its actual current income tax liability  and assess temporary differences arising from the treatment of items for tax purposes as compared to the treatment for accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in viad s consolidated balance sheets 
the company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
as of december  and  viad had gross deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively 
viad does not have a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets as management believes that recovery from future taxable income is likely 
viad is subject to regular and recurring audits by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which the company conducts or had previously conducted significant operations 
accordingly  the company maintains reserves associated with various federal  state and foreign tax audit exposures that may arise in connection with such audits 
as of december   viad had million accrued for these exposures 
if the reserves are less than amounts ultimately assessed by the taxing authorities  viad must record additional income tax expense in the period in which the assessment is determined 
to the extent that the company has favorable settlements  or determines that reserves are no longer needed  such reserves are reversed as a reduction of income tax expense  or in some cases through discontinued operations  in the period such determination is made 
viad s policy is to retain amounts accrued for tax audit exposures until final resolution with the appropriate taxing authority 
based on tax audits in process and other factors  management currently estimates that tax issues of approximately million could potentially be resolved or settled during resulting in a decrease of accrued taxes payable 
to the extent these tax resolutions or settlements occur  they would result in cash payments and or the reversal of accrued taxes payable which may include amounts related to previously discontinued operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued fsp fas on the accounting for the effects of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act  which was enacted into law on december   and which provides a federal subsidy to employers that sponsor postretirement health care plans that provide certain prescription drug benefits to the extent such benefits are deemed actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
the company made a one time election  under the previously issued fsp fas  to defer recognition of the effects of the act until further authoritative 
table of contents guidance was issued 
with fsp fas  which superceded fsp fas  guidance was provided in accounting for the subsidy  effective for the first reporting period beginning after june  the company adopted fsp fas on july  using the prospective method 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for the effects of the act on viad s financial position and results of operations 
in january  final regulations were released by the centers for medicare and medicaid services in determining the medical prescription drug benefit and other key elements of the act  including actuarial equivalence 
the company has not yet determined if these additional regulations will have a significant impact on viad s financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter 
sfas no 
seeks to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage in the determination of inventory carrying costs 
the statement requires such costs to be treated as a current period expense and is effective for fiscal years beginning after july  the company has not yet determined if the adoption of sfas no 
will have a significant impact on viad s financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
sfas no 
r replaced sfas no 
and superceded apb opinion no 
sfas no 
r will require compensation costs related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements 
as permitted by sfas no 
 viad elected to follow the guidance of apb opinion no 
 which allowed companies to use the intrinsic value method of accounting to value their share based payment transactions with employees 
based on this method  viad has not recognized compensation expense in its financial statements as the stock options granted had an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
sfas no 
r requires measurement of the cost of share based payment transactions to employees at the fair value of the award on the grant date and recognition of expense over the service or vesting period 
viad will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r on july  using the modified prospective method  under which compensation expense for the unvested portion of previously granted awards and all new awards will be recognized in the financial statements over the service period 
management believes the adoption of sfas no 
r may have a material impact on its results of operations  however  the company has not yet completed its evaluation of sfas no 
r  and has therefore not quantified the financial impact upon adoption 
in december  the fasb issued fsp fas related to the application of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of the jobs creation act 
fsp fas clarifies that the manufacturer s deduction provided for under the jobs creation act should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with sfas no 
and not as a tax rate reduction 
the adoption of fsp fas is not expected to have a material impact on viad s financial position or results of operations in in december  the fasb also issued fsp fas related to accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the jobs creation act 
the jobs creation act introduces a special one time dividend received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer provided certain criteria are met 
currently  management has not yet determined the amount of foreign earnings  if any  to be repatriated by viad
