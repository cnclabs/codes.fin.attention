item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s long term goal is to enhance its position as one of the largest providers of real estate transaction services 
to accomplish this objective  the company has expanded its operations through internal growth and selective strategic acquisitions 
the company s business operations are organized under three primary business segments title insurance  lender services and financial services 
other operating business segments not required to be reported separately are reported in a category called corporate and other 
these groupings of business operations are consistent with the way the company s management views its business results and consistent with financial accounting standards board release no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the company s dominant business operation continues to be its title insurance segment which accounted for and of the company s operating revenues in and  respectively 
title insurance the company s title insurance segment is influenced by the level of real estate activity and the cost and availability of mortgage funds 
the demand for the company s title insurance products and services is dependent upon  among other things  the volume of residential and commercial real estate transactions  including mortgage refinancing transactions 
the volume of these transactions has historically been influenced by factors such as interest rates and the state of the overall economy 
for example  when interest rates are increasing or during an economic downturn or recession  real estate activity typically declines and the company experiences lower revenues and profitability 
the cyclical nature of the company s business has caused fluctuations in revenues and profitability in the past and is expected to do so in the future 
prior to  the company also experienced seasonality within a particular year 
due to the historically low interest rates in the last three years  the company s results have not followed their typical seasonal patterns 
the company anticipates that its normal seasonality will return in future periods 
see cyclicality and seasonality below 
the company s title insurance segment revenues include title insurance premiums  escrow fees and fees for other ancillary services 
premiums and fees are determined both by competition and by state regulation 
in addition  title insurance segment revenues are affected by the company s sales and marketing efforts 
revenue from company owned title operations is recognized at the time real estate transactions close 
there can be a several month delay between the time that a title order is opened and the real estate transaction closes 
consequently  expenses may be incurred related to a direct title order in advance of revenues being recognized 
operating revenues from independent agents are recognized when the company receives notification from the agent that a policy has been issued 
agent notification typically occurs later than the closing of the real estate transaction 
the delay in notification varies from year to year  from agent to agent and between regions of the country 
during  the company experienced an average delay between closing and reporting by agents of approximately days 
the delay in notification by agents not only delays revenue recognition but may also create a significant lag between changes in general real estate activity and the impact of such changes on the portion of the company s title insurance segment revenues attributable to agents 
the company s profit margins are affected by several factors  including the volume of real estate and mortgage refinance activity  title policy type and amount 
volume is an important determinant of profitability because the company  like any other real estate services company  has a significant level of fixed costs arising from personnel  occupancy costs and maintenance of title plants 
the company utilizes title orders opened as a forward looking indicator of business volume 
because premiums are based on the face amount of the policy  larger policies generate higher premiums although expenses of issuance do not necessarily increase in proportion to policy size 
cancellations affect profitability because costs incurred both in opening and in processing orders typically are not offset by fees 
the company s results are also impacted during times of increasing or decreasing volumes since the company cannot immediately match its staffing requirements to changes in its business volumes 
the company s largest expense is commissions paid to agents 
the company regularly reviews the profitability of its agents  adjusting commission levels or canceling certain agents where profitability objectives are not being met and expanding operations where acceptable levels of profitability are available 
the company continually monitors its operating expenses which are the sum of salaries and employee benefits  agency commissions and other expenses exclusive of interest  amortization and certain other items as a percentage of operating revenues 
generally  title insurance claims rates are lower than other types of insurance because title insurance policies insure against prior events affecting the quality of real estate titles rather than against unforeseen  and therefore less predictable  future events 
see critical accounting estimates policy and contract claims for further discussion 
in addition  the company may be subject to claims and litigation other than in the ordinary course of business 
in  the company settled certain outstanding litigation resulting in a pre tax charge to earnings of approximately million in the fourth quarter 
in addition  in  the company received requests for information and subpoenas from certain states seeking information relating to investigations of the business practices of the company and the title insurance industry 
multiple states are specifically investigating reinsurance 
the company may receive additional requests for information and or subpoenas in the future 
the company expects to cooperate with all such requests or subpoenas 
state investigations may pose a significant challenge in for a discussion of pending material legal proceedings  see item legal proceedings 
operating revenues in were slightly lower than in reflecting reduced residential activity partially offset by increased revenue achieved through acquisitions and increased levels of commercial real estate activity 
operating revenues in benefited from record setting levels of mortgage and refinancing activities 
for fiscal year  the company expects interest rates to rise and growth to continue through acquisitions  however  as interest rates rise  the volume of residential activity is expected to continue to decline consistent with the cyclical nature of the title insurance business 
as a result  operating results for the years ended through should not be viewed as indicative of results for any future period 
to counter this trend  the company has initiated a sales enhancement process to spur organic sales growth 
the sales process trains the company s sales personnel to effectively market the company s title insurance and related products and services to its customers 
the company continually evaluates its cost structure to optimize it for anticipated business levels 
in response to declining mortgage volumes  the company implemented a cost reduction program begun in the fourth quarter of aimed at reducing staffing and cost levels within existing operations to a level more consistent with anticipated transaction volumes 
as a result  in the first quarter of  the company announced plans to further reduce its cost structure within existing operations by at least million on an annualized basis 
at june   the company had implemented reductions to achieve at least the targeted cost savings 
although the company s staffing and cost levels were reduced as a result of the aforementioned plans  the company saw an overall increase in salaries and employee benefits and general and administrative expenses during primarily due to the company s acquisitions 
in  the company will continue its evaluation and integration of acquisitions 
the company completed title insurance segment acquisitions during and will evaluate potential acquisition opportunities as they arise 
lender services the company s lender services segment provides services to regional and national lending institutions which complement those offered in the company s title insurance business 
these services consist primarily of real estate tax processing and flood certification services  mortgage credit reporting  default management services  and mortgage loan subservicing 
with the exception of a portion of default management  the services provided by this segment are the result of businesses acquired by the company during and in december  the company purchased loancare servicing center  inc loancare  a large mortgage loan subservicer 
in october  the company entered the business of providing flood certification and real estate tax services to mortgage lenders by purchasing landamerica tax flood services  inc  formerly known as lereta corp 
latf  one of the largest tax and flood service companies in the united states 
the company initially entered the credit information business for the mortgage lending industry through its acquisition in august of info holding company  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company s subsidiary landamerica credit services  inc lacs 
during  the company expanded the national scope of its businesses in these areas through the purchase of one flood certification business  four credit reporting businesses and one default management business 
the lender services segment currently realizes approximately half of its reported revenues through service revenues associated with tracking and reporting of real estate tax payments and flood zone certifications related to mortgage loans for lending institutions 
the company s servicing agreements typically call for the company to service the mortgage loan until cancellation or sale 
the lenders pay for these services at the time they add a loan to their servicing portfolio 
the company defers a significant portion of its revenue received for these services to account for the life of loan servicing aspects of the contracts 
as a result  revenue reported in the financial statements represents the amortization of both current and prior service fees and is not representative of new contract sales levels 
expenses on the other hand are charged to the income statement as incurred and are not deferred 
thus  an understanding of the levels of deferred revenues or new contract cash received in this area is critical to understanding the relative strength of underlying business related to tax and flood services 
the estimated life of loans is reviewed regularly to determine if there have been changes in contract lives and or changes in the number or timing of prepayments  and adjusted to reflect current trends 
the company is required in certain instances to reimburse part of the fees should the lender sell the loan to another party 
see further discussion in critical accounting estimates below 
revenues in mortgage credit reporting  default management services and loan subservicing are recognized when the report or service is delivered to the customer 
this segment has a substantial opportunity to leverage the company s title insurance segment business relationships to cross sell services to other financial institutions 
a significant challenge for these businesses is their integration into the company s overall structure without jeopardizing their current business relationships 
during the company began offering a bundled product solution  primarily to its national lender customers  which includes products offered by the title insurance segment and businesses included in lender services 
the company expects to continue expanding organically and by acquisition in this segment and by focusing on the realization of cross selling opportunities 
financial services the business reported in this segment includes orange county bancorp and its wholly owned subsidiary  centennial bank  a california industrial bank acquisition the company made in november centennial 
centennial s primary business is the origination and bulk purchase of commercial real estate loans in the southern california marketplace and is dependent on the viability of the commercial real estate market in southern california 
deposits are solicited through the internet for both certificates of deposit and passbook savings accounts 
as an industrial bank  centennial does not accept demand deposits  such as checking accounts  that provide for payment to third parties 
centennial does not offer banking services such as credit cards or automated teller machines 
the company utilizes centennial to hold a portion of its escrow deposits 
the company anticipates expanding its utilization of centennial to facilitate escrow balance transactions 
corporate and other this group includes businesses that are not significant enough in size to be reported as separate segments as well as the unallocated portion of the corporate expenses including unallocated interest expense related to the company s corporate offices in richmond  virginia 
the businesses reported in this group provide commercial and residential inspections  commercial appraisals and assessments  and home warranties 
the company s assessment business is managed by the company s landamerica assessment corporation subsidiary that was acquired in and which is headquartered in california 
this business provides due diligence services to commercial customers throughout the united states  canada  mexico  the caribbean and europe 
revenue is recognized upon completion of the services to the customer 
the company s commercial and residential inspection services are run by the company s inspectech  inc subsidiary 
its business is highly dependent on the real estate industry and the levels of residential home sales and refinancings 
inspectech  inc charges a flat fee for each transaction which is generally collected at the time of service 
the company s commercial appraisal and valuation operation is run by the company s subsidiary landamerica valuation corporation  formerly known as landamerica commercial appraisal corporation 
its business is highly dependent on the commercial real estate market 
a fee is charged based on the type and complexity of work performed 
in september  the company purchased buyers home warranty company bhw  headquartered in california  which provides and services home warranty contracts in california  texas  arizona  colorado  nevada  new mexico  and oklahoma 
fees charged by this business are deferred upon receipt and amortized over the life of the underlying contract which is generally one year 
critical accounting estimates this discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s accompanying consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company considers the following accounting estimates to be critical in preparing and understanding such statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
policy and contract claims in the title insurance segment  consistent with the requirements of fas no 
 a provision for estimated future claims payments is recorded at the time policy revenue is recorded 
this estimate is recorded as a percentage of revenue 
the payment experience of the company and the title insurance industry extends for more than years after the issuance of a policy 
due to the length of time over which claim payments are made and regularly occurring changes in underlying economic conditions  these estimates are subject to variability 
the company considers factors such as historical timing of claims reported and historical timing of claims paid over the period in which policies are effective against actual experience by year of policy issue to determine the amount of claims reserves required for each year for which policies are outstanding 
the company also considers the impact of current trends in marketplace activity  such as refinance activity which may shorten the time period a policy is outstanding  bankruptcies  and individual large claims attributable to any particular period in determining the expected liability associated with each year 
since there is an extended time period for which the company is liable  slight changes in current claims experience can result in a significant impact in the amount of liability required for potential incurred but not reported ibnr claims 
loss provision rates are reviewed periodically and adjusted by management as experience develops or new information becomes known 
the company s independent consulting actuaries review projections of required reserves as considered necessary during the year and at year end 
these projections are compared to recorded reserves to evaluate the adequacy of such recorded reserves and any necessary adjustments are included in current expenses 
the impact on pre tax income of a percent change in the loss rate for title operations on current year business volumes is as follows increase in loss rate of million decrease in loss rate of million purchase accounting and goodwill and long lived assets valuations during the years ended december  and  the company completed and acquisitions  respectively 
these acquisitions were intended to grow the company s title operations and expand its real estate transaction services portfolio 
as a result of these acquisitions  the company assigned fair values to the assets and liabilities purchased and increased the amount of goodwill and other intangibles recorded on its balance sheet 
the company utilizes the services of an independent appraisal company to assist it with the allocation of purchase price to acquired assets including goodwill and liabilities 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  which required that the company discontinue amortizing goodwill and begin assessing the recoverability of goodwill for each of its reporting units 
reporting units are business components of an operating segment  and goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit which benefits from the synergies arising from each business acquisition 
the company tests for the recoverability of goodwill annually or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of its reporting units  including goodwill  may exceed their fair values 
the fair value of the reporting units is determined using cash flow analysis which projects the future cash flows produced by the reporting units and discounts those cash flows to the present value 
the projection of future cash flows is necessarily dependent upon assumptions on the future levels of income as well as business trends  prospects and market and economic conditions 
when the fair value is less than the carrying value for the net assets of the reporting unit  including goodwill  impairment loss may be charged to operations 
based on the company s annual analysis  no impairment was identified for the year ending december  see further details in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the company s intangible assets include technology  customer relations  and non competition arrangements which are all amortized over their useful lives 
pursuant to sfas no 
 for intangible assets that are amortizable with definite lives  tests for impairment must be performed if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
such conditions may include a loss of a significant customer or a change in the assessment of future operations 
based on our review for the year ending december   there was no impairment of intangible assets 
the company also reviews the status of its title plants at least annually 
periodically  the company determines that a title plant will no longer be used or has been abandoned 
in those instances  the company takes a charge to earnings when it determines that the plant has been abandoned 
the company anticipates that it may take additional charges in future periods as state and local courts and municipalities continue to automate their property records and make them available through electronic media 
as part of its process of reviewing long lived assets  during and at december  the company identified and title plants  respectively  in the title insurance segment with aggregate book values of million and million  respectively  that will not continue to be used or maintained 
accordingly  the company recorded impairment losses of million and million  respectively  which is reflected in write off of title plants in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets many deductions for tax return purposes cannot be taken until the expenses are actually paid  rather than when the expenses are recorded under generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in these circumstances  under gaap  companies accrue for the tax benefit expected to be received in future years if  in the judgment of management  it is more likely than not that the company will receive such benefits 
the most significant factor in this determination is the projected future timing and amounts of taxable income 
if management determines that it is no longer more likely than not that an asset will be utilized  the company would record a valuation allowance which would reduce net income in the period recorded 
deferred tax assets created from tax benefits expected to be realized at december  and relate primarily to policy and contract claims  goodwill  pension liability  deferred service arrangements  allowance for doubtful accounts and employee benefit plans offset by deferred tax liabilities primarily related to other intangibles  unrealized gains on the company s investment portfolio  title plants and fixed assets 
based upon the company s historical results of operations  the existing financial condition of the company and management s assessment of all other available evidence  management believes that these assets will more likely than not be realized 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
pension and other postretirement benefits the company has pension and other retirement benefit plans covering substantially all employees 
these plans are valued annually by an actuary who employs significant assumptions that are particularly important when determining our projected liabilities for pension and other postretirement benefits 
payments related to these benefits will be made by the company over a lengthy period and the projected liability will be impacted by assumptions regarding inflation  investment returns and market interest rates  changes in the benefit obligations and laws and regulations covering the benefit obligations 
one significant assumption is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
a lower expected return on plan assets increases the amount of pension expense and the liability decreases as the discount rate increases 
the use of expected long term rates of return may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than actual returns in any given year 
over time the expected returns are used to approximate actual long term returns which result in a pattern of expense recognition that more closely matches the service lives of typical employees 
the company uses long term and actual historical returns  current and targeted asset mix and future estimates of long term investment returns to develop its long term return for plan assets 
the company s anticipated rate of return was as of the valuation date 
another significant assumption in valuing the pension liability is the discount rate 
in general  the liability increases as the discount rate decreases and the liability decreases as the discount rate increases 
the discount rate utilized is based on rates on high quality fixed income debt instruments available at the end of each valuation period 
the company utilized a discount rate of in determining its benefit obligations 
changing the discount rate or long term rate of return would result in the following impact on the pension benefit liability projected benefit obligation increase of in discount rate million decrease of in discount rate million additionally  assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefits 
a one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects one percentage point increase one percentage point decrease in millions effect on total of service and interest cost effect on postretirement benefit obligation on october   the company announced that effective december  it was ceasing future accruals to the retirement plan accounts of all plan participants provided in the company s cash balance pension plan the plan other than annual interest credits on account balances 
the changes impacting the plan most significantly are fully vesting accrued benefits to participants in the plan as of december   and limiting participation in the plan to those individuals who were participants in the plan as of december  see further information in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the change  the company had to adopt curtailment accounting for the plan as specified under fas no 
the curtailment resulted in the company recording a one time gain of approximately million and increasing the minimum pension liability by million at december  deferred service arrangements when the company acquired tax and flood and home warranty companies  all of their assets and liabilities were adjusted to fair value in accordance with purchase method accounting 
in making these adjustments  each entity s deferred revenue account  representing amounts which had been deferred and would have been amortized over the remaining lives of the contracts for the provision of real estate tax monitoring  flood certification services  and home warranty services existing at the acquisition date  was eliminated 
the deferred revenue account was replaced with an account called deferred service obligations representing the estimated fair value of the obligation to provide the required services over the remaining life of the subject contracts 
this account  established as of the acquisition date  is being amortized over the remaining lives of existing contracts 
as previously noted  real estate tax monitoring  flood certification fees  and home warranty service fees received on new contracts entered into since the acquisition dates are deferred and amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts to which they relate 
the sum of amortization of the initial deferred service obligation and amortization related to fees accrued on new contracts represent the earned fee amount for the period 
the estimated remaining contractual life for real estate tax monitoring services and flood certification services can vary depending on a number of factors  including but not limited to  type of loan  lender  credit quality of the borrower  interest rates  and portfolio turnover 
the company evaluates the portfolio of loans under service quarterly to determine the appropriate portfolio life for loans under service 
an increase decrease of six months in the average service life for all loans serviced would result in the following approximate changes to revenue recognized for real estate tax and flood monitoring revenues revenue recognized increase of months million decrease of months million cyclicality and seasonality the title insurance business is closely related to the overall level of residential and commercial real estate activity  which is generally affected by the relative strength or weakness of the united states economy 
in addition  title insurance volumes fluctuate based on the effect that changes in interest rates have on the level of real estate activity 
periods of increasing interest rates usually have an adverse impact on real estate activity and therefore premium and fee revenues 
due to the historically low interest rates in the past three years  the company s results have not followed their typical seasonal patterns 
the company anticipates that its normal seasonality will return in future periods 
historically  residential real estate activity has been generally slower in the winter  when fewer families buy or sell homes  with increased volumes in the spring and summer 
residential refinancing activity is generally more uniform throughout the seasons  but is subject to interest rate variability 
the company s title insurance segment typically reports its lowest revenues in the first quarter  with revenues increasing into the second quarter and through the third quarter 
the fourth quarter customarily may be as strong as the third quarter  depending on the level of activity in the commercial real estate market 
due to historically low interest rates in the last three years  the company s results have not followed the typical seasonal patterns 
in  and the company s fourth quarter revenues were stronger than the third quarter primarily due to increased activity in the commercial real estate market each year and as a result of an increase in non title operations in and an increase in refinance activity in the residential real estate market in and the company s lender services segment has similar seasonal trending 
however  due to the nature of the revenue deferrals made in this segment  as noted above  the impact on the company s results of operations will differ 
in instances where the company receives cash in advance for services for real estate tax payment and flood certification services  the revenue is deferred and amortized ratably over the anticipated life of the loan servicing 
this ratable amortization has the impact of reducing the volatility in revenue related to this segment  however  loss of a customer may accelerate recognition of revenue in certain periods resulting in one time volatility 
for additional information  see item business cyclicality and seasonality 
results of operations operating revenues a summary of the company s operating revenues at december is as follows dollars in millions title insurance direct operations agency operations lender services financial services corporate and other total title insurance operating revenues from direct title operations increased percent in from the increase in was primarily related to acquisitions of title agents in the past two years including county title holding corporation southland in april and gateway title company in november and increased levels of commercial activity partially offset by a reduction in residential refinancing transactions 
all acquisitions by the company in this segment accounted for an increase in direct operations operating revenues of million for as compared to the reduction in refinancing transactions resulted in a decrease in the number of title policies issued by the company s direct operations in  as compared to  of percent  excluding acquisitions  that was partially offset by an increase in the fee per closed order 
the reduction in refinancing transactions caused a change in the mix toward fewer refinancing and more purchase title policies which have more revenue per policy associated with them 
orders closed by the company s direct title operations were  excluding acquisitions   and  during and  respectively 
the average fee per closed order  which includes title insurance premiums and other revenue related to transactions by direct operations  was  in versus  in the fluctuations noted in the number of policies issued and average fees per closed order were primarily attributable to the relative changes in mortgage activity year over year  as mentioned above  as well as an increase in commercial activity 
operating revenues from agency title operations decreased by percent in compared to this decrease was primarily attributable to the changes in refinancing activity that the company has experienced 
an additional factor is the timing in the reporting of transactions by agents 
the timing of policy reporting  and therefore revenue reporting by agents varies from year to year  from agent to agent and between regions of the country 
operating revenues from direct title operations increased percent for the year ended december  over the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to residential refinancing activity  the impact of acquisitions made in and increases in commercial real estate activity 
the number of title policies issued by the company s direct operations increased for compared to by percent  excluding acquisitions  while the average fee per closed order decreased from  per policy in to  in due to a change in mix toward more refinancing which have less revenue per policy associated with them 
policies issued by the company s direct title operations were  and  during and  respectively 
revenues from acquisitions in accounted for an increase of million for the year ended december  as compared to operating revenues from agency title operations increased by percent in over this increase was primarily attributable to the impact of increased residential refinancing activities 
as noted above  the timing of policy reporting  and therefore revenue reporting varies by agent 
the company anticipates that title insurance segment revenue will decrease in from levels due to expected lower refinance and home purchase activity resulting from anticipated higher interest rates 
lender services as a result of acquisitions  operating revenues in the lender services segment increased substantially in as compared to this increase was primarily driven by latf  purchased in october  and lacs  purchased in august latf revenue increased to million in from million in latf  the real estate tax processing and flood certification business  receives cash in advance for products that require it to provide service over the life of the loan 
in  the company s real estate tax processing and flood certification services revenue was made up of gross receipts of million  reduced by deferred recognition of revenue for million of these receipts and increased by the recognition into revenue of approximately million of its previously deferred service arrangements 
the deferred service arrangements represent the amount of revenue that will be recognized over the anticipated service life of contracts related to latf 
the service life of the company s portfolio  which is reviewed quarterly  has increased by percent compared to the expected service life increases with an increasing mortgage interest rate environment because loans tend to be outstanding longer in periods when interest rates increase 
this reduces the amount of deferred service arrangements that is amortized into revenue for each period on its life of loan products 
if interest rates vary from the current expected trend  the estimated service life will increase or decrease inversely to changes in interest rates 
lacs revenue increased to million in from million in due to the inclusion of a full year s operating revenue from the company s original acquisition in august and the acquisitions it made to this business in similarly  operating revenues increased substantially in lender services in over due to the above noted acquisitions 
in  the company s real estate tax processing and flood certification services businesses had gross receipts of million  decreased by the deferral of revenue recognition for million of these receipts and increased by of revenue recognition of its total deferred service arrangements 
lacs contributed million to lender services revenue in the company anticipates higher revenues in in the lender services segment due primarily to acquisitions 
financial services the increase in operating revenues between and and in compared to was caused by the acquisition of centennial bank in november corporate and other operating revenues in corporate and other increased by approximately million  or percent  between and primarily due to the recent acquisitions in the company s residential inspection  commercial appraisal and assessment and home warranty businesses 
the increase in revenue in over is due to increases in the residential inspection and commercial appraisal and assessment businesses of million as well as an increase of million related to an increase in the equity in unconsolidated subsidiaries  offset by a reduction in revenues of million related to the residential appraisal business that the company exited in the company anticipates that revenue in corporate and other will continue to increase in as a result of the acquisitions made in investment and other income investment and other income totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase of million  or percent  in compared to and the increase of million from to is primarily the result of the acquisition of centennial in december which resulted in increased interest income of million in and million in  respectively 
partially offsetting the increase in was a decrease in interest income related to lower yields on the company s remaining investment and cash equivalent portfolio 
the company s investment earnings are primarily derived from its fixed maturity securities as well as loans receivable related to centennial 
the company anticipates that investment and other income will increase in over due to higher loan balances and due to increased deposits of the company s escrow accounts at centennial 
net realized investment gains net realized investment gains totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the fluctuation in net realized investment gains is primarily due to the timing of the repositioning of a portion of the company s investments to fund  in part  the acquisitions of latf and lacs 
agents commissions a summary of agents commissions and related revenues in the title insurance segment is as follows dollars in millions agents commissions agent revenues retained by agents the commission rate paid to agents varies by geographic area in which the commission was paid and by individual agent agreement 
in early and throughout  the company experienced increasing commission rates attributable to increased competition for agents 
during the remainder of  the company experienced a moderation of such increases due to its acquisition of title agencies and expects commission rates for to be consistent with levels at the end of salaries and employee benefits a summary of the company s salaries and other personnel costs is as follows dollars in millions title insurance lender services financial services corporate and other total title insurance the company s title insurance segment accounted for approximately of the company s total salaries and other personnel costs in the title insurance segment  in particular non agency or direct operations  is labor intensive and as a result a significant variable expense component for this segment is salaries and other personnel costs 
the company manages personnel expenses to reflect changes in the level of activity in the real estate market 
as a result  the company s employee base expands and contracts over time 
in order to manage personnel costs more effectively throughout the real estate cycle  it uses temporary or part time employees where appropriate to staff operations so that it can respond promptly to changes in real estate activity 
before the impact of title company acquisitions  if any  the company anticipates that in the title insurance segment s portion of total personnel costs will decrease as a percentage of total personnel costs as the company continues to diversify its other businesses 
the company has been monitoring  and will continue to monitor  personnel levels in connection with changes in real estate transaction volumes 
depending on the rapidity of the change in real estate activity  the company may be unable in the short run to match decreasing levels of title orders with staffing levels 
as a result  in periods of declining activity  personnel costs as a percentage of revenue  may increase 
title insurance salaries and employee benefit costs increased by million  or  in from the increase in cost is due in large part to increased costs of million related to the addition of personnel as the result of and acquisitions offset by reduced staffing in other operations due to reduced volume levels 
additionally  there was a net increase of million in pension and postretirement benefit expenses 
for additional information regarding the impact of the company s pension plans on results of operations  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
average full time equivalent fte counts were  in including  associated with and acquisitions versus  in the company anticipates that these costs will decrease in as the result of the continuing impact of staff reductions related to anticipated reduced residential transaction volume levels as well as a reduction in pension expense associated with the cash balance plan of approximately million due to the company s restructuring of its retirement benefits 
title insurance salaries and employee benefit costs increased million  or  in over primarily related to compensation increases associated with the increase in business volumes and increased commission expense for internal sales personnel 
the company also had an increase in its pension expense of approximately million 
average full time equivalent fte counts for the year totaled  in versus  in additionally  the company had increased costs of approximately million related to acquisitions in lender services lender services salaries and employee benefit costs increased million  or in due to acquisitions made in and early lender services personnel costs tend to increase during periods of increased sales volume and decrease when sales volume is lower 
this is the case because a significant amount of work is required to set up new accounts 
once accounts are established  monitoring and maintenance activities are less labor intensive 
the company anticipates slightly higher salaries and employee benefit costs in due to the acquisitions made in financial services financial services salaries and benefit costs increased in over and in over due to the company s acquisition of centennial bank in december corporate and other corporate and other salaries and employee benefit costs increased million  or  in over approximately half of the increase  or million  was related to acquisitions with the remainder due to increases at the corporate level due to continued infrastructure growth and the compliance with the sarbanes oxley act 
corporate and other salaries and benefit costs increased million  or in over the increase in salaries and benefit costs in over relate to an increase in employees at the company s shared resources facility required due to growth in the company s infrastructure  primarily in the information technology area  an increase in incentive compensation as a result of the company s financial performance  as well as continued expansion of the company s other services an increase of million  offset by the termination of the business of primis  inc  the company s web based provider of real estate services  of million see additional information under exit and termination costs below 
the company anticipates that its costs in this group of businesses will increase in as the result of acquisitions made in provision for policy and contract claims the company reviews its claims experience quarterly  and in conjunction with its outside actuaries  evaluates the adequacy of its claims reserve 
the company considers factors such as historical timing of claims reported and historical timing of claims paid over the period in which policies are effective against actual experience by year of policy issue to determine the amount of claims liability required for each year for which policies are outstanding 
the company also considers the impact of current trends in marketplace activity  such as refinance activity  which may shorten the time period a policy is outstanding  bankruptcies  and individual large claims attributable to any particular period in determining the expected liability associated with each year 
throughout and during the latter portion of  claims associated with policies issued by the company between and appear to have a trend of being higher than the company s historical trends which resulted in the company increasing its reserves associated with those policy issue years 
this has been mitigated somewhat by decreased claim activity in policies issued during the s where claims made appear to be below historical rates  due in part  the company believes  to refinance activity in recent years which has resulted in the company reducing claims reserves 
since there is an extended time period for which the company is liable  slight changes in current claims experience can result in a significant impact in the amount of liability required for potential incurred but not reported ibnr claims

prbda  adjusted operating revenues and prbda margin as defined above may not be similar to other prbda measures of other companies  are not measurements under accounting principles accepted in the united states and should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for  the information contained in the company s statement of operations 
the company believes that adjusted operating revenues  prbda and prbda margins provide useful information to investors because they are indicators of the strength and cash flow generating performance of those businesses where we have life of loan servicing requirements  and that have been burdened in the short run with amortization expense related to intangibles acquired with the businesses 
while amortization expense is considered an operating expense under generally accepted accounting principles  these expenses represent the non current allocation of intangible assets acquired in prior periods 
additionally  while deferred revenue represents a reduction of revenue and profits in the current period  these reductions represent a non cash allocation of revenue to future periods for on going monitoring of certain of the company s flood and tax servicing products

while the company has continued to diversify its products and services portfolio over the last several years  a significant downturn in the real estate market would adversely impact the company s cash flows 
the company s business is labor intensive and changes to the real estate market are monitored closely and staffing levels are adjusted accordingly 
there is typically a lag between changes in the real estate market and changes in personnel levels resulting in higher personnel costs in periods where the real estate market declines in advance of headcount reductions 
the lender services segment provides real estate tax payment and flood certification services for the life of loans for which it receives cash at loan closing 
this revenue related to the long term servicing is deferred and amortized over the life of the loan 
as a result  the company s cash flows in the lender services segment are significantly greater than reported earnings 
revenues  cash receipts and loans in the company s financial services segment are dependent on the ability of the bank to attract deposits and qualified commercial customers

the company does not match maturities of its investments with anticipated claims payments  which may result in the company having periods in which cash flows from operations are positively or negatively impacted by the difference between the liability for claims being established and the actual payment stream 
as opposed to insurance companies where claims account for a substantial portion of premiums  the company s title insurance claims typically average approximately to of gross title insurance revenue 
additionally  the time period in which the company is liable for a claim is long  with potential claims being paid over years after a title policy is issued

the company considers its investment portfolio as available for sale 
the company reviews the status of each security quarterly to determine whether an other than temporary impairment otti has occurred 
the company s criteria include whether the fair value of the security is less than of its amortized cost  the investment grade of the security and how long the security has been in an unrealized loss position 
all of the company s securities that have had an unrealized loss in excess of year are investment grade  long term bonds that the company has the ability and intent to hold to maturity 
consequently  the company recorded no otti loss in or during  the company completed acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of approximately million

the company will continue to selectively evaluate additional acquisitions should attractive candidates be identified

in addition  the company and its representatives may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements  including statements contained in other filings with the securities and exchange commission and in its reports to shareholders 
these forward looking statements are generally identified by the use of words such as we expect  believe  anticipate  estimate or words of similar import 
these forward looking statements are based upon management s current knowledge and assumptions about future events and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s actual results  performance or achievements to be materially different from any anticipated results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
further  any such statement is specifically qualified in its entirety by the cautionary statements set forth in the following paragraphs 
factors that may cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward looking statements include the following the company s results of operations and financial condition are susceptible to changes in mortgage interest rates and general economic conditions 
the demand for the company s title insurance and other real estate transaction products and services is dependent upon  among other things  the volume of commercial and residential real estate transactions  including mortgage refinancing transactions 
the volume of these transactions has historically been influenced by factors such as interest rates and the state of the overall economy 
for example  when interest rates are increasing or during an economic downturn or recession  real estate activity typically declines and the company tends to experience lower revenues and profitability 
the cyclical nature of the company s business has caused fluctuations in revenues and profitability in the past and is expected to do so in the future 
in addition  changes in interest rates may have an adverse impact on the company s return on invested cash  the market value of its investment portfolio and interest paid on its bank debt 
the company s operating revenues for the year ended december  increased by over the prior year  primarily due to a favorable residential mortgage interest rate environment and a large volume of mortgage refinancing transactions 
however  except during brief periods in  mortgage interest rates generally have risen  beginning in the third quarter of  and the company has experienced a decline in refinancing transactions since that time 
for fiscal year  the company expects that the level of refinancing transactions will be substantially below the levels experienced in recent years 
the company began the implementation of a cost reduction program in the fourth quarter of aimed at reducing staffing and cost levels to a level more consistent with anticipated transaction volumes 
in the first quarter of  the company announced plans to reduce its cost structure by at least million on an annualized basis 
the company has implemented reductions to achieve at least the targeted cost savings 
operating results for the company s and fiscal years  including interim periods  should not be viewed as indicative of results for or any future period 
the company s inability to manage successfully its acquisitions of complementary businesses could adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
an element of the company s business strategy is to expand the services it provides through acquisitions of complementary businesses 
during and  the company acquired several companies outside of its traditional business operations  including latf  lacs  centennial  bhw and loancare  previously described above 
the businesses of latf  lacs  centennial and loancare are different from each other and from the business of providing title insurance and related services 
the company also may in the future acquire other businesses outside of its traditional business operations  although no assurances can be given that the company will do so or that it will continue to acquire such companies at the levels previously experienced 
such acquisitions involve a number of special risks  including the company s inexperience in managing businesses that provide products and services beyond its traditional business  new regulatory requirements  diversion of management s attention  failure to retain key acquired personnel  failure to effectively integrate operations  company cultures and services  increased costs to improve managerial  operational  financial and administrative systems  legal liabilities  and amortization of acquired intangible assets 
in addition  there can be no assurance that acquired businesses will achieve anticipated levels of revenues  earnings or performance 
the failure of the company to manage its acquisitions successfully could materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
competition in the company s industry affects its revenues 
the business of providing real estate transaction products and services is very competitive 
competition for residential title insurance business is based primarily on price and quality of service 
with respect to national and regional mortgage lenders  service quality includes a large distribution network and the ability to deliver a broad array of real estate services quickly  efficiently and through a single point of contact 
competition for commercial title business is based primarily on price  service  expertise in complex transactions and the size and financial strength of the insurer 
title insurance underwriters also compete for agents on the basis of service and commission levels 
although the company is one of the largest providers of real estate transaction products and services in the united states  four other companies fidelity national financial  inc  the first american corporation  old republic international corporation and stewart information services  inc have the size  capital base and agency networks to compete effectively with the company s products and services 
in addition  some of the company s competitors may have  or will have in the future  greater capital and other resources than the company 
competition among the major providers of real estate transaction products and services and any new entrants could adversely affect the company s revenues and profitability 
significant industry changes and new product and service introductions require timely and cost effective responses 
as a national provider of real estate transaction products and services  the company participates in an industry that is subject to significant change  frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards 
in addition  alternatives to traditional title insurance  such as lien protection products  have emerged in recent years 
the company believes that its future success will depend on its ability to anticipate changes in technology and customer preferences and to offer products and services that meet evolving standards on a timely and cost effective basis 
the development and implementation of new products and services may require significant capital expenditures and other resources 
there is a risk that customers may not accept the company s new product and service offerings and the company may not successfully identify new product and service opportunities nor develop and introduce new products and services in a timely and cost effective manner 
in addition  products and services that the company s competitors and other real estate industry participants develop or introduce may render certain of the company s products and services obsolete or noncompetitive 
advances in technology could also reduce the useful lives of the company s products  preventing the company from recovering fully its investment in particular products and services 
as a result  the inability of the company to anticipate industry changes and to respond with competitive and profitable products and services may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
the company may not succeed in implementing its strategy of becoming a major provider of real estate transaction management services 
one of the company s business strategies is to expand its capabilities to manage the delivery of multiple services required in real estate transactions through a centralized source  and to significantly grow the volume of transactions that it manages 
there is a risk that the company s transaction management services may fail to gain market acceptance  particularly from the large national mortgage originators 
furthermore  there are relatively low barriers to entry into the market for real estate transaction management  as opposed to the regulated title insurance business  which may result in a large number of competitors  including large national mortgage originators and others having substantially greater financial resources 
the company s insurance and banking subsidiaries are subject to government regulation 
the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the state insurance authorities of the various states in which they transact business 
these regulations are generally intended for the protection of policyholders rather than security holders 
the nature and extent of these regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction  but typically involve regulation of dividend payments and other transactions between affiliates  prior approval of the acquisition and control of an insurance company or of any company controlling an insurance company  regulation of certain transactions entered into by an insurance company with any of its affiliates  approval of premium rates for insurance  standards of solvency and minimum amounts of capital surplus that must be maintained  limitations on types and amounts of investments  restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured by a single company  licensing of insurers and agents  deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders  approval of policy forms  methods of accounting  establishing reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  regulation of underwriting and marketing practices  regulation of reinsurance  and filing of annual and other reports with respect to financial condition and other matters 
these regulations may impede  or impose burdensome conditions on  rate increases or other actions that the company might want to take to enhance its operating results 
in addition  state regulatory examiners perform periodic examinations of insurance companies 
the company is and has in the past been subject to information requests and subpoenas from the states relating to investigations of the business practices of the company and the title industry 
multiple states are specifically investigating captive reinsurance 
any restrictions imposed or actions taken by states with respect to the company or the title insurance industry in general arising out of such information requests or subpoenas may adversely affect the company s business  financial position or results of operations 
centennial is subject to regulation and supervision by the federal reserve bank  the federal deposit insurance corporation and the california department of financial institutions 
banking regulations are intended primarily to protect depositors and the federal deposit insurance funds and not stockholders 
regulatory requirements affect  among other things  the company s banking subsidiaries practices  capital level  investment practices  dividend policies and growth 
the company s litigation risks include substantial claims by large classes of claimants 
from time to time the company is involved in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business
