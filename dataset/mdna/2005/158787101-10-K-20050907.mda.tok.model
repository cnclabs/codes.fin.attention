item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
our franchisees could take actions that could harm our business franchisees are independent operators and are not employed by us 
we provide training and support to franchisees  but any number of factors beyond our control may diminish the quality of franchised restaurant operations 
consequently  franchisees may not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements or may not hire and train qualified managers and other restaurant personnel 
if franchisees do not operate in accordance with our standards  our image and reputation may suffer materially and system wide sales could significantly decline 
also  the presence of franchised restaurants may limit our ability to expand in a desired market 
our operations are susceptible to changes in food availability and costs  which could adversely affect our operating results our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food costs 
we rely on sysco corporation  a national distributor  as the primary supplier of our food 
any increase in distribution prices or failure of sysco to perform could cause our food costs to increase 
there also could be a significant short term disruption in our supply chain if sysco failed to meet our distribution requirements or our relationship was terminated 
further  various factors beyond our control  including adverse weather conditions  governmental regulation  production  availability and seasonality may affect our food costs or cause a disruption in our supply 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices  and a failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
changes in consumer preferences or discretionary consumer spending could negatively impact our results of operations our continued success depends  in part  upon the popularity of the menu items served in the champps environment and our dining style 
shifts in consumer preferences away from our cuisine or dining style could materially and adversely affect our future profitability 
in addition  our success depends to a significant extent on numerous factors affecting discretionary consumer spending  including economic conditions  disposable consumer income and consumer confidence 
adverse changes in these factors could reduce guest traffic or impose practical limits on pricing  either of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

table of contents health concerns relating to the consumption of our food products could negatively impact our results of operations we are subject to the risk that consumer preferences could be affected by health concerns about the consumption of particular food products 
beef and chicken are the key ingredients in many of our menu items 
negative publicity concerning food quality  illness and injury  publication of government or industry findings concerning food products served by us  or other dietary and health concerns or operating issues stemming from one restaurant or a limited number of restaurants may adversely affect demand for our food and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants 
increases in utility  insurance or other costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations our restaurants operating margins are affected by fluctuations in the price of utilities such as natural gas  electricity and water 
the premiums that we pay for our insurance programs  including workers compensation  general liability  health and directors and officers liability  may increase at any time as may the amount we pay for claims experienced under our high deductible programs 
also  our restaurants incur a number of other costs in order to operate not limited to supplies  services  banking credit card fee and repair and maintenance costs 
all of such costs may increase at any time and negatively affect our operating margins 
we depend on the services of key executives and management  the loss of whom could materially harm our business our future success significantly depends on the continued service and performance of our executive officers and key associates  such as regional directors of operation  restaurant general managers and kitchen managers 
competition for these key associates is intense 
the loss of the services of members of our senior management and key associates or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed could adversely harm our business until suitable replacements can be found 
litigation or assessments could have a material adverse affect on our business we are subject to complaints or allegations from current and former or prospective associates from time to time 
in addition  we are subject to complaints or litigation from guests alleging discrimination  illness  injury or other food quality  health or operational concerns 
we may be adversely affected by publicity resulting from such allegations  regardless of whether such allegations are valid  whether we are liable  or whether such allegations involve one of our franchisees or licensees 
a lawsuit or claim could result in an adverse decision or result that could have a material adverse affect on our business 
we are also subject to state dram shop laws and regulations  which generally provide that a person injured by an intoxicated person may seek to recover damages from an establishment that illegally over served alcohol to such person 
while we carry liquor liability coverage as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance  we may still be subject to a judgment in excess of our insurance coverage and we may not be able to obtain or continue to maintain such insurance coverage at reasonable costs  or at all 

table of contents in connection with the spin off of daka in late  we assumed certain contingent liabilities of daka and its subsidiary  daka  inc daka 
under our post closing covenant agreement with daka  we are responsible for certain resulting liabilities and handling the defense of these claims  including the appeals  which have previously been significant 
from time to time  the company and its predecessors have been party to various assessments of taxes  penalties and interest from federal  state and local agencies 
we provide reserves in our financial statements for these and other matters 
the approximate amounts of these reserves are reviewed periodically to determine their adequacy 
although we believe that our current reserves are adequate in light of our analyses of the potential outcomes of the matters  there can be no guarantees that we will not have to recognize additional charges as these matters are ultimately resolved 
any resulting charges could be significant 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  it could reduce our ability to capitalize on our brand names pursuant to a master agreement dated february   we acquired the champps  champ s and champps americana service marks  trademarks and trade names 
our business prospects depend  in part  on our ability to develop favorable consumer recognition of the champps name and logo 
our trademarks could be infringed in ways that leave us without redress  such as by imitation 
in addition  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how  and we employ various methods to protect our concepts and recipes 
however  such methods may not afford adequate protection and others could independently develop similar know how or obtain access to our know how  concepts and recipes 
moreover  we may face claims of infringement that could both interfere with our use of our proprietary know how  concepts  recipes  trade secrets or trademarks or subject us to damages 
defending against such claims may be costly and  if unsuccessful  may prevent us from continuing to use such proprietary information in the future 
although champps  champ s and champps americana are federally registered trademarks  there are other restaurants and bars that operate under similar names 
if these restaurants or bars are affected by negative publicity and consumers confuse these competitors with our champps branded restaurants  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we are subject to extensive governmental regulations including  but not limited to  the sale and serving of alcoholic beverages and wages paid to our associates that could adversely affect our operations and our ability to expand and develop our restaurants the restaurant industry is subject to various federal  state and local governmental regulations 
while at this time we have been able to obtain and maintain the necessary governmental licenses  permits and approvals  the failure to maintain these licenses  permits and approvals  including food and liquor licenses  could adversely affect our operating results 
difficulties or failure in obtaining the required licenses and approvals could delay or result in our decision to cancel the opening of new restaurants 
local authorities may suspend  revoke or deny renewal of our food and liquor licenses if they determine that our conduct or facilities do not meet applicable standards or if there are changes in regulations 
smoking bans in some locations could also have an adverse effect on our business 
for fiscal  approximately of our restaurant food and beverage sales was attributable to the sale of alcoholic beverages  and we believe our ability to serve these beverages is an important factor in attracting guests 
alcoholic beverage control regulations require each of our restaurants to apply to a state authority and  in certain locations  county or municipal authorities for a license or permit to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises and to provide service for extended hours and on sundays 

table of contents typically  licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time  which could include sales to minors or intoxicated persons 
alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of daily operations of our restaurants 
the failure of a restaurant to obtain or retain liquor or food service licenses would adversely affect the restaurant s operations 
various federal and state labor laws govern our relationship with our associates and affect our operating costs 
these laws include minimum wage requirements  overtime pay  unemployment tax rates  workers compensation rates  and citizenship requirements 
additional government imposed increases in minimum wages  overtime pay  paid leave of absence and mandated health benefits  increased tax reporting and tax payment requirements for associates who receive gratuities or a reduction in the number of states that allow tips to be credited toward minimum wage requirements could harm our operating results 
we are also subject to the ada which may increase the cost of construction or remodeling 
on june   the united states supreme court ruled that the internal revenue service irs can use aggregate tip estimates to ensure that the employer is paying fica taxes on allegedly underreported tips 
under the ruling  the irs does not need to examine individual associates records and it is permissible for the irs to estimate the amount of cash tips given to associates based on tips included on credit card receipts 
the reporting of tips is the responsibility of the associates receiving the tips 
we encourage and train our associates to abide by the law and report of the tips that they receive 
while we believe our associates adequately report tips  we have implemented tip reporting policies and procedures that are in full compliance with the recommended irs policies and procedures as defined in our tip reporting alternative commitment agreement that was executed by the company and the irs in fiscal we may not be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to fully utilize our income tax operating loss and credit carryforwards as of july   we had federal net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately million and fica tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
the federal nol s expire at various times through and the fica tip tax credits expire at various times through also as of july   we had certain state net operating loss carryforwards totaling million expiring at various dates through while we expect to fully utilize all of the federal carryforwards and almost all of the state carryforwards to reduce our income tax liabilities  future income may not be sufficient for full utilization of the carryforwards 
our financial results are subject to fluctuations due to the seasonal nature of our business our sales fluctuate seasonally and therefore our quarterly results are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 
for fiscal years and  our relative sales were highest in our second quarter october through december  followed by our third quarter january through march  then by our fourth quarter april through june 
our first quarter july through september recorded the lowest relative sales for those years 
factors influencing sales variability in addition to those noted above include the frequency and popularity  or lack thereof  of sporting events  holidays including which day of the week the holiday occurs and weather 

table of contents we may be locked into long term and non cancelable leases that we want to cancel  and may be unable to renew leases that we want to extend at the end of their terms most of our current leases are non cancelable and typically have terms ranging from to years and renewal options for terms ranging from five to years 
leases that we enter into in the future likely will also be long term and non cancelable and have similar renewal options 
while we have yet to do so  if we close a restaurant  we may remain committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease  which would include  among other things  payment of rent for the balance of the lease term 
additionally  the potential losses associated with our inability to cancel leases may result in our keeping open restaurant locations that are performing significantly below targeted levels 
as a result  ongoing operations at underperforming restaurant locations could impair our results of operations 
in addition  at the end of the lease term and any renewal period for a restaurant  we may be unable to renew the lease without substantial additional cost  if at all 
as a result  we may be required to close or relocate a restaurant  which could subject us to construction and other costs and risks  and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we may not be able to repay or refinance our indebtedness our long term debt is principally comprised of a million face value issuance of convertible notes due december the notes are convertible at the option of the holder at any time prior to maturity into shares of our common stock  at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment upon certain events 
at any time on or after december   we may redeem some or all of the notes at par plus accrued and unpaid interest 
all of the notes can be converted  at our option  into shares of common stock at the then effective conversion price if the closing price of the common stock exceeds of the then effective conversion price for any out of consecutive trading days at any time before december there are no assurances that the convertible debt holders will convert their debt into shares prior to december  nor are there any assurances that the stock price will rise  allowing us to convert the debt 
if the debt is not converted it may be necessary for us to seek additional financing when this debt matures 
if we seek additional financing there are no assurances that we will be able to do so at that time  and the terms of the debt may not be as favorable as our existing debt 
our failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we are required  beginning with this annual report on form k  to perform an evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting and to have our registered independent accounting firm attest to such evaluation 
we have devoted significant resources to document  test  monitor and improve our internal controls and will continue to do so in the future  however  we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that our internal controls will be adequate in the future 
if we fail to timely complete our future internal controls evaluations  or if our registered independent accounting firm cannot timely attest to our evaluation  we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in our internal controls 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud  which would have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cause us to fail to satisfy our public reporting requirements 

table of contents if certain of our restaurants fail to perform to a level sufficient to cover their asset value  we may be forced if incur further write downs of our assets  which could negatively impact our financial performance based on our evaluation of the estimated fair values of impaired assets of four of our underperforming restaurants  we recorded an impairment charge of million during our third quarter ended april  during the quarter ended april   three additional restaurants located in irvine  california  skokie  illinois and richmond  virginia were also reviewed for impairment 
at this time  we have not recorded an impairment charge related to these restaurants because management believes certain changes can be made to improve the future prospects of those restaurants 
we determined that each of these restaurants has the opportunity to improve their cash flows to a level sufficient to cover their asset value once external factors impacting their sales are properly addressed 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not experience circumstances in the future that require us to write down additional assets of these or other restaurants

the balance sheet data as of july   june   june   june  and july  and the statements of operations data for each of the five fiscal years in the period ended july  presented below are derived from our audited consolidated financial statements 
certain amounts have been reclassified for earlier periods to conform to the fiscal presentation

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview we are a restaurant company competing in the upscale casual dining market 
as of july   we owned and operated and franchised restaurants under one of the following names champps americana  champps restaurant or champps restaurant and bar 
we operate and franchise restaurants in states with larger concentrations of restaurants in the upper midwest  mid atlantic and texas 
champps menu consists of high quality ingredients  freshly prepared and served with exceptional service in an exciting environment through the use of videos  music  sports and promotions 
our restaurants generally are open seven days a week from am to am we serve our guests in the dining room and bar area during lunch  after work  during dinner and after dinner during our late night period 
the first champps opened in at june  we owned restaurants 
in fiscal years through  we opened or acquired restaurants 
we opened seven restaurants in each of our fiscal years and in fiscal  we opened four additional locations 
we expect to only open two to four new company operated restaurants in fiscal we purposely slowed our growth in fiscal and expect to have only the indicated modest growth in as we undertake certain initiatives outlined below aimed at improving our existing operations and redefining our growth plans and site selection criteria 
our current restaurants range in size from approximately  square feet to  square feet  with an average of about  square feet 
we have built smaller restaurants over the last three years averaging approximately  square feet 
also  we are in the process of developing a smaller prototype of approximately  to  square feet 
this smaller prototype should provide us a greater opportunity to construct additional restaurants because of the greater number of site options for this size restaurant 
in addition  we should be able to improve on our economic model as the cost to build these smaller restaurants will be lower than our existing prototype 
pre opening expenses have historically averaged approximately  per restaurant 
historically  our primary sources of liquidity for funding our operations and expansion have been cash provided from operations  and standard restaurant financing methods  such as build to suit transactions  sale leaseback transactions  mortgage facilities  notes payable  tenant improvement allowances and equipment financing 
also  in we issued million of convertible subordinated notes and warrants and in we secured a three year million revolving bank credit facility giving us greater financial flexibility and future interest expense savings 
in that regard  certain of our higher interest rate notes payable and capital leases as well as certain operating leases were repaid in fiscal with excess cash and use of this bank facility  although we were subject to prepayment penalties and a write off of related debt issuance costs 
in fiscal  we prepaid an additional million of debt which was not subject to any prepayment penalties and repaid all of our outstanding advances under our bank credit facility 

table of contents an important indicator of performance within the restaurant industry is comparable sales or same store sales 
this indicator compares the revenue performance of our restaurants open for more than full months to the same restaurants in the prior year thereby eliminating the impact of new openings in comparing the operations of existing stores 
small changes in comparable sales can have a proportionally higher impact on operating margins because of the high degree of fixed costs associated with operating restaurants 
our comparable sales trends have been negative for four consecutive quarters after being modestly positive the prior fiscal year 
we believe that certain economic and other external factors as discussed below may have contributed to the lower sales  as well as site selection and other operational factors 
however  we believe the weakness in sales is not solely attributed to such external factors 
our sales are somewhat dependent upon the timing and viewing of professional and college sporting events such as football  basketball and hockey  and to a lesser extent baseball 
work stoppages or lockouts of a professional league can have an adverse impact on our sales 
the national hockey league nhl was in a lockout during its season 
we believe our annual sales were impacted between to percent as the result of the cancellation of the nhl season 
this equates to an annual sales loss of between to million 
our average weekly sales per restaurant have also been decreasing over the last several years as our new stores have lower average weekly sales than our existing stores due in part to their reduced size 
however  the average sales per square foot for our newer stores have been substantially lower than those of our more established locations 
we believe this is due largely to certain underperforming sites selected over the past several years 
we are in the process of implementing a new site selection process which will incorporate an improved analytical evaluation which we believe will lead to more attractive restaurant results 
one of the other key factors we use in evaluating and understanding our restaurants and assessing our business is our store operating margins 
we define our store operating margin as restaurant sales less restaurant level operating costs product costs  labor costs  other operating expenses and occupancy 
we review store operating margins both in hard dollar terms and as a percentage of restaurant sales 
although we have been successful in lowering our product costs and labor costs over the past three years  other operating expenses and occupancy have increased as a percent of restaurant sales primarily due to the fixed expense nature of these costs versus lower average unit sales volumes for our restaurants 
inflation coupled with negative comparable sales has also contributed to the percentage of sales decrease in operating margin 
on march   michael p 
o donnell was appointed our new chief executive officer  president and chairman of the board 
mr 
o donnell has identified key strategic initiatives in an effort to improve these negative trends in our comparable sales and improve our long term profitability 
the initiatives consist of streamlining our menu and adding improved value to price items to our offerings 
our goal is to reduce approximately percent of the items on the current menu and renew the focus on introducing popular menu items favored by our customers 
the new menu should allow for better execution  increased quality of our items and ultimately  greater guest satisfaction 
menu items are being tested in three of our locations and will be rolled out across the country throughout fiscal 
table of contents recertifying and training at every level of our organization 
this continuous improvement effort is aimed at improving our systems and developing our people and culture while creating a heightened awareness of champps mission of offering exceptional food and service to our customers 
we have completed our first wave of training with our regional directors and restaurant general managers and expect the remainder of the retraining to be completed during the first half of increasing customer traffic in our bars 
our goal is to attract new customers to our bars by improving service levels  ingredient quality and drink presentation 
we hope to reverse the trend of alcohol sales decreasing as an overall percentage of revenues by year end implementing a more aggressive and performance based bonus plan for our restaurant management 
we intend to provide our restaurant managers greater performance based compensation and an increased sense of ownership through this program 
targets will be related to operating cash flows 
we implemented an early version of this plan at the start of fiscal the final plan is expected to be rolled out no later than the end of fiscal improving our site selection process 
we are upgrading our site selection process to include more rigorous evaluation of the success factors for new site development 
we are currently testing a multi factor software model aimed at testing potential business locations outside of the mall based locations traditionally used by the company 
longer term  this model will also be critical in helping us develop a smaller prototype restaurant currently under consideration  but not yet contemplated for rollout in fiscal develop a franchise network to extend future growth opportunities 
we expect to hire a senior franchise development executive during the first half of fiscal year and begin the planning for a robust franchise network by year end 
we believe franchise development will only become an integral part of champps long term growth strategy once each of the above objectives is completed and the negative trends in same store sales are reversed 
although some of the initiatives can be implemented relatively quickly  such as a new bonus plan  others may take longer to implement  such as the rolling out of a new menu and developing a franchise network 
ultimately management believes the implementation of these initiatives will improve the profitability of the company 
however  we may incur additional expenses and capital spending in the near term to achieve our long term objectives 
in march  michael p 
o donnell entered into an employment agreement with us 
as part of the agreement   restricted shares of common stock are to be awarded to mr 
o donnell 
this award is subject to the availability of shares that have been authorized and are available under our stock option and incentive plans 
the company plans to seek shareholder approval that would permit the issuance of any shares not granted due to their lack of availability 
if the shareholders of the company fail to approve such resolution by the date any portion of the grants would otherwise have vested  the company is required to make a cash payment to mr 
o donnell equal to the economic value of the vesting shares 
 shares of the restricted stock award vest on an equal annual basis over a three year period 
 shares of the restricted stock award vest on the seventh anniversary of the grant date or earlier based upon the achievement of certain stock performance criteria 
as a result of this agreement  we have incurred additional compensation expense and a corresponding liability 

table of contents our results  and the results of the restaurant industry as a whole  may be adversely affected by changes in consumer tastes  discretionary spending priorities  national  regional and local economic conditions  demographic trends  consumer confidence in the economy  traffic patterns  weather conditions  employee availability  state and federal minimum wage requirements and the type  number and location of competing restaurants 
the timing of revenues and expenses associated with opening new restaurants is expected also to result in fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results 
changes in any of these factors could adversely affect us and our financial results 
in the last fiscal year  three of our restaurants operations were negatively impacted by local ordinances prohibiting smoking in public places  bringing the total stores affected by smoking bans to five restaurants in the past two years 
these smoking bans are becoming more prevalent at both state and local levels 
state mandated smoking bans have not historically impacted our operations while locality specific bans have negatively affected our operations due to the ability of smoking patrons to choose smoking venues in other nearby localities that do not have a smoking ban 
the success of our business and our operating results are also dependent upon our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food  liquor  labor and other costs and the mix between food and liquor revenues 
various factors beyond our control  such as adverse weather conditions  may affect food costs and increases in federal  state and local taxes may affect liquor costs 
while we have been able to manage our exposure to the risk of increasing food and liquor costs in the past through certain purchasing practices  menu changes and price adjustments  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future or that changes in our sales mix or our overall buying power will not adversely affect our results of operations 
minimum wage increases have occurred this fiscal year in several states where we operate and several states have approved increases to take effect in our next fiscal year 
while most of our kitchen staff are paid in excess of minimum wage levels and would not be affected by the increases  our server and bar staff are generally paid the tipped minimum wage and we generally must pay a higher hourly wage to those individuals as a result of the state mandated minimum wage increases 
we were responsible for a significant loss contingency related to a predecessor company see note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
we believe this contingency has been finally resolved 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded an asset impairment charge of million to write down to fair value the carrying value of assets for four underperforming locations 
we previously restated our financials for fiscal and prior due to certain error corrections related to lease accounting and leasehold asset depreciation 
all amounts in this annual report on form k reflect the restated amounts 
our financial results for the fiscal year ended july  included growth of consolidated revenues by to million reflective of the extra operating week in fiscal  full year inclusion of seven restaurants opened in fiscal and the partial year sales of four restaurants opened in fiscal a loss before income taxes of million was recorded in fiscal compared to income before income taxes of million in the prior fiscal year 
included in fiscal s results was an asset impairment charge of million 
a net loss of million  or diluted loss per share  was reported in fiscal compared to net income of million  or diluted income per share  in fiscal for fiscal  operating cash flow totaled million and outstanding debt balances were reduced by million 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
the estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an on going basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed by us to be reasonable under the circumstances 
items significantly impacted by estimates and judgments include  but are not limited to  representations  warranties and indemnities provided in connection with the spin off of daka in and the subsequent sale of the fuddruckers business unit in  self insured risks relating to workers compensation and general liability claims and legal liabilities  the useful lives and recoverability of our long lived assets such as property  equipment and intangibles  fair value attributed to assets and liabilities of acquired businesses  valuation of deferred tax assets and the recording of income tax expense 
loss contingencies and self insurance reserves we maintain accrued liabilities and reserves relating to the resolution of certain contingent obligations and reserves for self insurance 
significant contingencies may include those related to litigation and state tax assessments 
we account for contingent obligations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  as interpreted by fasb interpretation no 
which requires that we assess each contingency to determine estimates of the degree of probability and range of possible settlement 
contingencies which are deemed to be probable and where the amount of such settlement is reasonably estimable are accrued in our financial statements 
if only a range of loss can be determined  we accrue to the best estimate within that range  if none of the estimates within that range is better than another  we accrue to the low end of the range 
we are self insured for a significant portion of our employee health benefits  workers compensation and general liability programs 
however  we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our individual claim and total exposures under those programs 
we estimate our accrued liability for the ultimate costs to close known claims  including claims incurred but not yet reported to us as of the balance sheet date 
our recorded estimated liability for self insurance is based on the insurance companies incurred loss estimates and management s judgment  including assumptions and factors related to the frequency and severity of claims  our claims development history and our claims settlement practice 
the assessment of loss contingencies and self insurance reserves is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events 
contingencies are reviewed at least quarterly to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related financial statement disclosure 
the ultimate settlement of loss contingencies and self insurance reserves may differ significantly from amounts we have accrued in our financial statements 
useful lives of property and equipment land  buildings  leasehold improvements and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation 
these assets are depreciated using the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the shorter of their useful life or reasonably assured lease term for leasehold improvements 
these estimates may produce materially different amounts of reported depreciation and amortization expense if different assumptions were used 
as discussed further below  these judgments may also impact our need to recognize an impairment charge on the carrying amount of these assets as the cash flows associated with the assets are realized 

table of contents valuation of long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets including property  equipment and related identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
under sfas no 
 an assessment is made to determine if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows from the use of the assets and eventual disposition is less than the carrying value 
if the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized based on fair value 
we separately evaluate each individual restaurant for impairment 
generally  a restaurant is not evaluated for impairment until it has been open a full six quarters as the initial two quarters of operations are generally characterized by operating inefficiencies associated with start up operations 
however  we may review a restaurant sooner for impairment if it is operating significantly below our expectations 
we consider four consecutive quarters of negative cash flow or losses to be an indication that an individual restaurant may be impaired 
in evaluating whether an impairment charge is appropriate  we estimate the future cash flows for such potentially impaired restaurants utilizing such factors as restaurant sales trends  local conditions  demographics and competition  management plans and initiatives and other factors deemed appropriate in the circumstances 
during fiscal  we recorded a million asset impairment charge covering four restaurants 
additionally  we had another three restaurants open for at least six quarters which had positive cash flow over the last fiscal year  but the level of such cash flows were not high enough to sufficiently cover the restaurants long term asset values if such cash flows continue for the remainder of the restaurants lives 
however  we have not recorded an impairment charge at this time for these restaurants because management believes certain plans can be implemented to improve the future prospects of those restaurants 
we determined that each of these restaurants has the opportunity to improve their cash flows to a level sufficient to cover their asset value once external factors impacting their sales are properly addressed 
our forward looking judgments and estimates concerning the above mentioned restaurants may not materialize 
if such cash flows associated with any of these restaurants do not sufficiently improve  we would record an asset impairment charge for all or a portion of the respective restaurant s long lived assets depending on the fair value assigned to such assets 
as of july   the long lived assets value on these three restaurants totaled million 
we evaluate impairment of goodwill and other unidentifiable intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 we are required to assess impairment at least annually by means of a fair value based test 
at july   we evaluated our goodwill and determined that the goodwill was not impaired 
the determination of fair value requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates related to our business and is highly subjective  and accordingly  actual amounts realized may differ significantly from our estimate 

table of contents leases we lease most of our properties including our corporate office 
we account for our leases under the provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
 both entitled accounting for leases  as well as other subsequent amendments and authoritative literature 
to classify the lease as either an operating or a capital lease we use the non cancelable term of the lease if there is no penalty to cancel the lease at the conclusion of the non cancelable period 
if a penalty exists  we use the non cancelable period plus option s in determining the term to use when classifying the lease 
a penalty is deemed to occur if we would forego an economic benefit  or suffer an economic detriment by not renewing the lease 
this penalty can either be a part of the lease or can arise from the retirement of an asset with value 
this same lease term is used to calculate straight line rent and in calculating depreciation expense for our leasehold improvements 
we record the total rent payable during the lease term on a straight line basis over the term of the lease and record the difference between the rent paid and the straight line rent as a deferred rent liability 
lease incentive payments tenant improvement allowances received from landlords are recorded as deferred rent liabilities and are amortized on a straight line basis over the lease term as a reduction in rent 
future authoritative changes to the methods of accounting for leases could have a material impact on the company s reported results of operations and financial position 
valuation of deferred tax assets we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the carrying value for financial reporting purposes and the tax basis of assets and liabilities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which such differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities  resulting from a change in tax rates  is recognized as a component of income tax expense benefit in the period that such change occurs 
net operating loss and other credit carryforwards  including fica tip tax credits  are recorded as deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is recorded for the tax benefit of the deferred tax assets not expected to be utilized based on projected future taxable income  feasible tax planning strategies and the reversal of temporary differences 
as of july   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
as a result of our improved profitability in recent years and our estimates of projected future taxable income  we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize these net deferred tax assets 
as of july   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  expiring at various dates through  certain states net operating loss carryforwords totaling million expiring at various dates through and fica tip credit carryforwards of approximately million  expiring at various dates through income tax provision certain components of our provision for income taxes are estimated 
these estimates include  among other items  effective rates for local and state taxes  allowable tax credits for items such as fica taxes paid on reported tip income  estimates related to depreciation and amortization allowable for tax purposes  and the tax deductibility of certain other items 
our estimates are based on the best available information at the time that we prepare the provision 
we generally file our annual income tax returns many months after our fiscal year end 
income tax returns are subject to audit by federal  state and local governments  generally years after the returns are filed 
these returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of july   our cash balance was million 
our cash balance and working capital needs are generally low  as sales are made for cash or through credit cards that are quickly converted to cash  purchases of food and supplies and other operating expenses are generally paid within to days after receipt of invoices and labor costs are paid bi weekly 
the timing of our sales collections and vendor and labor payments are consistent with other companies engaged in the restaurant industry 
our net working capital increased by million in fiscal primarily as a result of an improvement in our cash position of million and increase in prepaid expenses in fiscal by million due to the timing of payment of our rents 
for fiscal years  and  we generated cash flow from operating activities of million  million and million  respectively 
the decreased cash flow from operations in versus was primarily due to decreased cash from working capital changes and reduced proceeds from tenant improvement allowances 
the increased cash flow from operating activities in versus was largely due to our improved profitability and  to a smaller extent  due to increased cash from working capital changes 
proceeds from tenant improvement allowances in the amount of million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively  also contributed significantly to cash flow from operating activities 
tenant improvement allowances are reimbursements received from certain of our landlords for a portion of initial construction expenditures 
our operating cash flow is enhanced by our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credits to offset our federal income tax liability 
at july   we had million of such carryforwards and credits available through to offset federal taxes 
we expect to fully utilize these carryforwards and credits in the next seven to ten years 
a significant portion of our cash flow generated from operating activities in each of the last three fiscal years has been invested in capital expenditures  the majority of which was for the construction of new restaurants 
we opened four new restaurants in fiscal and seven new restaurants in both fiscal and fiscal the following table  in thousands  details our capital expenditures for the last three fiscal years

in fiscal  we received million of gross proceeds from the issuance of convertible subordinated notes notes and warrants 
approximately million of issuance costs were incurred relative to the notes 
the notes are due december and require interest only payments semi annually 
also in fiscal  we received approximately million from the exercise of stock options 
most of the stock option exercises occurred as a result of a b stock trading plan under which our former chief executive officer exercised approximately million stock options before the options expired at the end of fiscal the exercise price of the options and certain tax withholding liabilities were paid through tendering almost half of the exercised shares with a fair value of million 
in fiscal  and fiscal  we elected to prepay million  million and million  respectively  of our existing debt to reduce our annual interest costs 
the funds to prepay the debt came from excess cash  the million issuance of convertible notes in fiscal and borrowings under the new million senior secured bank credit facility obtained in fiscal no debt extinguishment costs were associated with the fiscal prepayment 
prepayment penalties and a write off of unamortized deferred financing fees totaling  and  were recorded in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  as a result of prepaying the debt before its scheduled maturity 
in march  we obtained a three year million senior secured credit facility with a new lender  lasalle bank 
we initially used a portion of the facility to refinance certain of our existing debt and the facility may also be used to support growth and general working capital needs and provide up to million for the issuance of letters of credit 
the facility is secured by a blanket lien on all personal assets and real property of the company 
borrowings under the facility will bear interest depending on a total funded debt to ebitda ratio and will range from prime to prime plus basis points or  if elected by us  libor plus to basis points 
total funded debt is defined as all indebtedness of the consolidated entities  including senior and subordinated debt  capital lease obligations and contingent liabilities 
we paid an up front fee of  and are required to pay an annual unused commitment fee of to basis points 
the credit facility limits the opening of new company owned restaurants to a maximum of twenty four over a three year period and also limits the amount of dividends and or stock repurchases 
as of july   the company had no outstanding borrowings under this facility and had placed letters of credit of million under the facility with million available for additional borrowing 
outstanding borrowings under the facility may be converted to a five year term loan if the ratio of senior debt to ebitda exceeds specified levels 
the facility requires the company to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and tangible net worth level and not exceed certain thresholds for total funded debt to ebitda and total senior debt to ebitda ratios

we believe that such costs in fiscal will not be significant and will be limited to on going legal costs 
for additional information regarding our commitments and contingencies  including our payments associated with our predecessor company activities  please refer to the information provided under note commitments and contingencies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we believe our cash flow from operations  together with funds available under our million credit facility million available at july  will be sufficient to fund our operations  debt repayment and expansion at least through the end of fiscal however  changes in our operating plans  acceleration of our expansion plans  lower than anticipated sales  increased expenses or other events  including those described in item business risk factors  may cause us to seek additional debt or equity financing on an accelerated basis 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all  and our failure to raise capital when needed could negatively impact our growth plans and our financial condition and results of operations 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to the holders of our common stock and debt financing  if available  may involve significant cash payment obligations and covenants and or financial ratios that restrict our ability to operate or grow our business 
contractual obligations and commitments payments  including interest  due by period as of july  in s contractual obligations total one year and less two to three years four to five years after five years operating leases long term debt letters of credit construction commitments royalties we are obligated under non cancelable operating leases for our headquarters and all but one of our restaurants 
the fixed terms of the restaurant leases range up to years and generally contain multiple renewal options for various periods ranging from five to years 
the table  as presented above  includes only the non cancelable portion of our leases as we are only obligated for that term 
our restaurant leases also contain provisions that require additional rent payments based on sales 
table of contents performance and the payment of common area maintenance charges and real estate taxes 
amounts in this table do not reflect any of these additional amounts 
our long term debt is principally comprised of a million issuance of convertible notes due december the notes are convertible at the option of the holder at any time prior to maturity into shares of common stock  at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment upon certain events 
at any time on or after december   we may redeem some or all of the notes at par plus accrued and unpaid interest 
all of the notes will be automatically converted  at our option  into shares of common stock at the then effective conversion price if the closing price of the common stock exceeds of the then effective conversion price for any out of consecutive trading days at any time within three years after the first issuance date of the notes 
there are no assurances that the convertible debt holders will convert their debt into common shares prior to december  nor are there any assurances that the stock price will rise  allowing us to automatically convert the debt 
if the debt is not converted it may be necessary for us to seek additional financing when this debt matures 
if we seek additional financing there are no assurances that we will be able to do so at that time  and the terms of the debt may not be as favorable as our existing debt 
we have letters of credit outstanding to guarantee performance under insurance contracts and to secure other arrangements 
the letters of credit are irrevocable and have one year renewable terms 
we regularly have commitments under contracts for the purchase of property and equipment and for the construction of buildings under build to suit arrangements or otherwise 
portions of such contracts not completed at july  as stated above were not reflected as assets or liabilities in our consolidated financial statements

r and have not determined whether the adoption will result in future amounts similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
our analysis indicated and we do not believe that the implementation of sfas no 
r will result in any technical violations of the financial covenants under our debt agreements 

table of contents impact of inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food  alcoholic beverages and labor costs 
a large number of our restaurant associates are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage directly affect our labor costs 
many of our leases require us to pay property taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance and utilities  all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 
we believe inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations in recent years 
we cannot predict whether inflation will have an impact on our results of operations in the future 
seasonality our sales fluctuate seasonally and therefore our quarterly results are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 
for fiscal years and  our relative sales were highest in our second quarter october through december  followed by our third quarter january through march  then by our fourth quarter april through june 
our first quarter july through september recorded the lowest relative sales for those years 
factors influencing sales variability in addition to those noted above include the frequency and popularity of sporting events  holidays including which day of the week the holiday occurs and weather 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative market risk disclosures 
we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates and changes in commodity prices 
at july   we were exposed to interest rate fluctuations on approximately million of notes payable carrying variable interest rates 
a hypothetical one hundred basis point increase in interest rates for these notes payable would increase our annual interest expense by approximately  we have also been subject to interest rate market risk for short term invested cash and cash equivalents 
the principal of such invested funds would not be subject to fluctuating value because of their highly liquid short term nature 
as of july   we had no such funds invested in short term maturing investments 
many of the ingredients purchased for use in the food and beverages sold to our guests are subject to unpredictable price volatility outside of our control 
we try to manage this risk by entering into selective short term agreements for the products we use most extensively 
also  we believe that our commodity cost risk is diversified as many of our food products are available from several sources and we have the ability to modify product recipes or vary our menu items offered 
historically  we have also been able to increase certain menu prices in response to food commodity price increases and believe the opportunity may exist in the future 
to compensate for a hypothetical price increase of for food and beverages  we would need to increase prices charged to our guests by an average of approximately 
we have not used financial instruments to hedge our commodity product prices
