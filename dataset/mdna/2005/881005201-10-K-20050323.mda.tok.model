table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction terra nitrogen company  lp is a producer and marketer of nitrogen products for use in agricultural and industrial markets 
nitrogen is a commodity chemical and prices are established based on global supply and demand conditions 
the nitrogen products industry has cycles of oversupply  resulting in lower prices and idled capacity  followed by supply shortages  resulting in high selling prices and higher industry wide production rates 
to be viable under these market conditions  a producer must be among the low cost producers to markets it serves and have a financial position that can sustain it during periods of oversupply 
high nitrogen margins in led to capacity expansion projects globally that resulted in capacity increases that were  in the short term  substantially greater than demand growth  causing oversupply conditions that reduced nitrogen prices 
since  that new global capacity has been partially offset by demand growth as well as permanent plant closings in the us and europe 
during  we determined that market conditions did not justify the ongoing investment in maintenance and replacement capital necessary to extend operations for the remainder of the established useful life at our blytheville  arkansas facility 
accordingly  we recorded a million charge in as an impairment of long lived assets and permanently halted production at the facility in may we continue to produce nitrogen products at our verdigris  oklahoma facility 
natural gas is the most significant raw material in the production of nitrogen products 
north american natural gas costs have increased substantially since since we compete with nitrogen products imported from regions with lower natural gas costs  the oversupply situation during most of the three years ending december  did not permit us to increase selling prices to levels necessary to cover the natural gas cost increases 
this resulted in curtailments of north american nitrogen production 
these curtailments contributed to reductions in global nitrogen product supplies 
imports  most of which are produced at facilities with access to fixed price natural gas supplies  account for a significant portion of us nitrogen product supply 
imported products natural gas costs have been and could continue to be substantially lower than the delivered cost of natural gas to our facilities 
offshore producers are most competitive in regions close to north american points of entry for imports  including the gulf coast and east coast 
our sales volumes primarily depend upon the operating rates for our plants 
we may purchase product from other manufacturers or importers for resale  but gross margins on those volumes would rarely be significant 
the profitability and cash flows from our operations are affected by our ability to manage our costs and expenses other than natural gas  most of which do not materially change for different levels of production or sales 
other factors affecting our operating results include the number of planted acres  transportation costs  weather conditions particularly during the planting season  grain prices and other variables described in items and in the business and properties section of this report 

table of contents critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for reporting purposes 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that reflect significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different amounts being reported under different assumptions and conditions 
our critical accounting policies are described below 
impairments of long lived assets we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of these items 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when title to finished product passes to the customer 
revenue is recognized as the net amount to be received after deducting estimated amounts for discounts and trade allowances 
revenue includes amounts paid by customers for shipping and handling 
gains or losses associated with the settlement of nitrogen derivative contracts are included as revenues 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost and estimated net realizable value 
the average cost of inventories is determined using the first in  first out method 
the nitrogen industry is characterized by rapid change in both demand and pricing 
rapid demand declines could result in temporary or permanent production curtailment  while rapid price declines could result in a lower of cost and market adjustment 
derivatives and financial instruments the partnership accounts for derivatives in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires the recognition of derivatives in the balance sheet and the measurement of these instruments at fair value 
changes in fair value of derivatives are recorded in earnings unless the normal purchase or sale exception or hedge accounting is elected 
the general partner enters into derivative instruments including future contracts  swap agreements  and purchased options to cap or fix prices for a portion of our natural gas production requirements 
the general partner also uses similar derivative instruments to fix or set floor prices for a portion of our nitrogen sales volumes 
the general partner has designated  documented and assessed accounting hedge relationships  which mostly resulted in cash flow hedges that require the partnership to record the 
table of contents derivative assets or liabilities at their fair value on its balance sheet with an offset in other comprehensive income 
amounts are removed from other comprehensive income as the underlying transactions occur and realized gains or losses are recorded 
factors that affect operating performance factors that may affect the partnership s operating results include the relative balance of supply and demand for nitrogen fertilizers  the availability and cost of natural gas  the number of planted acres which is affected by both worldwide demand and government policies  the types of crops planted  the effects general weather patterns have on the timing and duration of fieldwork for crop planting and harvesting  the effect of environmental legislation on supply and demand for the partnership s products  the availability of financing sources to fund seasonal working capital needs and the potential for interruption to operations due to accidents or natural disasters 
the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen products is natural gas 
natural gas costs in accounted for about of total costs and expenses for the partnership 
a significant increase in the price of natural gas that is not covered by forward pricing arrangements or recovered through an increase in the price of related nitrogen products would have an adverse effect on the partnership s business  financial condition and results of operations 
a portion of global nitrogen products is manufactured at facilities with access to fixed price natural gas supplies that have been  and could continue to be  priced substantially lower than the partnership s natural gas 
the partnership enters into forward pricing contracts for natural gas when such arrangements would not result in costs that would be greater than expected selling prices for finished products manufactured by the partnership 
terra s natural gas forward pricing policy which is applicable to the partnership has been to fix or cap the price of between and of its natural gas requirements for a rolling month period and up to of its natural gas requirements for the subsequent month period through supply contracts  financial derivatives and other instruments 
deviations from this policy are permitted through notification to terra s board of directors 
the partnership s december  forward positions do not extend beyond and covered of the verdigris facility s natural gas consumption 
prices for nitrogen products are influenced by the world supply and demand balance for ammonia and other nitrogen based products 
long term demand is affected by population growth and rising living standards that influence food consumption 
short term demand is affected by world economic conditions and international trade decisions 
for example  demand was reduced  in part  due to relatively high nitrogen prices and low grain prices 
supply is affected by increasing worldwide capacity and the availability of nitrogen product exports from major producing regions such as the former soviet union  the middle east and south america 
weather can significantly affect demand for the partnership s products 
weather conditions that delay or intermittently disrupt fieldwork during the planting season may cause agricultural customers to use forms of nitrogen fertilizer that are more or less favorable to the partnership s sales 
weather conditions following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall 
weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields  which lowers the income of growers and could impair their ability to pay for crop inputs purchased from our dealer customers 
conversely  low crop yields often increase the planted areas in the subsequent growing season  which  in turn  increases the demand for nitrogen fertilizer 

table of contents the partnership s business is highly seasonal  with the majority of its products used during the second quarter in conjunction with spring planting 
due to the business seasonality and the relatively brief periods during which products can be used by customers  the partnership and its customers generally build inventories during the second half of the year to ensure product availability during the peak sales season 
for its current level of sales  the partnership requires lines of credit to fund inventory increases and to support customer credit terms 
the partnership believes that its credit facilities are adequate for expected sales levels 
the partnership s operations may be subject to significant interruption if its facility were to experience a major accident or natural disaster 
the partnership currently maintains insurance  including business interruption insurance  which it believes is sufficient to cover major damage to any of its facilities

sales prices were higher as the result of increased demand and lower nitrogen fertilizer supplies caused by industry wide production curtailments since mid price increases also reflected higher imported product costs as the result of us currency declines relative to other currencies and increased international freight rates 
sales volumes in were lower than the previous year due to the blytheville production facility s permanent closure in may gross profits during were million  an increase of million from higher selling prices contributed million to gross profits  but were offset by higher natural gas costs and increased fixed cost spending

unit price ammonia uan urea after deducting outbound freight costs revenues for were million and increased million  or  from million in selling prices were higher as the result of lower nitrogen fertilizer supplies caused by increased demand and industry wide production curtailments 
sales volumes in were lower than the previous year due to curtailments of partnership production 
the partnership ceased production at the blytheville  arkansas facility and one of the two verdigris  oklahoma ammonia plants on february  because of high natural gas prices 
the partnership resumed full capacity production at both facilities on march  when natural gas prices decreased and product prices improved 
on july   the partnership suspended ammonia and urea production at blytheville due to concerns that the facility would not cover its cash costs because of continuing high natural gas costs and seasonal declines in fertilizer prices 
blytheville production resumed on october  in response to higher urea selling prices and improved seasonal demand 
gross profits during were million  a decline of million from higher selling prices contributed million to gross profits  but were more than offset by higher natural gas costs  lower sales volumes and idle plant costs 
the cost of natural gas purchases increased million  or over as unit costs  net of forward pricing gains and losses  increased to per million british thermal units for compared to mmbtu for natural gas costs in were million higher than spot prices as the result of forward price contracts 
operating expenses of million declined million from  or  as the result of reduced headcount and lower spending for administrative activities 
during  the partnership recorded a million charge for the impairment of blytheville s long term assets as the partnership s general partner  tnc  concluded that future market conditions may not justify ongoing investment in the maintenance and replacement capital required to operate the blytheville facility for its established useful life 
net interest expense of million was million lower than in due to lower borrowing levels and higher cash balances 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities for was million compared to million in  an increase of million principally due to higher earnings and working capital changes 
working capital changes represented a million increase to cash flows due to a million increase to current liabilities from higher customer prepayments  which reflected the higher price and demand for prepayment arrangements as compared to the previous year  and a million reduction to year end receivables and inventory balances due principally to the cessation of production at the blytheville 
table of contents facility 
at december   we had received million of customer prepayments that we expect to substantially fulfill during the first half of capital expenditures of million during were used primarily to fund replacement and stay in business additions to plant and equipment 
the partnership expects capital expenditures to approximate million to fund replacement and stay in business additions to plant and equipment 
contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments  other than notes due to affiliates  were as follows at december  payments due in in thousands less than one year one to three years three to five years thereafter capital lease obligations operating leases total the partnership s principal funding needs are to support its working capital and capital expenditures 
the partnership intends to fund its needs primarily from cash provided by operating activities and  to the extent required  from funds borrowed under the partnership s revolving bank credit facility described in the following paragraph 
on december   the partnership entered into a million revolving bank credit facility that expires in june under the credit facility  the partnership may borrow an amount generally based on eligible cash balances  of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible finished goods inventory  less outstanding letters of credit 
the partnership s borrowings under the credit facility are secured by substantially all of its working capital 
at december   borrowing availability exceeded million and the partnership had no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under the facility 
management expects the facility to be adequate to meet the partnership s operating cash needs 
under the credit facility  the partnership is subject to the covenants which impose certain limitations on additional debt  capital expenditures  acquisitions  liens  asset sales  investments  prepayments of subordinated indebtedness  changes in lines of business and transactions with affiliates 
in addition  if the partnership s aggregate borrowing availability falls below million  it is required to have generated million of operating cash flows or earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization and other non cash items as defined in the credit facility for the preceding four quarters 
the partnership is also required to maintain a minimum aggregate unused borrowing availability of million at all times 
the partnership s ability to continue to meet the covenants under the credit facility in the future will depend on market conditions  operating cash flows  working capital needs  receipt of customer prepayments and trade credit terms 
failure to meet these covenants  or to obtain a waiver from the lenders  would result in a default by the partnership such that all outstanding amounts could become immediately due and payable and the partnership would be unable to borrow additional amounts under the credit facility 
because access to adequate bank facilities may be critical to funding the partnership s operating cash needs and purchase of financial derivatives to manage the partnership s exposure to natural gas commodity price risk  any default or termination of the joint revolving bank credit facility could have a material adverse effect on the partnership 

table of contents we currently anticipate that the partnership will be able to meet its covenants through nevertheless  if there were to be any adverse changes in the factors listed above  there can be no assurance that this would be the case 
expenditures related to environmental  health and safety regulation compliance are primarily composed of operating costs that totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
because environmental  health and safety regulations are expected to continue to change and generally to be more restrictive than current requirements  the costs of compliance will likely increase 
the partnership does not expect its compliance with such regulations will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations  financial position or net cash flows 
in addition  the partnership incurred  and  of capital expenditures in  and  respectively  related to capital improvements to ensure compliance with environmental  health and safety regulations 
the partnership may be required to install additional air and water quality control equipment  such as low nitrous oxide burners  scrubbers  ammonia sensors and continuous emission monitors to continue to achieve compliance with the clean air act and similar requirements 
these equipment requirements typically apply to competitors as well 
the partnership estimates that the cost of complying with these existing requirements in and beyond will be less than million 
quarterly distributions to tnclp s partners are based on available cash for the quarter as defined in the tnclp agreement of limited partnership 
available cash is defined generally as all cash receipts less all cash disbursements  adjusted for changes in certain reserves established as the general partner determines in its reasonable discretion to be necessary 
distributions paid to the partners in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
distributions of available cash are made to the limited partners and to the general partner  except that the general partner is entitled  as an incentive  to larger percentage interests to the extent that distributions of available cash exceed specified levels 
the specified levels are increased by the amount of quarterly distributions to holders of common units that are less than per unit 
as of december   the cumulative shortfall on quarterly distributions to holders of common units that must be paid before the general partner receives an incentive payment was million  or per unit 
recently issued accounting standards in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb approved the consensus reached on the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the objective of this issue is to provide guidance for identifying impaired investments 
eitf also provides new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
the accounting provisions of eitf are effective for all reporting periods beginning after june   while the disclosure requirements are effective only for annual periods ending after june  the impact of the adoption on the company s financial position or net income was not material 
in november  the fasb issued statement of financial standards sfas no 
an amendment of arb no 
 chapter 
the statement clarifies the abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage that should be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  the statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the statement is effective 
table of contents for fiscal years beginning after june  the impact of the adoption on the company s financial position or net income has not been determined 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of accounting principles bulletin apb opinion no 

the statement amends opinion to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the company are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the statement is effective for fiscal periods beginning after june  the impact of the adoption on the company s financial position or net income has not been determined 
general partner option to effect mandatory redemption of partnership units at december   the general partner and its affiliates owned of the partnership s outstanding units 
when less than of the issued and outstanding units are held by non affiliates of the general partner  as is the case at december   the partnership  at the general partner s sole discretion  may call  or assign to the general partner or its affiliates its right to acquire  all such outstanding units held by non affiliated persons 
if the general partner elects to acquire all outstanding units  the partnership is required to give at least but not more than days notice of its decision to purchase the outstanding units 
the purchase price per unit will be the greater of the average of the previous trading days closing prices as of the date five days before the purchase is announced and the highest price paid by the general partner or any of its affiliates for any unit within the days preceding the date the purchase is announced 
dependence on terra industries the partnership is dependent on terra industries inc terra in a number of respects 
terra provides all of the partnership s management services and operates all of its facilities through its wholly owned subsidiary tnc  the partnership s general partner 
terra and its wholly owned subsidiaries  including tnc  have more debt and debt service requirements than the partnership 
although terra is affected by most of the factors that affect the partnership  its higher level of debt could put a greater risk on terra in the event business conditions deteriorate materially 
the partnership s results of operations and financial condition might be materially adversely affected by financial difficulties at terra  default by it or its subsidiaries on their debt or their bankruptcy

forward looking precautions information contained in this report  other than historical information  may be considered forward looking 
forward looking information reflects management s current views of future events and financial performance that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to  the following changes in the financial markets  general economic conditions within the agricultural industry  competitive factors and price changes principally  nitrogen products selling prices and natural gas costs  changes in product mix  changes in the seasonality of demand patterns  changes in weather conditions  changes in agricultural regulations  and other risks detailed in the factors that affect operating results section of this discussion 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management and financial instruments market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the partnership due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
the partnership uses derivative financial instruments to manage risk in the area of changes in natural gas prices 
the partnership has no foreign currency exchange rate risk and all debt carries variable interest rates and approximates fair value 
the general partner s policy is to avoid unnecessary risk and to limit  to the extent practical  risks associated with operating activities 
the general manager may not engage in activities that expose the partnership to speculative or non operating risks 
management is expected to limit risks to acceptable levels 
the use of derivative financial instruments is consistent with the overall business objectives of the partnership 
derivatives are used to manage operating risk within the limits established by the general partner s board of directors  and in response to identified exposures  provided they qualify as hedge activities 
as such  derivative financial instruments are used to hedge firm commitments and forecasted commodity purchase transactions 
the use of derivative financial instruments subjects the partnership to some inherent risks associated with future contractual commitments  including market and operational risks  credit risk associated with counterparties  product location basis differentials and market liquidity 
the general partner continuously monitors the valuation of identified risks and adjusts the portfolio based on current market conditions 
natural gas is the principal raw material used to manufacture nitrogen 
natural gas prices are volatile and the general partner manages some of this volatility through the use of derivative commodity instruments 
terra industries hedging policy which is applicable to tnclp is described under the previous heading  factors that affect operating performance 
the partnership has hedged of expected requirements and none of its requirements beyond december  the fair value of these instruments is estimated based on published referenced prices and quoted market prices from brokers 
these instruments fixed natural gas prices at million higher than published prices for december  forward markets 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse price change 
as of december   the partnership s market risk exposure related to future hedged natural gas requirements was million based on a sensitivity analysis 
changes in the market value of these derivative instruments have a high correlation to changes in the spot price of natural gas 
since the partnership forward prices only a portion of its natural gas requirements  this hypothetical adverse impact on natural gas derivative instruments should be more than offset by lower costs for natural gas purchases
