item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three years  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the other information appearing elsewhere in this report 
due to the severity and length of the downturn in the electronic component and computer product industry and in the global economy as a whole  we have recorded charges in recent years that are discussed more fully in restructuring and other charges in this md a 
these charges have had a significant impact on our results of operations for the years ended december  and presented in this report as discussed further below 
in addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  we may also disclose pro forma or non gaap measures that may exclude certain items 
management believes that providing this additional information is useful to the reader to better assess and understand operating performance  especially when comparing results with previous periods or forecasting performance for future periods 
management believes the pro forma measures also help indicate underlying trends in the business 
management also uses pro forma information to establish operational goals and  in some cases  for measuring performance for compensation purposes 
however  analysis of results and outlook on a pro forma or non gaap basis should be used as a complement to  and in conjunction with  data presented in accordance with gaap 
when used in this report  the words expects  anticipates  estimates  intends and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements within the meaning of section a under the securities act of and section e under the securities exchange act of such statements include but are not limited to statements regarding the ability to obtain favorable product allocations and the ability to increase gross profit while controlling expenses 
these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially  including those risks described under risk factors in item hereof 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience  however actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting polices as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and those that require significant judgments and estimates 
management believes our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition bell s policy is to recognize revenue from sales to customers when the rights and risks of ownership have passed to the customer  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
under specific conditions  we permit our customers to return or exchange products 
the provision for estimated returns is recorded concurrently with the recognition of revenue based on historical sales returns and analysis of credit memorandum data 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that we estimate will arise from our customers inability to make required payments 
we make our estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts  specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
at december  the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and at december  it was million 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
in  our bad debt expense was million compared to million in in  restructuring and special charges of million were recorded in the second quarter that related to a rapid deterioration in the financial condition of certain customers in latin america resulting in their inability to make payments 
events giving rise to this provision related to the economic crisis in argentina and the devaluation of the argentinean peso 
valuation of inventory inventories are recorded at the lower of cost first in first out or estimated market value 
our inventories include high technology components  embedded systems and computing technologies sold into rapidly changing  cyclical and competitive markets whereby such inventories may be subject to early technological obsolescence 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand  selling prices and market conditions 
in the first quarter of  we recorded inventory charges of million of charges related to excess inventory on hand 
these additional write downs resulted from market conditions  changes to certain vendor relationships and the decision to discontinue certain product lines 
these charges were included in the statement of operations within the caption cost of sales 
we evaluate inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors that may render inventories unmarketable at normal margins 
write downs are recorded so that inventories reflect the approximate net realizable value and take into account our contractual provisions with our suppliers governing price protection  stock rotation and return privileges relating to obsolescence 
because of the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing the process around price protections and stock rotations  estimates are made regarding adjustments to the carrying amount of inventories 
additionally  assumptions about future demand  market conditions and decisions to discontinue certain product lines can impact the decision to write down inventories 
if assumptions about future demand change or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs of inventories may be required 
in any case  actual amounts could be different from those estimated 
special and acquisition related charges we have been subject to the financial impact of integrating acquired businesses and charges related to business reorganizations 
in connection with such events  management is required to make estimates about the financial impact of such matters that are inherently uncertain 
accrued liabilities and reserves are established to cover the cost of severance  facility consolidation and closure  lease termination fees  inventory adjustments based upon acquisition related termination of supplier agreements and or the evaluation of the acquired working capital assets inventory and accounts receivable  change in control expenses  and write down of other acquired assets including goodwill 
actual amounts incurred could be different from those estimated 
valuation of accounts payable our accounts payable has been reduced by amounts claimed to vendors for returns  price protection and other amounts related to incentive programs 
amounts related to price protection and other incentive programs are recorded as adjustments to product costs or selling  general and administrative expenses  depending on the nature of the program 
there is a time delay between the submission of a claim by us and confirmation of agreement by our vendors 
historically  our estimated claims have approximated amounts agreed to by our vendors 
accounting for income taxes management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of our net foreign operating loss carry forwards is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
in addition  we consider historic levels of income  expectations and risk associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing a tax valuation allowance 
should we determine that we are not able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  a valuation allowance is recorded against the deferred tax assets with a corresponding charge to income in the period such determination is made 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets at december   goodwill amounted to million and identifiable intangible assets amounted to million 
we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate a possible impairment of goodwill 
in determining whether there is an impairment of goodwill  we calculate the estimated fair value of our company based on the closing sales price of our common stock and projected discounted cash flows as of the date we perform the impairment tests 
we then compare the resulting fair value to our respective net book value  including goodwill 
if the net book value of our company exceeds its fair value  we measure the amount of the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of our goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
to the extent that the carrying amount of our goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  we recognize a goodwill impairment loss 
we perform this impairment test annually and whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there is a possible impairment of goodwill 
we completed the required annual impairment test  which resulted in no impairment for fiscal year we believe the methodology we use in testing impairment of goodwill provides us with a reasonable basis in determining whether an impairment charge should be taken 
hedge accounting we generate a substantial portion of our revenues in international markets  which subjects our operations and cash flows to the exposure of currency exchange fluctuations 
we seek to minimize the risk associated with currency exchange fluctuations by entering into forward exchange contracts to hedge certain foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities 
these derivatives do not qualify for sfas hedge accounting treatment 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of these hedges are recorded immediately in earnings on line item interest expense and other income to offset the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged

we achieved record revenues for both reporting periods and generated revenue improvement in all geographies and all major product categories compared to the same periods last year

recent accounting pronouncements in april  the emerging issues task force issued statement no 
participating securities and the two class method under fasb statement no 
 earnings per share eitf 
eitf addresses a number of questions regarding the computation of earnings per share by companies that have issued securities other than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to participate in dividends and earnings of the company when  and if  it declares dividends on its common stock 
the issue also provides further guidance in applying the two class method of calculating earnings per share  clarifying what constitutes a participating security and how to apply the two class method of computing earnings per share once it is determined that a security is participating  including how to allocate undistributed earnings to such a security 
eitf is effective for fiscal periods beginning after march  the adoption of eitf did not have a material effect on our earnings per share for the three month and twelve month periods ended december   as we do not have participating securities 
in september  the emerging issues task force issued statement no 
 applying paragraph of fas in determining whether to aggregate operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds  eitf 
the eitf gives guidance to companies on what to consider in determining the aggregation criteria and guidance from paragraphs and of sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
specifically  whether operating segments must always have similar economic characteristics and meet a majority of the remaining five aggregation criteria  items a e  listed in paragraph of sfas  or whether operating segments must meet a majority of all six aggregation criteria that is  the five aggregation criteria  items a e  listed in paragraph and similar economic characteristics  in determining the appropriate segment reporting disclosures 
we are in the process of assessing the impact of eitf on our financial statement disclosures 
on october  the financial accounting standards board fasb ratified the consensus the eitf reached on eitf  the effect of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share 
this eitf changes the way shares of common stock that are issuable upon conversion of certain instruments are treated in the calculation of diluted earnings per share 
in addition to prospective application  this eitf requires retroactive restatement of prior period earnings per share for all periods in which securities outstanding at december  the effective date of this guidance were outstanding 
as of december   we had two series of contingently convertible notes outstanding  including approximately million in aggregate principal amount of its convertible subordinated notes due the old notes and approximately million in aggregate principal amount of its convertible subordinated notes  series b due the new notes 
because the terms of the old notes require settlement in shares of common stock of the full value of the notes upon conversion  all shares potentially issuable at the end of each reporting period would be included in diluted weighted average shares outstanding 
in addition  for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share  we would be required to add back to net income the after tax interest expense on the notes for each reporting period  as if the notes had been converted to common stock at the beginning of the period 
we have concluded that the restatement would have no material effect on previously reported diluted earnings per share 
the new notes would only be included in the diluted earnings per share calculation at such time in the future when our stock price rises above the conversion price 
the dilutive impact would be equal to the number of shares needed to satisfy the in the money value of the new notes  assuming conversion see note for a discussion of the new notes 
the adoption of this consensus did not have a material impact on diluted earnings per share for the period ended december  in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter 
this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
this statement requires those items to be excluded from the cost of inventory and expensed when incurred 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement is effective for companies at the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material effect on the results of operations or consolidated financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r sfas r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
we currently account for our employee stock options in accordance with apb while disclosing the pro forma effect of the options and restricted stock grants had they been recorded under the fair value method 
as required by the statement  we plan to adopt the revised statement in our quarter ending june  we are in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk on our variable rate credit facilities and could be subjected to increased interest payments if market interest rates fluctuate 
for the year ended december   average borrowings outstanding on the variable rate credit facility with congress financial corporation western were million  average borrowings with wachovia bank  national association and blue ridge asset funding corporation were million and average borrowings with bank of america  na were million 
these facilities have interest rates that are based on associated rates such as eurodollar and base or prime rates that may fluctuate over time based on changes in the economic environment 
based on actual borrowings throughout the year under these borrowing facilities  an increase of in such interest rate percentages would increase the annual interest expense by approximately million 
a substantial part of our revenue and capital expenditures are transacted in us dollars  but the functional currency for foreign subsidiaries is not the us dollar 
we enter into foreign forward exchange contracts to hedge certain balance sheet exposures against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
the gains and losses on the forward exchange contracts are largely offset by gains or losses on the underlying transactions and  consequently  a sudden or significant change in foreign exchange rates should not have a material impact on future net income or cash flows 
as a result of bell or its subsidiaries entering into transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency  bell recognized a foreign currency gain of  during the year ended december  to the extent we are unable to manage these risks  our results  financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
in august  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in order to gain access to the lower borrowing rates normally available on floating rate debt  while avoiding prepayment and other costs that would be associated with refinancing long term fixed rate debt 
the swap purchased has a notional amount of million  expiring in june  with a six month settlement period and provides for variable interest at libor plus a set rate spread 
the notional amount is amortized ratably as the underlying debt is repaid 
the notional amount at december  was million 
the notional amount does not quantify risk or represent assets or liabilities  but rather  is used in the determination of cash settlement under the swap agreement 
as a result of purchasing this swap  we will be exposed to credit losses from counter party non performance  however  we do not anticipate any such losses from this agreement  which is with a major financial institution 
the agreement will also expose us to interest rate risk should libor rise during the term of the agreement 
this swap agreement is accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
under the provisions of sfas  we initially recorded the interest rate swap at fair value  and subsequently recorded any changes in fair value as an offset to the related liability 
fair value is determined based on quoted market prices  which reflect the difference between estimated future variable rate payments and future fixed rate receipts 
the fair value of the interest rate swap was  at december
