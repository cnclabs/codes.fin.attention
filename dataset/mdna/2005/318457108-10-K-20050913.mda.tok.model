item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly under the caption business risk factors 
general prior to our april  acquisition of usauto holdings  inc  we were engaged in pursuing opportunities to acquire one or more operating companies 
in addition  we marketed for sale a portfolio of foreclosed real estate 
we will continue to market the remaining real estate held consisting of six tracts of land in san antonio  texas and will attempt to sell it on a basis that provides us with the best economic return 
we do not anticipate any new investments in real estate  although we acquired a tract of land adjacent to one of our properties for million in december to enhance the marketability of the adjacent parcel 
as a result of the usauto acquisition  we are now principally a retailer  servicer and underwriter of non standard personal automobile insurance  based in nashville  tennessee 
non standard personal automobile insurance is made available to individuals who are categorized as non standard because of their inability or unwillingness to obtain standard insurance coverage due to various factors  including payment history  payment preference  failure in the past to maintain continuous insurance coverage  driving record and or vehicle type  and in most instances who are required by law to buy a minimum amount of automobile insurance 
effective january   we acquired the assets principally the book of business and retail locations of a non standard automobile insurance agency in texas for million in cash 
as of september   we leased retail locations  staffed by employee agents 
our employee agents exclusively sell insurance products underwritten by us 
we write non standard personal automobile insurance in states and we are licensed as an insurer in additional states 
the following table shows the changes in the number of our retail locations for the periods presented

table of contents our consolidated financial statements now vary in important respects from our historical consolidated financial statements due to the acquisition of usauto 
for the year ended june   the recorded financial results reflect twelve months of our previous operations  but only the two months of results of the insurance operations following the april  acquisition date 
the year ended june  reflects primarily the results from our insurance operations for the full year 
the acquisition of usauto was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the consideration consisted of million in cash   shares of our common stock issued at closing and  shares issued upon the attainment of certain financial targets 
the aggregate purchase price of million was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values as of the date of the acquisition 
total goodwill and identifiable intangible assets recorded from the acquisition were million  which was net of a million reduction in our deferred tax allowance based upon our projections of usauto s future taxable income 
of the purchase price  million was allocated to an identifiable intangible asset relating to future policy renewals existing as of april  this asset is amortizable and resulted in amortization expense of million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
amortization expense for the year ending june  will be million 
our results for the year ended june  included expenses that have been discontinued as a result of the acquisition of usauto 
these principally consist of compensation to employees who were terminated in connection with the acquisition 
however  the current period includes as will future periods the cost of the advisory services agreement with an entity controlled by donald j 
edwards  our former president and chief executive officer  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these items have been incorporated into the presentation of pro forma operating results for the years ended june  and  which assume that the acquisition of usauto occurred on july  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
consolidated results of operations overview the year ended june  reflects the results of our insurance operations for the full year  while the year ended june  reflects the results of our acquisition activities and the real estate operations for the full year  and the results of our insurance operations for the two months following the date of the usauto acquisition 
in addition to the actual results  we will also discuss pro forma operating results that assume that the usauto acquisition occurred on july  we will also separately discuss both the results of the real estate and corporate activities and the insurance operations 
such segment information is summarized below on both an actual and pro forma basis for the periods presented

we conduct our underwriting operations through two insurance company subsidiaries usauto insurance company  inc and village auto insurance company  inc our insurance operations revenues are primarily derived from premiums earned which includes policy and renewal fees from i sales of policies issued by our insurance company subsidiaries  net of the portion of those premiums that have been ceded to reinsurers  and ii the sales of policies issued by our managing general agency subsidiaries and assumed by our insurance company subsidiaries through quota share reinsurance  fee income  which includes installment billing fees on policies written as well as fees for other ancillary services principally a motor club product  commission income paid by our reinsurer to us for ceded premiums through the september  non renewal of our quota share reinsurance  and investment income earned on the invested assets of the insurance company subsidiaries 
because we have discontinued writing policies through other insurance companies as a managing general agency and now write those policies through our insurance company subsidiaries or assume them through quota share reinsurance  our commissions for selling and servicing policies on behalf of third party insurance companies have decreased while premiums earned by insurance company subsidiaries have increased 

table of contents the following table presents gross premiums earned by state for the insurance operations separately for policies written by the insurance company subsidiaries and for policies issued by the mga subsidiaries on behalf of other insurance companies which are now all assumed by us through quota share reinsurance contracts  on both an actual and a pro forma basis for the periods presented 
we believe this table illustrates the total gross premiums serviced by us and under our control

this table represents the net underwriting risk retained by us after considering the effects of reinsurance 
alabama premiums shown are assumed by us through a quota share reinsurance contract  which was increased from to  effective february   and from to  effective february  likewise  texas premiums are assumed by us through a quota share reinsurance contract 
we have obtained our license in alabama and  commencing in may  all new policies in alabama are written on a direct basis by usauto insurance company 

table of contents pro forma actual unaudited year ended june  year ended june  in thousands georgia tennessee alabama ohio texas mississippi missouri indiana florida illinois pennsylvania total net premiums earned insurance companies present a combined ratio as a measure of their overall underwriting profitability 
the components of the combined ratio are as follows loss ratio loss ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to premiums earned and is a basic element of underwriting profitability 
we calculate this ratio based on all direct and assumed premiums earned  net of ceded reinsurance 
expense ratio expense ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of insurance operating expenses to premiums earned 
this is a measurement which illustrates relative management efficiency in administering our operations 
we calculate this ratio on a net basis as a percentage of net premiums earned 
insurance operating expenses are reduced by fee income from insureds and ceding commissions received from our reinsurer as compensation for the costs we incur in servicing policies on their behalf 
combined ratio combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio 
if the combined ratio is at or above  an insurance company cannot be profitable without sufficient investment income 
the following table presents the combined ratios for the insurance operations on both an actual and a pro forma basis for the periods presented 
pro forma actual unaudited year ended june  year ended june  loss and loss adjustment expense expense the invested assets of the insurance operations are generally highly liquid and consist substantially of readily marketable  investment grade bonds and collateralized mortgage obligations 
at june   approximately of our fixed maturities portfolio was tax exempt 
this percentage has decreased and will continue to decrease over time as we move to a taxable portfolio 
all cash equivalents were taxable 
most securities held are issued by political subdivisions in the states of georgia and tennessee as these type of investments enable our insurance company subsidiaries to obtain premium tax credits 
investment income is primarily composed of interest earned on these securities  net of related investment expenses 
realized gains and losses on our investment portfolio may occur from time to time as changes are made to our holdings based upon changes in interest rates and changes in the credit quality of securities held 
the non standard personal automobile insurance industry is cyclical in nature 
in the past  the industry has been characterized by periods of price competition and excess capacity followed by periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity 
if new competitors enter this market  existing competitors may attempt to increase market share by lowering rates 
such conditions could lead to reduced prices  which would negatively impact usauto s revenues and profitability 
however  we believe that between and  the underwriting results in the personal automobile insurance industry improved as a result of favorable pricing and competitive 
table of contents conditions that allowed for broad increases in rate levels by insurers 
rates and premium levels for non standard automobile insurance have stabilized or slightly decreased during fiscal year ended june  compared with fiscal year ended june  actual consolidated results net income for the year ended june  was million  compared to a net loss of million for the year ended june  the prior fiscal year s results reflect only the two months of insurance operating results following the april  acquisition of usauto 
prior to this date  the results for the year ended june  reflect real estate operations and the costs associated with acquisition opportunities 
the prior year s results also include severance costs to our former employees incurred as a result of the usauto acquisition 
net income per share for the year ended june  was and on a basic and diluted basis  respectively  as compared to a net loss per share of on both a basic and diluted basis for the year ended june  the weighted average shares outstanding increased as a result of the additional shares issued in the april rights offering and the usauto acquisition  as well as the  contingent shares issued effective december  in connection with the usauto acquisition 
the income tax expense benefit for the year ended june  includes a  decrease in the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset 
such decrease was a result of taxable income for the year ended june  exceeding the estimate used by management in establishing the valuation allowance at june  in addition to a revision in management s estimate for our future taxable income based on the results for the most recent fiscal year 
net income per share for the year ended june  was increased by and on a basic and diluted basis  respectively  as a result of this change in the valuation allowance 
pro forma consolidated results on a pro forma basis  net income for the year ended june  was million 
pro forma net income per share for the year ended june  was and on a basic and diluted basis  respectively 
actual results insurance operations for the year ended june   the insurance operations recorded income before income taxes of million 
the combined ratio for this period was  which includes a loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of and an expense ratio of 
pro forma results insurance operations on a pro forma basis  income before income taxes for the year ended june  was million compared to actual income before income taxes of million for the year ended june  net premiums earned increased by to million for the year ended june  from million on a pro forma basis for the year ended june  a significant part of this increase is the result of eliminating our quota share reinsurance on the september  renewal date 
as a result  our reinsurance was only in effect for two months of year ended june  and for all of the year ended june  had we renewed the quota share reinsurance  net premiums earned would have been reduced by million for the year ended june  in addition to the above factor  net premiums earned during the year ended june  also increased as we increased the assumed reinsurance percentage for our alabama business written through other insurance companies from to effective february   and from to effective february  as a result of these changes  net premiums earned increased by million for the year ended june  we are now licensed in alabama and  starting in may  we began writing all new policies in alabama on a direct basis 
as a result  in alabama  we no longer incur the contractual costs associated with writing business through another insurance company 

table of contents to a lesser extent  net premiums earned also increased as we continued to write more of our insurance business in georgia through our insurance company subsidiaries rather than through our managing general agency mga operations for other insurance companies 
gross premiums earned through the georgia mga operations decreased from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  as a result of not renewing the quota share reinsurance and shifting the insurance underwriting from the mga operations to our insurance company subsidiaries  commissions and fees declined as a percentage of net premiums earned during the year ended june  compared to the prior year and ceding commissions from our reinsurer also decreased 
the year ended june   however  includes an additional ceding commission of million  which has been recorded based upon the favorable loss experience during the last contract year of the quota share reinsurance program which was non renewed effective september  overall  the number of insured policies in force both insurance company and mga at june  increased over the same date in net premiums earned for the year ended june  also increased as a result of the texas operations  which were acquired effective january  in addition to texas  during the year ended june   we also commenced operations in illinois  florida and pennsylvania 
during the year ended june   the number of retail locations or stores increased by  from stores at june  to stores at june   including stores in the pre opening stage 
included in the fiscal figure are the stores acquired in texas on january  during the year ended june   on a pro forma basis  we leased new stores 
investment income increased primarily as a result of the increase in invested assets as a result of our growth 
we also expect investment income to continue to increase as we shift the investment portfolio from tax exempt to taxable investments 
the weighted average investment yield for our fixed maturities portfolio was at june  with a duration of years 
the yield for the comparable lehman brothers indices at june  was 
the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio increased to for the year ended june  from on a pro forma basis for the year ended june  we did not experience any significant development for losses occurring in prior accident periods 
in addition  the loss ratio for the year ended june  increased slightly over the prior year as a result of the non renewal of the quota share reinsurance  which resulted in a higher percentage increase in losses and loss expenses incurred than the percentage increase in net premiums earned 
this occurred since policy and renewal fees included in net premiums earned were not ceded to the reinsurer and therefore remained the same relative to dollar amounts in both periods 
insurance operating expenses increased to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  this increase is primarily due to expenses advertising  employee agent compensation  rent and premium taxes that vary along with the increase in net premiums earned and the addition of new retail locations 
the expense ratio increased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  operating expenses incurred for new retail locations contributed to the increase in the expense ratio 
in addition  the expense ratio has also increased as a result of declining fee income from ancillary products which reduces expenses in calculating the expense ratio  and the fact that this fee income was spread over a larger base of net premiums earned as result of not renewing the quota share reinsurance 
to a lesser extent  the expense ratio also increased as net operating expenses increased due to the elimination of ceding commissions received  which were at a slightly lesser rate than actual operating expenses incurred 
the increase for the year ended june   however  was tempered by the additional ceding commission of million 
overall  on a pro forma basis  the combined ratio increased to for the year ended june  from for the year ended june  in addition  during the year ended june   we recognized a million gain on the sale of property and equipment as a result of the sale of an aircraft previously used in the insurance operations 

table of contents actual results real estate and corporate loss before income taxes for the year ended june  was million versus loss before income taxes of million for the year ended june  for the year ended june   gains on sales of foreclosed real estate were million  as compared to million for the year ended june  gains on sales of real estate represents proceeds received from the sale of foreclosed real estate in excess of carrying value  less selling costs 
investment income was million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  the decrease in available cash equivalents as a result of the usauto acquisition was offset by a higher return earned during the most recent fiscal year on our investment in mutual fund 
other operating expenses for fiscal primarily represent costs associated with being an operating public company including the initial costs of implementing the sarbanes oxley act of while other operating expenses for fiscal primarily represent the cost of former employees who were terminated as a result of the usauto acquisition 
pro forma results real estate and corporate on a pro forma basis  income before taxes for the year ended june  was million 
these results exclude compensation of terminated employees and reflect only the real estate operations and costs related to acquisition opportunities 
the results also reflect interest expense on usauto s note payable 
fiscal year ended june  compared with fiscal year ended june  actual consolidated results net loss for the year ended june  was million  as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended june  the fiscal results reflect only real estate operations and the costs associated with acquisition opportunities 
the fiscal results are significantly impacted by the inclusion of two months of insurance operating results as well as the severance cost to our former employees 
total severance costs were million 
in addition  we recognized million of expenses in fiscal related to stock based compensation  most of which related to stock options which became fully vested upon the termination of employees as a result of the usauto acquisition 
for the year ended june   we also recognized gains on the sale of foreclosed real estate of million versus gains of million in fiscal loss per share on a fully diluted basis for the year ended june  was  as compared to a loss of for the year ended june  the net loss for the year ended june  was net of an income tax benefit of million  while no tax benefit was recognized in fiscal as a result of the uncertainty of its utilization 
pro forma consolidated results on a pro forma basis  net income for the year ended june  was million  versus million for the year ended june  pro forma income per share on a fully diluted basis for the year ended june  was  as compared to for the year ended june  actual results real estate and corporate loss before income taxes for the year ended june  was million versus a loss before income taxes of million for the year ended june  investment income related to cash equivalents decreased to million for the year ended june  versus million for fiscal this decrease is due to lower interest rates and a decrease in the amount of available cash equivalents as a result of the effects of the usauto acquisition 

table of contents gains on sales of foreclosed real estate for the year ended june  were million resulting from the sale of a total of ten parcels  as compared to million for fiscal gains on sales of real estate represents proceeds received from the sale of foreclosed real estate in excess of carrying value  less selling costs 
stock based compensation for the year ended june  was million compared to million for fiscal this increase was primarily the result of recognizing the expense for the immediate vesting  upon his termination  of nonqualified stock options granted to our former president and chief executive officer  donald j 
edwards  for an option to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
additionally  this expense also includes the cost associated with an option to purchase  shares granted to mr 
edwards as a result of the rights offering in accordance with the anti dilution terms of his employment agreement  and options to purchase  shares granted to other former employees 
other operating expenses increased for the year ended june  primarily as a result of the million in severance cost to former employees who were terminated as a result of the usauto acquisition 
pro forma results real estate and corporate on a pro forma basis  income before taxes for the year ended june  was million versus a loss before taxes of million for the year ended june  these results exclude compensation of terminated employees and reflect only the real estate operations and costs related to acquisition opportunities 
actual results insurance operations for the two months included in the operating results for the year ended june   the insurance operations recorded income before taxes of million 
the combined ratio for this period was which was comprised of a loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of and an expense ratio of 
pro forma results insurance operations on a pro forma basis  income before taxes for the year ended june  was million versus million for the year ended june  these results assume that the acquisition had occurred on july  and therefore these results include twelve months of insurance operations 
net premiums earned increased to million for the year ended june  from million for fiscal this increase is primarily related to the fact that more of our insurance business was written through our insurance company subsidiaries than for other insurance companies through our managing general agency operations 
in addition  effective february   we increased our assumed reinsurance percentage from to for our alabama business  which was written through another insurance company since we were not licensed there 
likewise  as a result of shifting the insurance underwriting to our insurance subsidiaries  commissions and fees declined over the same period and ceding commissions from our reinsurer increased 
during the year ended june   the number of retail locations or stores expanded by  increasing from at june  to at june  during the fiscal year ended june   we added stores 
investment income increased as the increase in invested assets more than offset the reduction in yield 
the weighted average investment yield for the portfolio was at june  with a duration of years 
the yield for the comparable lehman brothers indices at june  was the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio improved from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  insurance operating expenses increased from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  such increase is primarily due to the increase in net premiums earned 
insurance operating expenses for the year ended june  did include million in costs incurred by usauto as result of its acquisition by us 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources prior to the usauto acquisition  our historical funding requirements were operating expenses  including legal  audit  and consulting expenses incurred in connection with evaluation of potential acquisition candidates and other strategic opportunities 
our historical primary sources of funding for operating expenses were proceeds from the sales of foreclosed real estate  investment income on cash and cash equivalents  and cash on hand 
since the completion of the usauto acquisition  our liquidity and capital resources have become more reflective of those of a vertically integrated insurance company  performing all sales  servicing and underwriting of non standard personal automobile insurance 
our primary sources of funds are from premiums received  commission and fee income and investment income 
funds are used to pay claims and operating expenses 
operating activities for the year ended june  provided million of cash compared to 
million used in the prior year 
the increase is the direct result of the inclusion of our insurance operations in the current period 
net cash used by investing activities for the year ended june  was million as compared to million used in the prior year 
the fiscal results primarily reflects the additions to our investment portfolio as well as the expended to fund the texas acquisition 
the fiscal results include the net cash of million used in the acquisition of usauto  million of which was provided from the net proceeds of the issuance of stock in a rights offering in april during the year ended june   we increased the statutory capital and surplus of the insurance company subsidiaries by million to support additional premium writings 
at june   we had million available in unrestricted cash and investments outside of the insurance company subsidiaries 
in april  we used million of cash to repay in full our note payable to a financial institution 
this term loan was repaid ahead of its contractual maturity to eliminate interest expense of libor plus basis points 
this prepayment resulted in a million charge related to unamortized loan costs 
as a result of the usauto acquisition  we are now part of an insurance holding company system with substantially all of our operations being conducted by our insurance company subsidiaries 
accordingly  the holding company will only receive cash from operating activities as a result of investment income and the ultimate liquidation of our foreclosed real estate held for sale 
cash could be made available through loans from financial institutions  the sale of common stock  and dividends from the insurance company subsidiaries 
in addition  as a result of our tax net operating loss carryforwards  taxable income generated by the insurance company subsidiaries will provide cash to the holding company through an intercompany tax allocation agreement through which the insurance company subsidiaries will reimburse the holding company for current tax benefits utilized through recognition of the net operating loss carryforwards 
state insurance laws limit the amount of dividends that may be paid from the insurance company subsidiaries 
these limitations relate to statutory capital and surplus and net income 
in addition  the national association of insurance commissioners model act for risk based capital rbc provides formulas to determine the amount of statutory capital and surplus that an insurance company needs to ensure that it has an acceptable expectation of not becoming financially impaired 
a low rbc ratio would prevent an insurance company from paying dividends 
statutory guidelines suggest that the insurance company subsidiaries should not exceed a ratio of net premiums written to statutory capital and surplus of to we believe that the insurance company subsidiaries have sufficient financial resources available to support their net premium writings in both the short term and the reasonably foreseeable future 
we believe that existing cash and investment balances  when combined with anticipated cash flows generated from operations  will be adequate to meet our expected liquidity needs in both the short term and the reasonably foreseeable future 
our growth strategy includes possible acquisitions 
any acquisitions or other growth opportunities may require external financing  and we may from time to time seek to obtain external financing 
we 
table of contents cannot assure you that additional sources of financing will be available to us or that any such financing would not negatively impact our results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements  other than leases accounted for as operating leases in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or financing activities with special purpose entities 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes all of our contractual obligations by period as of june  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands loss and loss adjustment expenses operating leases employment agreements advisory services agreement total contractual cash obligations loss and loss adjustment expense reserves do not have contractual maturity dates  however  based on historical payment patterns  the amount presented is our estimate of the expected timing of these payments 
the timing of these payments is subject to significant uncertainty 
we maintain a portfolio of marketable investments with varying maturities and a substantial amount of cash and cash equivalents intended to provide adequate cash flows for such payments 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
as more information becomes known  these estimates and assumptions could change  thus having an impact on the amounts reported in the future 
the following are considered to be our critical accounting policies valuation of deferred tax asset 
income taxes are maintained in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  whereby deferred income tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences 
temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years 
valuation of the deferred tax asset is considered a critical accounting policy because the determination of our ability to utilize the asset involves a number of management assumptions relating to future operations that could materially affect the determination of the ultimate value and  therefore  the carrying amount of our deferred tax asset 
based on business activity prior to the usauto acquisition  management believed it was more likely than not that we would not realize the benefits of the loss carryforwards 
therefore  a full valuation allowance had been established 
based upon our estimates of our future taxable income after the usauto acquisition  we reduced our deferred tax valuation allowance by million 
further  based upon our revised estimates after considering the actual results for the year ended june   the allowance was reduced by an additional million 
at june   our total gross deferred tax asset is million  and we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million 
on a net basis  the deferred tax asset is million after an allowance of million 
realization of this deferred tax asset is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxable income in the future 
if future taxable income is not sufficient to recover the deferred tax assets  the maximum charge to the provision for income taxes will be million 
if we generate sufficient future taxable income to fully utilize the deferred tax assets as of june   the maximum additional benefit for income taxes will be million 

table of contents losses and loss adjustment expense reserves 
months and sometimes years may elapse between the occurrence of an automobile accident covered by one of our insurance policies  the reporting of the accident and the payment of the claim 
we record a liability for estimates of losses that will be paid for accidents that have been reported  which is referred to as case reserves 
in addition  since accidents are not always reported when they occur  we estimate liabilities for accidents that have occurred but have not been reported  which are referred to herein as incurred but not reported  or ibnr reserves 
we are directly liable for loss and loss adjustment expenses under the terms of the insurance policies that the insurance company subsidiaries underwrite 
each of the insurance company subsidiaries establishes a reserve for all of its unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  including case and ibnr reserves  and estimates for the cost to settle the claims 
we rely primarily on historical loss experience in determining reserve levels  on the assumption that historical loss experience provides a good indication of future loss experience 
we also consider various other factors  such as inflation  claims settlement patterns  legislative activity and litigation trends 
we continually monitor these estimates and as experience develops or new information becomes known  increase or decrease the level of its reserves in the period in which changes to the estimates are determined 
accordingly  the actual losses and loss adjustment expenses may differ materially from the estimates we have recorded 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
the usauto and texas acquisitions resulted in goodwill of million and million  respectively 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
these acquisitions also resulted in other identifiable intangible assets with a current book value of million 
as required by sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
if impairment indicators exist between the annual testing periods  management will perform an interim impairment test 
should either an annual or interim impairment test determine that the fair value of usauto or the texas operations is below the carrying value  a write down of these assets will be required 
in evaluating whether impairment exists  management also considers the fair value in excess of the carrying value for certain assets 
at june   impairment tests were performed and in management s opinion  no impairment exists 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued emerging issues task force eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the guidance applies to all investment securities accounted for under sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
eitf provides guidance in identifying whether an unrealized loss on an investment security should be treated as an other than temporary impairment of the security s recorded value 
among other things  the guidance provides that other than temporary impairment loss recognition would depend on market conditions  management s intent and a company s ability to hold a potentially impaired security for a period sufficient for recovery of the loss 
in september  the fasb delayed the effective date of many provisions of eitf until certain implementation issues could be resolved 
the full impact on our financial statements of eitf will not be determined until the final guidance is available 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  supersedes accounting procedures board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values ie  pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition 
sfas no 
r is effective for public companies at the beginning of the first annual period beginning after june  effective july   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure in and use the fair value method for expensing stock based compensation 
however  we continue to analyze the expected impact of sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have an exposure to interest rate risk relating to fixed maturity investments 
changes in market interest rates directly impact the market value of the fixed maturity securities
