item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management overview we are a biotechnology company conducting business through two wholly owned operating subsidiaries  sentigen biosciences and cmt 
sentigen biosciences has been primarily engaged in the development and commercialization of novel bioassay systems that elucidate the underlying biology of protein protein interactions 
sentigen biosciences has initially targeted its tango tm assay system to address the functionalization of g protein coupled receptors gpcrs for pharmaceutical drug discovery and development 
cmt provides contract research and development services to companies engaged in the drug discovery process 
at cmt  we are expending time and resources to broaden our customer base and our service offerings to the drug discovery community 
at sentigen biosciences  we are spending our time and resources to execute the development and commercialization of the tango assay system 
sentigen biosciences is in the process of devoting a portion of its research effort and resources to the development of a novel molecular profiling system  which if successful  the company will attempt to commercialize 
sentigen biosciences believes that the ability to profile the cross reactivity of lead drug compounds against a wide range of gpcrs in the tango system could result in the generation of selectivity profiles for drug candidates  thereby enabling the identification of more specific drugs with fewer side effects 
the earnings to date generated from our base business at cmt have provided us  in part  with the financial resources to execute our research program at sentigen biosciences 
our continued success in these efforts depends on cmt s ability to broaden its customer base and expand its portfolio of services to the drug discovery community 
to this end  the management team at cmt has spent its time developing its business through trade conferences  exhibition and project collaborations that demonstrate cmt s sophisticated service platform and research products to companies engaged in the drug discovery process 
on february  we sold the assets of specialty media  a division of cmt  for million in cash to serologicals corporation 
accordingly  the assets and liabilities of specialty media have been accounted for as assets and liabilities held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  the statements of operation for specialty media have been accounted for as discontinued operations  net of tax in our consolidated statements of operation 
sentigen biosciences has been primarily focused on research and development  and has participated in various scientific and industry conferences and met with leading pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agricultural companies in an effort to raise awareness of its technologies among constituents in those communities 
sentigen biosciences intends to seek strategic discovery and development partnerships around key molecular targets with biotechnology  pharmaceutical and other life sciences research institutions 
sentigen biosciences has not generated any revenues from these activities and while we have met and continue to meet with these institutions we have not yet entered into any drug discovery or development agreements nor can any assurance be given that we will be able to do so on terms that are acceptable to us 
substantial amounts of additional financing either directly or through partnerships may be required to fully commercialize the systems and research programs undertaken by us 
there is no assurance that such financing can be obtained on reasonable terms 
critical accounting policies sentigen biosciences the operations of sentigen biosciences are reflected as research and development expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
sentigen biosciences operations  since its inception in february  consist entirely of research and development 
research and development costs are expensed as such costs are incurred 
on july   we were awarded a contract by the technical support working group tswg an interagency government office with representatives from the departments of defense  state and homeland security to develop advanced biotechnology for the detection of explosives and other threats 
the contract  entitled olfactory receptor microarray based sensor for explosives detection orm eds  will provide sentigen biosciences with million in research funding through july we are conducting research for the development of a freestanding sensor for the detection of explosive agents 
the sensor is aimed at reproducing the sensitivity  versatility and chemical range of the mammalian nose 
we are attempting to isolate  produce and assemble mammalian olfactory receptors into microarrays that would allow the nano scale monitoring of patterns of olfactory receptor activation resulting from exposure to potentially harmful agents 
the contract provides for the reimbursement of research expenditures plus a fixed profit margin 
through december  we have earned revenues of  under this contract  while incurring total costs of  on august   sentigen biosciences was awarded a federal phase i grant in the amount of  from the national institute of health 
the term of the grant was from september  through february  the grant provided for the direct costs of a specific project within sentigen biosciences overall research program budgeted in the grant for  as well as an allocation for the facilities and administrative costs of sentigen biosciences related to the project budgeted in the grant at 
sentigen biosciences completed the research project covered under the grant and all funds were received from the national institute of health as of december  the receipt of funds under the grant were accounted for as revenue  the direct costs of the project were accounted for as direct costs and the related facilities and administrative costs were shown as operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
cell molecular technologies  inc revenue  income after direct costs also referred to as gross margin on revenues or gross margin and net income are used to measure and evaluate the financial results of cmt 
revenue recognition 
cmt s services are performed on a fee for service  fixed contract basis that provide for payments after specific research milestones are achieved 
revenues for fixed price contracts with a term of less than months are recognized when specific research milestones are achieved 
work in process  representing time and costs incurred on projects in process in excess of amounts billed to customers  are recorded as unbilled services on our consolidated balance sheets 
unearned revenue represents amounts billed in excess of costs incurred and are recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
direct costs 
the major classes of direct costs for cmt are as follows costs incurred for direct materials used in the services performed under research contracts  an allocation of the compensation costs for the time incurred on such contracts by scientists  an allocation of indirect materials costs for general laboratory expenses incurred for the benefit of all contracts in process and an allocation of certain general and administrative expenses incurred by cmt 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
the major classes of selling  general and administrative expenses incurred by cmt are as follows compensation and employee benefit costs of cmt s management  sales  and administrative staff  compensation and employee benefit costs for the time of scientific and production personnel spent on selling  general and administrative activities  facilities rental  utilities  communication costs and related operating expenses  marketing  sales and advertising costs  business travel expenses  commercial and product liability insurance costs  repairs and maintenance costs on facilities and laboratory equipment and professional fees for legal and accounting services 
sentigen holding corp 
the expenses of the parent company  sentigen holding corp 
are reflected as corporate overhead expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and include the following major classes compensation and employee benefits cost for the chairman of the board  chief financial officer  executive vice president of commercial operations and administrative assistant  professional fees for legal and accounting services  office rental  utilities and communication costs  stock market listing fees and other related public company expenses and business travel expenses 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases these estimates and assumptions upon historical experience and existing  known circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
specifically  management must make estimates in the following areas allowance for doubtful accounts 
our consolidated balance sheet includes a reserve against receivables for estimated losses that may result from customers inability to pay 
management determines the amount of the reserve by analyzing uncollectible accounts  aged receivables  and customers creditworthiness 
amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged against this reserve 
to minimize the likelihood of uncollectible accounts  customers creditworthiness is reviewed periodically based on our experience with the customer and external credit services if necessary and adjusted accordingly 
should a customer s account become past due  a hold is generally placed on the account and further services are discontinued to that customer  minimizing further risk of loss 
additionally  all accounts with aged balances greater than one year are fully reserved 
impairment of intangibles 
our intangible assets consist primarily of license costs of  as of december   and are the result of the april  exclusive licensing agreement with the trustees of columbia university 
the value of the license reflects the closing share price of our common stock on april  the closing date of the agreement with the trustees of columbia university multiplied by the  shares of common stock issued to columbia less accumulated amortization 
the value of the license is subject to an amortization period of years 
management reviews the value of the license for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable 
a review for impairment includes comparing the carrying value of the license to an estimate of the undiscounted net future cash inflows over the life of the license 
the license is considered to be impaired when the carrying value exceeds the calculation of the undiscounted net future cash inflows or fair market value 
an impairment loss in the amount of the excess would be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations if the carrying value exceeded the fair market value of the license 
we believe no such loss is necessary as of december stock based compensation 
sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  encourages  but does not require companies to record compensation cost for stock based employee compensation plans at fair value 
we continue to account for stock based compensation to employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
apb no 
requires no recognition of compensation expense for the stock based compensation arrangements provided that the exercise price is equal to the market price at the date of the grants 
options granted to non employees are valued at either the fair value of the consideration received  or the fair value of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measurable 
the expense for options issued to non employees is recorded as stock based compensation in our consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes model requires management to estimate common stock price volatility  risk free interest rates and other parameters in order to determine the fair value of an option grant 
we also adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of sfas no 
deferred tax valuation allowance 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  a deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates which will be in effect when these differences reverse 
we provide a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets unless  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
results of operations comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  were  compared to revenue of  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
for the year ended december   revenues attributable to cmt were  and grew when compared to revenues for the year ended december  the remainder of the increase was primarily the result of the revenues earned by sentigen biosciences under the initiation of our contract with technical support working group tswg an interagency government office with representatives from the departments of defense  state and homeland security to develop advanced biotechnology for the detection of explosives and other threats 
under this contract we earned  during the year ended december  an analysis of the services revenue earned by cmt is as follows for the year ended december  percent change hts contract   all other contracts   total   the services revenue for high throughput screening  or hts  services is derived from one contract with merck co  inc the contract had a term of one year  and ended on december  the contract provided for payments to cmt of  per month in exchange for a fixed number of cell and reagent deliveries to support the customer s hts program 
if actual deliveries during exceeded the fixed number of deliveries provided for in the contract additional deliveries would have been billed at the rate of per delivery 
the contract also provided for a credit against other services in addition to the base contract value performed for the customer in if actual deliveries during fell below the fixed number of deliveries provided for in the contract 
the contract states that the credit against the value of future additional services performed in could not exceed of the value of the additional services performed in addition to the base contract value for at december  unearned revenue totaled  to account for the value of the credit which is due in on march   this contract was renewed on substantially similar same terms for the year ending december   except that additional deliveries in excess of the fixed deliveries provided for in the contract will be billed at the rate of  per delivery 
the increase in other contracts was the result of the study agreement we signed on august   with merck co  inc under the agreement cmt will develop  bank and study certain cell lines based on standards and protocols specified by merck co  inc the agreement provides for total payments to cmt of  under the agreement merck co  inc made up front payments totaling  of those payments  was accounted for as earned revenues during  based on the milestones completed under the agreement  while the remainder is accounted for as customer deposits in our consolidated balance sheet 
the  of revenue earned during was partially offset by a decline in revenue from the completion of a contract which did not renew in income after direct costs and gross margin 
income after direct costs for the year ended december  was  a gross margin on revenue of compared to income after direct costs of  a gross margin on revenue of for the year ended december  this was primarily the result of an increase in direct materials costs at cmt as a percentage of services revenue

operating expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  this increase of  or was primarily the result of the following research and development expenses including the costs under the tswg contract increased  or due to higher professional fees and research expenses at sentigen biosciences associated with the expansion of our research programs  and the initiation of the tswg contract which accounted for  in costs and did not exist during corporate overhead expenses increased  or 
the increase was primarily due to the increased costs associated with a full year of salary and consulting fees paid to our former executive vice president of commercial operations as well as higher professional fees 
depreciation and amortization costs increased  or 
this increase is attributable to depreciation on capital expenditures made by cmt in these increases were partially offset by selling  general and administrative expenses of cmt declined  or due to lower general costs associated with marketing and sales expenses as well as lower consulting and service fees 
a decline in stock based compensation costs of  or 
the decline in stock based compensation results from the one time charge taken in september  as a result of the amendment to a stock option agreement with our chairman of the board  chief executive officer and president 
this decline attributable to this one time charge was partially offset by increases in the fair values of stock options granted to non employee scientific consultants resulting from the increase in the price of our common stock during the three months ended march  loss from continuing operations 
loss from continuing operations for the year ended december  was  compared to a loss from continuing operations of  for the year ended december   an increase of

net interest income increased due to the investment of our cash and cash equivalents in two year us treasury notes during our provision for income taxes increased due to higher state income taxes at cmt 
income from discontinued operation  net of taxes 
income from discontinued operations includes the income from operations of the specialty media division of cmt  net of income taxes 
the division was sold to serologicals corporation on february  for million in cash 
income from discontinued operation  net of tax for the year ended december  increased when compared to the year ended december  the increase is attributable to a increase in revenues augmented by a decline in overhead costs associated with the operation of the divison

revenues for the year ended december  were  compared to revenue of  for the year ended december  this increase of  or  was the result of an increase of  or  in services revenue from cmt  offset  in part  by a decrease of  or in grant revenues from sentigen biosciences 
our consolidated revenues in were entirely attributable to the operations of cmt 
an analysis of the services revenue earned by cmt is as follows for the year ended december  percent change hts contract   all other contracts   total   the services revenue for high throughput screening  or hts  services is derived from a retainer contract 
the contract provided for payments of  per month  regardless of the volume of services performed during the month 
the term of the contract was for one year and ended on december  the increase in the revenues received under the contract resulted from the increase in hts services required by the customer to support its hts programs during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the growth in services revenue from other contracts was driven by mouse genetics services and protein expression services 
income after direct costs and gross margin 
income after direct costs for the year ended december  was  a gross margin on revenue of compared to income after direct costs of  a gross margin on revenue of for the year ended december  operating expenses 
operating expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  this increase of  or was primarily the result of the following selling  general and administrative expenses of cmt increased  or due to higher commercial insurance expenses  higher compensation expenses and higher marketing and sales expenses 
research and development expenses increased  or due to higher professional fees and research expenses at sentigen biosciences 
corporate overhead expenses increased  or 
the increase was primarily due to the increased costs associated with the hiring of our executive vice president of commercial operations and increased professional fees for legal services 
an increase in stock based compensation costs of  the increase in stock based compensation results from the september  amendment to a stock option agreement with our chairman of the board  chief executive officer and president 
the stock option is for the purchase of  shares of our common stock at per share and was originally granted on may  the stock option is fully vested and would have expired on april  the amendment extended the life of the option to april  all other terms of the stock option agreement remain unchanged 
as a result of this amendment and according to fasb interpretation no 
to apb opinion no 
we recognized stock based compensation in the amount of  these increases were partially offset by a decrease of  in depreciation and amortization expenses 
loss from continuing operations 
loss from continuing operations for the year ended december  was  compared to a loss from continuing operations of  for the year ended december   an increase of 
the breakdown of our net loss from continuing operations for the years ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is as follows for the year ended december  percent change income from operations provided by cmt   loss from operations of sentigen biosciences   parent company expenses   net interest income   provision for income taxes   total   the increased income from operations provided by cmt was driven by its increase in revenues 
the revenue increase was augmented by reduced selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue 
the loss from operations of sentigen biosciences increased due to higher research costs and professional fees 
the loss from holding company expenses increased by due to the additional stock based compensation of  recognized for the extension of the life of a stock option previously granted to our chairman of the board  chief executive officer and president and the additional costs associated with the hiring of our executive vice president of commercial operations 
interest income  net of interest expenses declined due to the decline in yields on us treasury and money market securities  in which we invest our available cash 
income from discontinued operation  net of taxes 
income from discontinued operations includes the net income of the specialty media division of cmt  net of income taxes  which was sold to serologicals corporation on february  for million in cash 
income from discontinued operation  net of tax for the year ended december  increased when compared to the year ended december  the increase was generally attributable to price increases implemented in the division 
liquidity and capital resources at december  we had  in cash and cash equivalents and  invested in us treasury notes 
our working capital as of december  was  during the year ended december  we financed our operations through working capital and capital expenditures primarily through a commercial bank loan and a capital lease 
on february   we purchased a  face value   us treasury note  maturing on january  with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the specialty media division 
on may  we purchased a  face value  us treasury note maturing on may  on october  we purchased a  face value  us treasury note maturing on september  these purchases account for the majority of the  decline in cash and cash equivalents reported in our consolidated statement of cash flow for the year ended december on january  we sold  face value  us treasury notes maturing on october  the proceeds from the sale were reinvested in day us treasury bills 
capital gains recognized from the transaction were minimal 
this sale accounts for the majority of the  increase in cash and cash equivalents reported in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
we believe that our financial resources will be sufficient to fund operations and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  substantial amounts of additional financing either directly or through partnerships may be required to fully commercialize the systems and research programs undertaken by us 
there is no assurance that such financing can be obtained on reasonable terms 
it is possible that any such financing may be dilutive to current stockholders and the terms of any debt financings likely could contain restrictive covenants limiting our ability to do certain things  including paying dividends 
our ability to obtain financing depends upon the status of future business prospects  as well as conditions prevailing in the capital markets 
sentigen biosciences sentigen biosciences was formed in february of and is focusing on research and development activities 
the licensing agreement with columbia that we entered into in april required us to contribute a minimum of  into sentigen biosciences within one year of the date of the agreement by april or we must have been involved in active negotiations to raise  in additional funding 
we satisfied this provision through the consummation of a private placement in november in which we sold  shares of our common stock at per share for aggregate gross proceeds of  another provision of the agreement required that a minimum of  per six month period or  per annual period be spent on bona fide research and development of the patents and licenses subject to the agreement from the second through the fourth years of the agreement april through april or we must have been involved in active negotiation to raise  in additional funding 
we satisfied this provision through april on may  we entered into a second license agreement with columbia for the exclusive license to columbia s rights under patent applications developed jointly by us and columbia in the area of assaying receptor activity 
in consideration of the may  exclusive license agreement  we agreed to the following we will pay columbia a royalty totaling of the net sales received by us on any products developed by us and approved by the food drug administration fda 
we will also pay to columbia a royalty totaling of any payments received by us on any products approved by the fda that were developed pursuant to sublicenses of our rights under the patents 
we are also obligated to spend the following on the research and development of products under the patents a minimum of  from may  through december  and a minimum of  per year for calendar years through for the period from may  through december  we spent approximately  on the research and development of products under the patents 
there is no assurance that the technology related to the licensing agreements with the trustees of columbia university or other technologies involved in the research and development activities of sentigen biosciences will prove to be productive 
in the event we decide to terminate such activities  there will be associated costs to us  such as payment to employees and expenses related to the closing of its facility at broadway  new york  new york 
no provisions have been made for such possible further expense 
cell molecular technologies  inc on august  cmt borrowed  under a  commercial bank loan commitment to finance capital expenditures 
we are required to pay interest at the prime rate on principal amounts borrowed during the first year of the promissory note 
at the conclusion of the first year of the promissory note july  a principal repayment schedule will be negotiated and the interest rate will become fixed 
on october  cmt borrowed an additional  under this loan commitment 
on december  we borrowed an additional  under the commitment 
in april  cmt leased equipment for use in the provision of services under certain contracts 
the lease qualified for treatment as a capital lease for accounting purposes 
at the inception of the lease  equipment and an offsetting capital lease liability was recorded on our consolidated balance sheet in the amount of  we used a fixed interest rate of to approximate the borrowing rate for the lease 
the equipment is being depreciated on a straight line basis through the term of the lease which expires in march rental payments for the year ended december  totaled  of those payments   was applied to the capital lease liability and  was applied to interest expense 
as of december  the total remaining obligation under this lease amounted to  commitments under debt obligations and leases we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of and for the year ended december  as of december   the scheduled maturities of our indebtedness were amount due by period less than grater than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations      capital lease obligations    operating lease obligations    total      inflation we historically offset the impact of inflation through price increases 
periods of high inflation could have a material adverse impact on us to the extent that increased borrowing costs for floating rate debt may not be offset by increases in cash flow 
there was no significant impact on our operations as a result of inflation during the years ended december   and recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
among other items  sfas no 
r eliminates the use of apb and the intrinsic value method of accounting  and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards  in the financial statements 
the effective date of sfas no 
r for the company is the third quarter of sfas no 
r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective method  or a modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after that date  and based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r 
under the modified retrospective method  the requirements are the same as under the modified prospective method  but also permits entities to restate financial statements of previous periods  either for all prior periods presented or to the beginning of the fiscal year in which the statement is adopted  based on previous pro forma disclosures made in accordance with sfas no 
the company has not yet determined which of the methods it will use upon adoption 
the company currently utilizes the black scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
while sfas no 
r permits entities to continue to use such a model  it also permits the use of a lattice model 
the company expects to continue using the black scholes option pricing model upon adoption of sfas no 
r to measure the fair value of stock options 
the adoption of this statement will have the effect of reducing net income and income per share as compared to what would be reported under the current requirements 
these future amounts cannot be precisely estimated because they depend on  among other things  the number of options issued in the future  and accordingly  the company has not determined the impact of adoption of this statement on its results of operations 
sfas no 
r also requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date 
these future amounts cannot be estimated  because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of sfas no 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
sfas no 
was effective for the year ended december  the following table reconciles net loss and diluted earnings per share eps  as reported  to pro forma net loss and diluted eps  as if we had expensed the fair value of employee stock options as permitted by sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes on our us treasury securities  money market securities and variable rate bank debt 
we are not currently exposed to any foreign currency risks 
other information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk is set forth in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents  us treasury securities and long term debt 
we generally invest our excess cash in us treasury securities of short to intermediate term and money market mutual funds 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates  and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates prior to maturity 
at december   we had total debt of  this debt consists of three capital leases and three commercial bank notes used for equipment financing 
the payment commitments under these debt instruments are comprised of interest and principal payments 
we may incur additional interest expense over the repayment period with increases in the prime rate of interest 
on february   in connection with the sale of cmt s specialty media division to serologicals corp 
nasdaq sero  the real property and mortgage on marshall street was disposed of 
on february   sentigen biosciences renegotiated the interest rate on its equipment loan maturing april from a fixed rate of to a variable interest rate 
the variable interest rate is the prime rate of interest plus with a minimum interest rate of 
on april   cmt renegotiated the interest rate on its equipment loan  maturing may from a fixed rate of to a fixed rate of 
the amortization period of the loan remained unchanged
