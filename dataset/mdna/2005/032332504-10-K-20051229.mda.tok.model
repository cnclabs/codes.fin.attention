item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to facilitate an understanding of our business and results of operations 
this md a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report

overview we operate in two segments 
our semiconductor equipment segment is a leading supplier of horizontal diffusion furnace systems  including related automation  parts and services  to the semiconductor  mems microelectromechanical system  silicon wafer and solar cell industries 
our polishing supplies and equipment segment is a leading supplier of insert carriers to manufacturers of silicon wafers 
the polishing segment also manufacturers polishing templates  steel carriers and double sided polishing and lapping machines to fabricators of optics  quartz  ceramics and metal parts  and to manufacturers of medical equipment components 
in july  we completed the acquisition of the bruce technologies horizontal diffusion furnace product line from kokusai semiconductor equipment corporation ksec  which we believe makes us the leading manufacturer of horizontal diffusion furnaces 
during the second half of fiscal  we shipped our first two small batch vertical furnace systems 
a significant loss on the first of these systems was recorded primarily in fiscal nearly an equal amount of revenue and costs related to these two systems have been deferred until acceptance  which we expect to occur in fiscal we have increased the refurbishing and resale of our own brands of used diffusion furnaces in order to remain competitive in the entire market for these products 
while we do not sell equipment with a repurchase obligation and thus have no repurchase obligations with our customers  we sometimes purchase used equipment for inventory on a strategic  opportunistic basis  to allow us to offer customers an alternative when price is the primary consideration 
we generally limit such advance purchases to available  well maintained  used equipment that has been or shortly will be taken out of production 
when customers decide to relocate their production  we offer to decommission their furnaces and reinstall them in the new facility 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated years ended september  net revenues cost of sales gross margin selling  general and administrative research and development operating income loss interest income expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax benefit net income loss fiscal compared to fiscal the following table presents certain key highlights and the percentage change in the results of operations for the fiscal compared to fiscal in thousands  except percentages

net revenues the following table reflects the increase in net revenues during as compared to in thousands  except percentages years ended september  increase in thousands of dollars semiconductor equipment segment polishing supplies segment net revenues net revenues from bruce technologies products and services  acquired july   accounted for million  or  of the increase in net revenues of the semiconductor equipment segment during fiscal  compared to fiscal the million increase in the polishing supply segment was primarily due to increased penetration into foreign markets with insert carriers for polishing semiconductor wafers 
amtech s business was subject to cyclical industry conditions in fiscal  and as a result of these conditions  there were significant fluctuations in quarterly new orders  shipments and revenue  both within and across years 
the following table reflects trends in consolidated new orders  shipments and net revenues for each quarter during the current fiscal year and for our prior two fiscal years  and the backlog as of the end of those periods 
this table also includes these amounts for the full year in total and for each or our two business segments fiscal quarter fiscal year semi conductor equipment segment polishing supplies segment first second third fourth dollars in thousands new orders shipments net revenues ending backlog book to bill ratio new orders shipments net revenues ending backlog book to bill ratio new orders shipments net revenues ending backlog book to bill ratio amounts include the bruce technologies horizontal furnace product line of kokusai acquired july  for the periods subsequent to the acquisition 
orders are net of cancellations and include the change in the u 
s 
dollar value of orders recorded in euros by our semiconductor equipment segment 
the backlog as of september   includes million of deferred revenue for which there is an equal amount of deferred costs  ie with no gross margin to be realized 
net new orders in fiscal increased to million  compared to million in and our previous record of million in fiscal bruce technologies product lines acquired july  contributed million to the increase 
most of the increase in new orders occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal  during which million of new orders were booked  matching the previous record in the third quarter of fiscal since we ended the year with a significantly larger backlog  we are expecting higher revenue in fiscal gross margin our gross margin was million in fiscal  an increase of compared to fiscal the semiconductor equipment segment contributed million of the increase 
the increase in both segments was driven primarily by the increased revenues discussed above 
however  improved profitability of those sales  as measured by the margins as a percent of revenue  also contributed to the increase in gross margin 
gross margin for  as a percent of revenue increased in the polishing segment  to from in  and in the semiconductor equipment segment  to from in  and on a consolidated basis  to  from in performing the laser cutting operation in house  rather than incurring the higher cost of subcontracting the work to others  is the primary cause for the increase in the margin percentage in the polishing segment 
approximately million of the improvement in the fiscal gross margin resulted from the recognition in of profit deferred by the semiconductor equipment segment in prior years pursuant to our revenue recognition policy 
while there was a small increase in the amount of revenue deferred during the year compared to fiscal  there was very little deferred cost associated with the deferred revenue recognized in in contrast  a significant portion of the revenue deferred in fiscal to later years was from the first two small batch vertical furnaces delivered during the year for which we deferred million of both revenue and costs 
for information on the components of deferred profit as of the end of fiscal years and  refer to revenue recognition in note to the consolidated financials statements 
another factor contributing to the improvement in the gross profit percentage of the semiconductor segment was a reduction in the amount of inventory write downs to million in  as compared to million in  resulting from increased operating activities 
discontinuation of an automation product contributed to the inventory write downs in fiscal the higher write offs in are primarily due to approximately million of excess inventory acquired from kokusai written down from the value at which it was included in the audited financial statements of the acquired business 
sales of inventory written down in prior periods were not significant 
the timing of revenue recognition has a particularly significant effect on gross margin when the equipment revenue of an order is recognized in one period and the remainder of the revenue attributed to installation  generally of the order  is recognized in a later period  because the latter revenue has a significantly higher gross margin percentage 
selling  general and administrative expenses total selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in fiscal  or  compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to the bruce technologies acquisition which added million of sg a 
additional increases include increased audit fees of million and increased commissions and royalties of million  resulting from higher sales representative commissions and the increased sales of insert carriers 
research and development expenses development work on the small batch vertical furnace product line was the primary factor in the million increase in research and development expenses during fiscal compared to the prior year 
operating loss operating loss decreased significantly in fiscal to million  compared to a loss of million in fiscal as can be seen from the segmented income statement above  most of the improvement resulted from the polishing segment million  resulting from increased revenue and savings from performing in house a manufacturing step previously outsourced 
changes in deferred profit million in fiscal relative to  the profit from the bruce technologies product line million and other improvements in the semiconductor equipment segment million  primarily from the reduction in inventory write downs  accounted for the remaining improvement in operating income loss 
income tax expense 
our income tax provision was million higher in fiscal than in  because it was in that we provided an allowance for all of our deferred tax assets 
our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors  such as tax legislation  the geographic composition of our pre tax income  the level of expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 
as we recognize profits  we will offset the income tax expense by the reversal of the valuation allowance  up to the current tax expense  until fully reversed or until it has been determined the valuation allowance is no longer needed 
despite the book loss before income taxes  we incurred some alternative minimum tax and were taxable in certain states  which resulted in a provision for income taxes of million 
fiscal compared to fiscal the following table presents certain key highlights and the percentage change from the results of operations for the fiscal years ended september  and in thousands  except percentages 
due to the significant changes resulting from changes in deferred profit and from the acquisition of bruce technologies  the following table segregates these amounts 
all other changes are segregated by segment in the table and are discussed below 
fiscal year change in deferred profit bruce acquis

net revenues the following table reflects the increase or decrease in net revenues during as compared to in thousands  except percentages years ended september  inc dec in thousands of dollars semiconductor equipment segment polishing supplies segment net revenues our net revenues for were million  compared to million in and million in  representing decreases of in and in our netherlands operation accounted for approximately of consolidated net revenues and of the net revenues of the semiconductor equipment segment in and  respectively 
our netherlands operation records all transactions in euros  its functional currency  which in turn are translated into united states us dollars  our reporting currency 
the euro increased in value relative to the us dollar in both and as a result of the decline in the value of the us dollar  consolidated net revenues  and those of the semiconductor equipment segment  were approximately million and million higher in and  respectively than they would have been had the exchange rates remained the same as the weighted average exchange rates for however  the increasing value of the euro made it more difficult to obtain orders in asia  leading to an decline in that region s percentage contribution to consolidated net revenue  offsetting approximately million of the increase in net revenue just described 
shipments increased by million in  compared to  as a result of approximately million of additional sales from the bruce technologies product line acquired in the fourth quarter 
however  changes in deferred revenue more than offset the increase in consolidated shipments and resulted in the million decline in revenue of the semiconductor equipment segment 
net revenues of the polishing supplies segment increased by million  primarily for consumables 
while the acquisition of bruce technologies increased the semiconductor equipment net revenues by million  the remaining semiconductor equipment net revenues decreased by million 
our semiconductor equipment segment accounted for and of net revenues in and  respectively 
this segment also accounted for and of the operating loss in and the semiconductor and optical component industries cycles peaked during and reached bottom in the semiconductor industry began to improve during  with new orders net of cancellations from this segment reaching million  the second highest in the history of our semiconductor equipment segment 
however  this segment s business began to soften again in  when new orders  excluding those acquired with the bruce technologies product line  declined 
again  the strong euro relative to the us dollar caused the cost of our products manufactured in europe to be higher than those of competitors with production in the united states and asia 
over of our products have been produced in europe over the past three years 
the semiconductor equipment segment s net revenues were million and million in and  respectively  representing a decline in revenue in although shipments increased by million in to million  from million in  revenue declined in by million primarily due the million increase in the amount of revenue deferred as a result of additional customer caused delays in completing installations and obtaining acceptances 
certain post shipment factors that affect our timing of the recognition of revenue are discussed above 
also  see revenue recognition in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of our revenue recognition policy and the components of deferred profit 
revenues of the polishing supplies segment reached a record million in  as the semiconductor industry reached the peak of its business cycle 
this segment reached the bottom of the ensuing cyclical downturn during  before increasing slightly to million in and by another to reach million in increased revenues in and resulted mainly from increased sales of insert carriers 
the increase in insert carrier revenue accounted for of the increase in polishing supplies revenue in gross margin consolidated gross margin for was million  compared to million in  representing a decrease of million  or  in in  the gross margin of the semiconductor equipment segment decreased by million  or  primarily due to charges for a million write down of inventories and million of estimated future losses on the sale of a small batch vertical furnace being designed and manufactured under a contract in cooperation with a significant customer in the electronics industry 
the million increase in the deferral of profit on four systems resulting from customer delays in site preparation contributed to the decline in the gross margin of the semiconductor equipment segment 
the gross margin of the polishing supplies segment increased by million  or  in due to the increased revenue and the improvement in that segment s gross margin percentage  discussed below 
as a percentage of net revenues  the consolidated gross margin was in and in the million of gross margins that were deferred in on a nearly equal amount of deferred revenue  compared to the recognition of million of deferred net revenue in accounts for approximately of the decline in gross margins as a percentage of revenue 
pursuant to our inventory valuation accounting policy  we valued the acquired inventories  as of the date of the bruce technologies acquisition  at million less than the value at which the seller carried those inventories  and charged that amount to cost of sales 
as a result  write downs of excess or obsolete inventory were million higher in  compared to  and accounted for of the decline in gross margin as a percentage of revenues in compared to in and  development of a small batch vertical furnace pursuant to a customer purchase order was our most significant project 
however  because this system is being built to a customer specification and order  the only significant incremental costs related to this development project were the million of costs in excess of the selling price  which were accounted for as additional cost of sales  representing another of the decline in our gross margin percentage 
these factors were only partially offset by the improved margins of the polishing supplies segment  which resulted from spreading fixed costs over that segment s higher revenue 
our gross margin has significantly fluctuated in the past and will continue to fluctuate in the future based on several factors including  but not limited to  the severity and duration of industry cycles  the timing of revenue recognition under evolving accounting principles  product mix and overhead absorption levels 
selling  general and administrative expenses consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  compared to million in the semiconductor equipment segment accounted for million of the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  which is attributable to the addition of bruce technology in the fourth quarter of fiscal million  and increases in selling personnel and related costs million  administrative personnel costs million  other selling costs  such as advertising and trade shows million  foreign currency transaction losses million and other general and administrative expenses million 
in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses increased due to the rise in the dollar value of euro denominated expenses incurred in the netherlands as a result of the change in the rate used to translate those costs million and to a lesser extent travel and other costs associated with the due diligence on and integration of the recent acquisition of bruce technologies  which were partially offset by a million decline in commissions as a result of a decline in sales through sales representatives  particularly in china 
the remaining increase in selling  general and administrative costs in is attributable to the polishing supplies segment  primarily resulting from commissions and royalties on higher sales of insert carriers 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased dramatically in to from in  partially because bruce technologies selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately of its revenue as a result of certain transition costs that have since been eliminated through the centralization of back office functions and because the increases in expenditures for the other operations described above did not result in proportionately greater revenue 
research and development expenses during and  expenditures accounted for as research and development were million and million  respectively 
the primary reason for the decline in research and development from to is that the costs include certain preliminary conceptual development costs that were incurred on the small batch vertical furnace  discussed above  prior to receipt of the customer order and thus were expensed 
subsequent to the receipt of the customer s order  we employed contract accounting and treated the subsequent costs as inventory  which we carried at the lower of cost or market until the furnace shipped in june operating loss reduced revenues and gross margins and increased selling  general and administrative costs in resulted in an operating loss of million or of revenue  compared to an operating loss of million  or of revenue  in the operating loss is primarily comprised of increases in selling  general and administrative expenses  described above  million of operating profit deferred on the four systems that were delivered to a customer during the second and  third quarters  but on which installation could not be completed due to customer delays  million of inventory write downs primarily related to inventory acquired along with the bruce technologies product line  and million of anticipated losses recorded on a customer contract  representing our investment in the development of a small batch vertical diffusion furnace that has the potential to generate significant revenues in the future 
income tax provision during we recorded an income tax provision of million 
the provision includes a charge for million resulting from a valuation allowance for the total deferred tax assets at september  in contrast to  we recorded an income tax benefit of million in excluding the charge of million for the valuation allowance  the effective tax rate as a percentage of income loss before income taxes was in and in the lower rate in compared to is the result of permanent differences as a percentage of pre tax loss being lower in than in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for income taxes sfas requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
a review of all available positive and negative evidence needs to be considered  including a company s performance  the market environment in which the company operates and the length of carry back and carryforward periods 
sfas further states that forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
therefore  cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment 
as a result of the review undertaken at september   we concluded that it was appropriate to establish a full valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets 
our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors  such as tax legislation  the geographic composition of pre tax income  non tax deductible expenses and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 
net loss as a result of the operating results described above  resulted in a net loss of million  compared to the net loss of million for net loss per diluted share was  in and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources at september   cash and cash equivalents were million  an increase of million from september   primarily from the net proceeds from the april issuance of  shares of convertible preferred stock which raised million 
our current ratio was at september  as compared to at september  during fiscal  cash from million in additional long term borrowings was used primarily to make million in payments on long term obligations and to fund the purchase of million of property  plant and equipment 
working capital increased by million to million at september  from million at september  this increase was primarily due to the proceeds from the preferred stock offering in april and is reflected in the million reduction in deferred profit and the million increase in prepaid expenses  primarily prepaid insurance and prepayments to certain vendors 
another change within the components of working capital was a million increase in net receivables resulting from higher sales volume in the fourth quarter of fiscal  compared to the same period of fiscal the increase in receivables was offset by million of cash generated from decline in inventories during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  resulting from shipment of the first small batch vertical furnace and increased sales  primarily in the semiconductor equipment business 
however  due to a million order  which is due to ship in march  we expect that inventories will increase during the first quarter of fiscal during this time we will closely monitor cash disbursements 
we have been able to sustain cash flows through collections of receivables and slowing payments on certain payables 
we will continue these activities over the next several months 
at september   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents 
due to the significant increase in backlog and particularly the million  six system order  all of which is due to ship during march  we expect our liquidity position to decline significantly until we receive the first payment in april as a result  we continue to hold approximately million in cash and cash equivalents as of december  we expect that we will secure a line of credit in january  however  if we do not secure the line of credit  we believe we will have sufficient liquidity for our operations 
however  there can be no assurance of either 
we expect working capital to be constrained until april due to cash required to produce our backlog 
however  beyond april  we believe that we have sufficient sources of liquidity for our operations and for certain elements of our growth strategy 
one element of our growth strategy is the development of new products  such as continued process development for and improvements to the new small batch vertical model for our diffusion furnace line 
another element of our growth strategy is the acquisition of product lines or businesses that complement our existing product lines and business 
significant unplanned development of new products or the completion of significant acquisitions will require additional capital 
historically we have obtained capital from one or more sources of financing  such as private placement of equity  public stock offerings  working capital loans or term loans from banks or other financial institutions  equipment leasing  mortgage financing and internally generated cash flow 
additional capital resources may include one or more of these sources of financing 
however  there can be no assurance of the availability or sufficiency of these or any other source of funding for those purposes 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we have the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of september  in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt obligations operating lease obligations buildings office equipment vehicles total operating lease obligations purchase obligations total other commerical obligations bank guarantees preferred stock dividends total other commercial obligations operating leases primarily include leases for offices  factories and office equipment throughout our operations 
purchase obligations represent agreements to purchase goods and services consisting of outstanding purchase orders for goods and services 
while the amount above represents purchase agreements the actual amounts to be paid may be less in the event that any agreements are renegotiated  cancelled or terminated 
at september   the company s netherlands based subsidiary had million of guaranty lines of credit in place with its bank 
the lines of credit are used to guaranty customer deposits on certain contracts and to fund our european operations 
if the company were unable to perform its contractual obligations to which the customer deposits relate  it could be required to perform under these guaranties 
at september   the company has guaranties of million outstanding under the guaranty lines of credit 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  accounts receivable collectibility  warranty and impairment of long lived assets 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates and judgments form the basis for making conclusions about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations  and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these uncertainties are discussed in the section below entitled trends  risks and uncertainties 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we review product and service sales contracts with multiple deliverables to determine if separate units of accounting are present in the arrangements 
where separate units of accounting exist  revenue is allocated to delivered items equal to the total sales price less the greater of the relative fair value of the undelivered items  and all contingent portions of the sales arrangement 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered and title has transferred  or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for us  this policy generally results in revenue recognition at the following points for the semiconductor equipment segment  transactions where legal title passes to the customer upon shipment  we recognize revenue upon shipment for those products where the customer s defined specifications have been met with at least two similarly configured systems and processes for a comparably situated customer 
however  a portion of the revenue associated with certain installation related tasks  equal to the greater of the relative fair value of those tasks or the portion of the contract price contingent upon their completion  generally of the system s selling price the holdback  and directly related costs  if any  are deferred and recognized into income when the tasks are completed 
since we defer only those costs directly related to installation or other unit of accounting not yet delivered and the portion of the contract price is often considerably greater than the fair market value of those items  our policy at times will result in deferral of profit that is disproportionately greater than the deferred revenue 
when this is the case  the gross profit recognized in one period will be lower and the gross profit reported in a subsequent period will improve 
for products where the customer s defined specifications have not been met with at least two similarly configured systems and processes  the revenue and directly related costs are deferred at the time of shipment and recognized into income at the time of customer acceptance or when this criterion has been met 
we have  on occasion  experienced longer than expected delays in receiving cash from certain customers pending final installation or system acceptance 
if some of our customers refuse to pay the final payment  or otherwise delay final acceptance or installation  the deferred revenue would not be recognized  adversely affecting our future operating results 
equipment sold by the polishing supplies segment does not include process guarantees  acceptance criteria or holdbacks  therefore  the related revenue is recorded upon transfer of title which is generally at time of shipment 
our shipping terms for both segments are customarily fob our shipping point or equivalent terms 
for all segments  sales of spare parts and consumables are recognized upon shipment  as there are no post shipment obligations other than standard warranties 
service revenues are recognized upon performance of the services requested by the customer 
revenue related to service contracts is recognized ratably over the period of the contract or in accordance with the terms of the contract  which generally coincides with the performance of the services requested by the customer 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
we currently have significant deferred tax assets resulting from expenses not currently deductible for tax purposes  revenues recognized for tax purposes but deferred for financial statement purposes and net operating loss carryforwards that will reduce taxable income in future periods 
during  we established a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and recognized a million income tax expense 
sfas no 
requires a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
it also states that it is difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
therefore  the cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment 
inventory valuation 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out method or net realizable value 
we regularly review inventory quantities and record a write down for excess and obsolete inventory 
the write down is primarily based on historical inventory usage adjusted for expected changes in product demand and production requirements 
however  our industry is characterized by customers in highly cyclical industries  rapid technological changes  frequent new product developments and rapid product obsolescence 
while the inventories acquired in the bruce technologies transaction will require several years to consume in production and through spare parts sales  management believes the write downs taken are sufficient to protect against future losses  as this product line is receiving greater attention under its current ownership 
changes in demand for our products and product mix could result in further write downs 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance is based on historical experience  credit evaluations and specific customer collection history and any customer specific issues we have identified 
since a significant portion of our revenues are derived from the sale of high value systems  our accounts receivable are often concentrated in a relatively few number of customers 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
warranty 
we provide a limited warranty  generally for to months  to our customers 
a provision for the estimated cost of providing warranty coverage is recorded upon shipment of all systems 
on occasion  we have been required and may be required in the future to provide additional warranty coverage to ensure that the systems are ultimately accepted or to maintain customer goodwill 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and we believe that the amounts accrued for warranty expenditures are sufficient for all systems sold through september   we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience a similar level of predictability with regard to warranty costs 
in addition  technological changes or previously unknown defects in raw materials or components may result in more extensive and frequent warranty service than anticipated  which could result in an increase in our warranty expense 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the estimated useful lives of long lived assets or intangible assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable 
goodwill is also tested for impairment at least annually 
when factors indicate that an asset should be evaluated for possible impairment  we use an estimate of the related undiscounted net cash flows generated by the asset over the remaining estimated life of the asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable 
we make judgments and estimates used in establishing the carrying value of long lived or intangible assets 
those judgments and estimates could be modified if adverse changes occurred in the future resulting in an inability to recover the carrying value of these assets 
we have not experienced any impairment to long lived assets during or future adverse changes could be caused by  among other factors  a downturn in the semiconductor industry  a general economic slowdown  reduced demand for our products in the marketplace  poor operating results  the inability to protect intellectual property or changing technologies and product obsolescence
