item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the historical consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 
overview we are a fully integrated  self administered and self managed real estate investment trust  or reit 
we are one of the nation s largest owners of neighborhood and community shopping centers 
as of december   we had a shopping center portfolio consisting of shopping centers  located in states and totaling approximately million square feet of gla  of which approximately million square feet was company owned gla 
our shopping center portfolio was approximately leased as of december  our operating strategy is to own and manage a quality portfolio of community and neighborhood shopping centers that will provide stable cash flow and investment returns 
our focus is to own primarily grocer anchored centers with a diverse and multi anchored tenant base in attractive geographic locations with strong demographics 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from rentals and recoveries received from tenants under existing leases on each of our properties 
our operating results therefore depend primarily on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments 
generally  we do not expect that our net operating income  a non gaap measure  will deviate significantly in the short term 
this is because our leases with our tenants provide us a stable cash flow over the long term 
in addition  other than in circumstances such as higher than anticipated snow removal costs  utility expenses  insurance costs or real estate taxes  our operating expenses generally remain predictable 
however  as an owner of community and neighborhood shopping centers  our performance is linked to economic conditions in the retail industry in those markets in which our centers are located 
the retail sector continues to change dramatically as a result of continued industry consolidation due to the continuing strength of wal mart and large retail bankruptcies in the recent past resulting in an excess amount of available retail space  fewer national tenants  and greater competition 
we believe that the nature of the properties that we primarily own and invest in grocer anchored neighborhood and community shopping centers provides a more stable revenue flow in uncertain economic times  as they are more resistant to economic down cycles 
this stability is due to the fact that consumers still need to purchase food and other goods found at grocers  even in difficult economic times 
in the face of these challenging market conditions  we follow a dual growth strategy 
first  we continue to focus on increasing our internal growth by leveraging our existing tenant relationships to improve the performance of our existing shopping center portfolio 
we believe that there are meaningful opportunities to increase our cash flow from our existing properties because of their desirable locations 
for instance  during   and the first quarter of  we were adversely affected by large retail bankruptcies that created vacant space within our portfolio and by the increasingly competitive leasing environment resulting from the economic downturn during the early part of this decade 
however  as a result of our efforts to re let space  including space recovered from bankrupt tenants  as well as the improvement in the overall performance of our portfolio and improving economic conditions within our markets  we experienced an increase of approximately in our same property net operating income during excluding lease termination activity 
we anticipate our same property net operating income during will be consistent with our performance during during  in order to re let vacant space within our portfolio  we incurred higher non recurring capital expenditures than in prior periods as we re positioned several of our centers for future growth 
in addition  we anticipate incurring additional non recurring capital expenditures during as we seek further opportunities to reposition vacant space 
secondly  we focus on achieving external growth by the expansion of our portfolio and we will continue to pursue targeted acquisitions of multi anchored  primarily by grocers  neighborhood and community shopping centers in attractive markets with strong economic and demographic characteristics 
we will pursue acquisitions in our existing markets as well as in new markets  including where a portfolio of properties might be available to enable us to establish a platform for further growth 
in recent years  the market for acquisitions has been particularly competitive with a greater number of potential buyers pursuing fewer properties 
the low interest rate environment and reduced costs of funds have further served to dramatically increase prices paid for shopping center properties 
as a result  during  our effort to expand our portfolio through acquisition was adversely affected 
we expect that as long as the interest rate environment continues to be favorable to buyers  this competitive acquisition environment will continue 
as a means of increasing our access to potential acquisitions and alternative sources of capital to fund future acquisitions  we are pursuing joint venture arrangements with third party developers and institutional investors 
we completed our first joint venture arrangement with a third party developer during the second quarter of however  with respect to joint venture arrangements with third party developers  in most cases  we do not anticipate that we will recognize the full economic benefit of such arrangements for years 
in  as a means of increasing our external growth  we also expect to aggressively pursue additional growth capital for acquisitions through strategic joint ventures with institutional investors 
in the near future  to take advantage of favorable market conditions  we intend to dispose of properties that are not a strategic fit within our overall portfolio 
the disposition of shopping center properties may lead to short term decreases in net operating income 
however  we intend to offset any such decreases by re investing the proceeds of such sales to grow our existing portfolio  whether through acquisition or joint venture 
we may also use these sale proceeds to reduce our overall outstanding indebtedness  improving the quality of our balance sheet 
during  as reflected below  our general and administrative expenses have been higher than anticipated as a result of increased staffing  various business initiatives aimed at future growth  the increased costs associated with being a public company and unanticipated severance costs 
in particular  the costs associated with the company s review of its internal controls to ensure compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act have been significantly higher than expected 
we expect these increased non severance general and administrative costs to continue during we currently expect to incur additional debt in connection with future acquisitions of real estate 
as of december   we had billion of indebtedness  of which approximately million was unsecured indebtedness 
although we expect to assume additional secured debt in connection with the acquisition of real estate  in the future  we intend to finance our operations and growth primarily through borrowings under our line of credit facility  unsecured private or public debt offerings or by additional equity offerings 
we may also pursue joint venture arrangements aimed at providing alternative sources of capital 
in addition  our existing unsecured line of credit matures on april  in february  we obtained a commitment to establish a new three year  million unsecured line of credit with wachovia bank  as agent 
wachovia has agreed to use its best efforts to syndicate this new line of credit 
this new line of credit  which we expect to enter into shortly  will replace our existing unsecured credit facility 
in the event we are unable to enter into this new line of credit on or before april   we would seek an extension of our existing line of credit for up to one year 
in addition  in light of our investment grade credit ratings and prior capital markets activity  we believe there are sufficient alternative financing sources available to us to refinance our existing line of credit  including through a combination of one or more short term bridge loans  public or private offerings of common stock  preferred stock or debt securities or the incurrence of additional indebtedness through secured or unsecured borrowings 
critical accounting policies we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition and the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  real estate investments including purchase price allocations and asset impairment  and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risks 
we state these accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis 
our estimates are based on information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates and those estimates could be different under varying assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition rental income with scheduled rent increases is recognized using the straight line method over the term of the leases commencing when the tenant takes possession of the space 
the aggregate excess of rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis over cash received under applicable lease provisions is included in accounts receivable 
in addition  leases for both retail and office space generally contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse us for a portion of property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred by us  requiring us to estimate the amount of revenue from these recoveries 
such recoveries revenue is recorded based on management s estimate of its recovery of certain operating expenses and real estate tax expenses  pursuant to the terms contained in related leases 
in addition  certain of our operating leases for retail space contain contingent rent provisions under which tenants are required to pay a percentage of their sales in excess of a specified amount as additional rent 
we defer recognition of contingent rental income until those specified targets are met 
we must make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable related to minimum rent  deferred rent  expense reimbursements and other revenue or income 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  tenant concentrations  tenant creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in our tenant payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
these estimates have a direct impact on our net income  because a higher bad debt allowance would result in lower net income 
real estate investments at our formation in july  contributed real estate investments were recorded at the carry over basis of our predecessor  which was fair market value of the assets in conformity with gaap applicable to pension funds 
subsequent acquisitions of real estate investments  including those acquired in connection with our acquisition of bradley in september and other acquisitions since our formation  are recorded at cost 
expenditures that substantially extend the useful life of a real estate investment are capitalized 
expenditures for maintenance  repairs and betterments that do not materially extend the useful life of a real estate investment are charged to operations as incurred 
the provision for depreciation and amortization has been calculated using the straight line method over the following estimated useful lives land improvements years buildings and improvements years tenant improvements shorter of useful life or term of related lease we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to our properties 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income because if we were to shorten the expected useful life of our properties or improvements  we would depreciate them over fewer years  resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis during these periods 
we apply statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  to recognize and measure impairment of long lived assets 
we review each real estate investment for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a real estate investment may not be recoverable 
the review of recoverability is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows  excluding interest charges  expected to result from the real estate investment s use and eventual disposition 
these cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds estimated fair market value  resulting in a lower net income 
no such impairment losses have been recognized to date 
real estate investments held for sale are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value  less cost to sell 
depreciation and amortization are suspended during the period held for sale 
we apply statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  to property acquisitions 
accordingly  the fair value of the real estate acquired is allocated to the acquired tangible assets  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases  other value of in place leases and value of tenant relationships  based in each case on their fair values 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and the as if vacant value is then allocated based on management s determination of the relative fair values of these assets 
management determines the as if vacant fair value of a property using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers 
factors considered by management in performing these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  management includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease up periods based on current market demand 
management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions  legal and other related costs 
the as if vacant value is then allocated amongst land  land improvements  building  and building improvements based on the company s estimate of replacement costs 
in allocating the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property  above market and below market in place lease values are recorded based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the lease 
the capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
the capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the initial term and any fixed rate renewal periods in the respective leases 
the aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets  consisting of in place leases and tenant relationships  is measured by the excess of i the purchase price paid for a property after adjusting existing in place leases to market rental rates over ii the estimated fair value of the property as if vacant  determined as set forth above 
this aggregate value is allocated between in place lease values and tenant relationships  if any  based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease  however  the value of tenant relationships has not been separated from in place lease value for the additional interests in real estate entities because such value and its consequence to amortization expense is estimated to be immaterial for these particular acquisitions 
should future acquisitions of properties result in allocating material amounts to the value of tenant relationships  an amount would be separately allocated and amortized over the estimated life of the relationship 
the value of in place leases exclusive of the value of above market and below market in place leases is amortized to expense over the remaining non cancelable periods of the respective leases 
if a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration  all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be written off 
hedging activities from time to time  we use derivative financial instruments to limit our exposure to changes in interest rates 
we were not a party to any hedging agreement with respect to our floating rate debt as of december  or we have in the past used derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risks related to our borrowings  from lines of credit to medium and long term financings 
we require that hedging derivative instruments are effective in reducing the interest rate risk exposure that they are designed to hedge 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors 
if interest rate assumptions and other factors used to estimate a derivative s fair value or methodologies used to determine hedge effectiveness were different  amounts reported in earnings and other comprehensive income and losses expected to be reclassified into earnings in the future could be affected 
results of operations the following discussion is based on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december    and from january  through december   we increased our total portfolio of properties after reflecting dispositions from properties to properties and from million company owned gla to million company owned gla 
as a result of this growth of our total portfolio  the financial data presented below with respect to the total portfolio shows significant changes in revenues and expenses from period to period and  as a result  we do not believe our period to period financial data  with respect to the total portfolio are comparable in any meaningful way 
therefore  the comparison of operating results for the years ended december    and show changes resulting from net operating income for properties that we owned for each period compared we refer to this comparison as our same property portfolio for the applicable period and the changes for income before net gains attributable to our total portfolio 
unless otherwise indicated  increases in revenue and expenses attributable to the total portfolio are due to the acquisition of properties during the years being compared 
in addition  amounts classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are excluded from the total portfolio information 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  the table below shows selected operating information for our total portfolio and the properties acquired prior to january  that remained in the total portfolio through december   which constitute the same property portfolio for the years ended december  and in thousands same property portfolio total portfolio increase decrease change increase decrease change rental and recovery revenue rentals      percentage rent     recoveries      other property     total rental and recovery revenue    expenses property operating expenses    real estate taxes     net operating income    add interest and other income  deduct depreciation and amortization    interest    general and administrative    income before net gains   for a detailed discussion of net operating income  including the reasons management believes noi is useful to investors  and a reconciliation of noi to a gaap measure  see page the increase in rental revenue  including termination fees  for our same property portfolio is primarily the result of a decrease in the provision for allowance for doubtful accounts of million and an increase in minimum rent of million offset by a decrease of million from termination fee income net of termination buyout costs 
a lower provision was required for the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  as a result of a decrease in large tenant bankruptcies and recoveries of amounts previously written off 
minimum rent increased as a result of new leases and rollovers of existing tenants at higher rental rates 
although our weighted average actual occupancy on a same property basis declined slightly to as of december  from as of december   the new leasing activity offset any loss of rental income related to the decrease in weighted average occupancy 
percentage rent revenue decreased for our same property portfolio primarily due to the loss of four anchor tenants with significant percentage rent components comprising million as well as the uncertainty of realization that certain tenant sales thresholds have been met 
recoveries revenue increased for our same property portfolio primarily due to an overall increase in real estate tax recovery income of million  a decrease in the provision for allowance for doubtful accounts of million and an increase in property operating expense recovery income and other reimbursement income of million 
real estate recovery income increased primarily as a result of an increase in real estate tax expense as well as an increase in the real estate tax expense recovery rates due to true ups related to the improved annual reconciliation process 
property operating expense recovery income increased primarily as a result of an increase in the property operating expense recovery rates due to true ups related to the annual reconciliation process offset by a decrease in reimbursable property operating expenses 
property operating expenses decreased primarily as a result of a million lease buy out expense recorded in the prior year  a million decrease in insurance expense  and a million decrease in snow removal and related costs 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in maintenance and supervision expense and a million increase in utility expense 
real estate tax expense increased primarily as a result of increased valuations assessed for certain properties primarily located in the mid west 
interest expense increased due to the issuance of million of unsecured notes payable  higher average balances under the company s line of credit  and an increase in mortgage loans payable as a result of the assumption of debt from various property acquisitions offset by a decrease due to the repayment of million of bonds payable 
overall  the weighted average interest rate remained relatively constant in as compared with the company s weighted average effective interest rate was at december  as compared with at december  our general and administrative expenses  consisting primarily of salaries  incentive compensation  employee benefits  insurance and other corporate level expenses increased for the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  this increase resulted from higher salary and incentive compensation expense due to a larger workforce  including the retention of two additional senior officers responsible for joint venture initiatives and as corporate counsel  and the replacement of stock options to be issued to senior management by the issuance of additional restricted shares of substantially equal value 
the company also incurred higher expenses associated with being a public company  including compliance with the sarbanes oxley act 
in addition  office expenses increased due to the company s relocation of its corporate office in february these increased costs were partially offset by million less severance costs for the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  comparison of the year ended december  to year ended december  the table below shows selected operating information for our total portfolio and the properties acquired prior to january  that remained in our total portfolio through december  which constitute the same property portfolio for the years ended december  and

although our actual occupancy on a same property basis declined to as of december  from as of december   this new leasing activity offset any loss of rental income related to i new vacancies and bankruptcies  primarily ames  kmart and fleming and ii additional charges to bad debts of million 
percentage rent revenue decreased for our same property portfolio primarily due to the loss of three anchor tenants with significant percentage rent components comprising million as well as the difference from the prior year timing of notification that sales thresholds have been met 
recoveries revenue remained relatively flat for our same property portfolio primarily due to an overall increase in property operating and real estate tax expenses offset by lower recovery rates resulting from higher vacancies 
recovery rates for recoverable property operating expenses decreased to from and recovery rates for real estate taxes decreased to from 
the decrease in recovery rates for property operating expenses and real estate taxes is due to higher vacancies  including the loss of anchor tenants whose parcels were separately assessed and paid by the former tenants directly to the taxing authority 
other property revenue decreased primarily as a result of the timing of notification that sales thresholds have been met for tax incentive financing revenue 
property operating expenses increased primarily as a result of million of snow removal costs associated with heavy snowfall across the portfolio during the first few calendar months of and december and million of lease buyout expense incurred in real estate tax expense increased primarily as a result of an increase in tax rates across the portfolio  particularly those properties located in illinois as well as additional tax expense related to the vacancy of certain anchor tenants who paid their property taxes directly to the taxing authorities 
interest expense decreased due to lower average interest rates throughout the year as the company s weighted average effective interest rate decreased to at december  from at december  this decrease was offset by an increase in mortgage loans payable as result of the assumption of debt from various property acquisitions 
general and administrative expenses decreased primarily as a result of lower stock compensation expense incurred in than in during  we incurred million of stock compensation expense from the amortization of stock grants made by the company in and and anticipated to be made by the company in  which included the reimbursement of taxes paid by one employee and million of accelerated stock compensation expense in connection with the departure of a former senior officer 
in  we also incurred million of additional compensation expense related to the departure of a former senior officer 
during  we incurred million of stock compensation expense from the amortization of stock grants made by the company  which included the reimbursement of taxes paid by two employees 
included in stock compensation expense was million of expense incurred by us as a result of the accelerated vesting of all previously granted restricted shares upon completion of our ipo 
excluding stock compensation expense and severance costs  our general and administrative expenses  consisting primarily of salaries  incentive compensation  employee benefits  insurance and other corporate level expenses increased by million in this increase consisted primarily of higher salary and incentive compensation expense due to a larger workforce and higher expenses associated with being a public company for the entire fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in available cash and cash equivalents 
as a reit  we are required to distribute at least of our taxable income to our stockholders on an annual basis 
therefore  as a general matter  it is unlikely that we will have any substantial cash balances that could be used to meet our liquidity needs 
instead  these needs must be met from cash generated from operations and external sources of capital 
at december   we had billion of indebtedness 
this indebtedness has a weighted average interest rate of with an average maturity of years 
as of december   our market capitalization was billion  resulting in a debt to total market capitalization ratio of approximately 
short term liquidity requirements our short term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our properties  including recurring maintenance capital expenditures necessary to properly maintain our properties  interest expense and scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness  capital expenditures incurred to facilitate the leasing of space at our properties  including tenant improvements and leasing commissions  and future distributions paid to our stockholders 
we incur maintenance capital expenditures at our properties  which include such expenses as parking lot improvements  roof repairs and replacements and other non revenue enhancing capital expenditures 
maintenance capital expenditures were approximately million  or per square foot  for the year ended december  we have also incurred and expect to continue to incur revenue enhancing capital expenditures such as tenant improvements and leasing commissions in connection with the leasing or re leasing of retail space 
we believe that we qualify and we intend to continue to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code 
as a reit  we are allowed to reduce taxable income by all or a portion of our distributions paid to shareholders 
we believe that our existing working capital and cash provided by operations will be sufficient to allow us to pay distributions necessary to enable us to continue to qualify as a reit 
however  under some circumstances  we may be required to pay distributions in excess of cash available for those distributions in order to meet these distribution requirements  and we may need to borrow funds  most likely under our line of credit  to pay distributions in the future 
historically  we have satisfied our short term liquidity requirements through our existing working capital and cash provided by our operations as well as with borrowings under the company s line of credit facility 
we believe that our existing working capital and cash provided by operations should be sufficient to meet our short term liquidity requirements 
cash flows provided by operating activities decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash flows from operations is primarily attributable to the combined effect of a million increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of completion of the annual reconciliation process and a million increase in prepaid and other assets  offset by a million increase in net income 
there are a number of factors that could adversely affect our cash flow 
the continuation of an economic downturn in one or more of our markets may impede the ability of our tenants to make lease payments and may impact our ability to renew leases or re lease space as leases expire 
in addition  an economic downturn or recession could also lead to an increase in tenant bankruptcies  increases in our overall vacancy rates or declines in rents we can charge to re lease properties upon expiration of current leases 
in all of these cases  our cash flow would be adversely affected 
as of december   the company had six tenants operating under bankruptcy protection  the largest of which is rhodes furniture 
the leases directly impacted by these bankruptcy filings totaled approximately of our annualized base rent for all leases in which tenants were in occupancy at december  in addition  subsequent to december   one additional tenant  winn dixie stores inc  representing of our annualized base rent filed for bankruptcy protection 
on april   fleming filed for bankruptcy protection 
as part of this bankruptcy  fleming s motion to reject leases at three of our fleming store locations was allowed by the bankruptcy court on that date 
the three rejected leases aggregated approximately  square feet and represented approximately of total annualized base rent for all leases in which tenants were in occupancy on march  in june  leases at four of our store locations aggregating  square feet were assumed by fleming and assigned to roundy s  inc  as part of roundy s acquisition of rainbow foods 
in december  a fifth lease was assumed by knowlan s food 
a motion filed with the bankrupcty court to permit three leases to be assumed by fleming and assigned to a third party independent grocer was allowed in september the two remaining leases  aggregating  square feet were rejected on march  during the fourth quarter of  we sold one of the remaining fleming locations and leased two other fleming locations to a national tenant 
we are actively pursuing tenants to lease the two remaining locations 
any future bankruptcies of tenants in our portfolio  particularly major or anchor tenants  may have additional negative impact on our operating results and cash flows 
long term liquidity requirements our long term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for scheduled debt maturities  renovations  expansions and other non recurring capital expenditures that need to be made periodically to our properties  and the costs associated with acquisitions of properties that we pursue 
historically  we have satisfied our long term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital  including our existing working capital  cash provided by operations  long term property mortgage indebtedness  our credit facility  bridge financing  and through the issuance of debt and equity securities 
we believe that these sources of capital will continue to be available to us in the future to fund our long term liquidity requirements 
in addition  we also intend to pursue additional capital for acquisitions through strategic joint ventures with institutional investors 
however  there are certain factors that may have a material adverse effect on our access to these capital sources 
our ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors  including our degree of leverage  the value of our unencumbered assets  our credit rating and borrowing restrictions imposed by existing lenders 
currently  we have a credit rating from three major rating agencies standard poor s  which has given us a rating of bbb  moody s investor service  which has given us a rating of baa  and fitch  which has given us a rating of bbb  all three have stated the outlook as stable 
a downgrade in outlook or rating by a rating agency can occur at any time if the agency perceives adverse change in our financial condition  results of operations or ability to service our debt 
in addition  our existing unsecured line of credit matures on april  in february  we obtained a commitment to establish a new three year  million unsecured line of credit with wachovia bank  as agent 
this new line of credit  which we expect to enter into shortly  will replace our existing unsecured credit facility 
in the event we are unable to enter into this new line of credit on or before april   we would seek an extension of our existing line of credit for up to one year 
in addition  in light of our investment grade credit ratings and prior capital markets activity  we believe there are sufficient alternative financing sources available to us to refinance our existing line of credit  including through a combination of one or more short term bridge loans  public or private offerings of common stock  preferred stock or debt securities or the incurrence of additional indebtedness through secured or unsecured borrowings 
based on our internal evaluation of our properties  the estimated value of our properties exceeds the outstanding amount of mortgage debt encumbering those properties as of december  therefore  at this time  we believe that additional funds could be obtained  either in the form of mortgage debt or additional unsecured borrowings 
in addition  we believe that we could obtain additional financing without violating the financial covenants contained in our unsecured public notes 
our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity securities is dependent upon  among other things  general market conditions for reits and market perceptions about us 
we will continue to analyze which source of capital is most advantageous to us at any particular point in time  but the equity markets may not be consistently available on terms that are attractive or at all 
environmental matters we currently have approximately eighteen properties in our portfolio that are undergoing or have been identified as requiring some form of remediation including monitoring for compliance to clean up contamination 
in some cases  contamination has migrated into the groundwater beneath our properties from adjacent properties  such as service stations 
in other cases  contamination has resulted from on site uses by current or former owners or tenants  such as gas stations or dry cleaners  which have released pollutants such as gasoline or dry cleaning solvents into soil and or groundwater 
based on our experience with properties in our portfolio  we believe the cost of remediation for contamination resulting from dry cleaning pollutants will range from approximately  to  per property  and the cost of remediation for contamination from gasoline pollutants will range from approximately  to  per property 
any failure to properly remediate the contamination at our properties may result in liability to federal  state or local governments for damages to natural resources or liability to third parties for property damage or personal injury and may adversely affect our ability to operate  lease or sell that property 
of the approximately eighteen properties cited above  half of those properties were contributed to us by net realty holding trust  our largest stockholder  upon our formation in july these contributed properties together with approximately ten other contributed properties for which no remediation is currently taking place are the subject of an indemnity arrangement under which net realty holding trust has agreed to indemnify us against environmental liabilities up to million in the aggregate 
since our formation  we have been reimbursed by net realty holding trust for approximately million of environmental costs pursuant to this indemnity 
although we do not believe that the aggregate indemnity amount will be needed  we believe that net realty holding trust has the ability to perform under its indemnity up to the aggregate amount 
in addition  each of the properties for which we are actively pursuing remediation to clean up contamination is covered by this indemnity 
with respect to the remaining properties cited above not covered by the net realty holding trust indemnity  no clean up activities are currently taking place and our requisite on going responsibilities are to monitor those properties for compliance and to determine if any remediation or other action may be required in the future 
we believe that the costs of monitoring these properties are not material  individually or in the aggregate  to our financial condition and we have established reserves for such costs 
contractual obligations  contingent liabilities  and off balance sheet arrangements all of our indebtedness is disclosed in our consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this report

the indebtedness described in the table above  including our line of credit  will require principal amortization and balloon payments  of million in it is likely that we will not have sufficient funds on hand to repay these balloon amounts at maturity 
we currently expect to refinance this debt by obtaining a new line of credit  through unsecured private or public debt offerings  through additional debt financings secured by individual properties or groups of properties or through additional equity offerings 
we may also refinance future balloon payments through borrowings under our unsecured credit facility 
as of december   we have future contractual payment obligations relating to construction contracts  ground leases  and leases for the rental of office space as follows in thousands thereafter total construction contracts tenant improvement obligations  ground leases       office leases       total       we have various existing service contracts with vendors and utility contracts related to our property management

these contracts are generally for one year or less and include terms that provide for termination with insignificant or no cancellation penalties 
we have entered into one off balance sheet arrangement 
during the second quarter of  we entered into a joint venture agreement with a third party for the development and construction of a shopping center 
under the joint venture agreement  at any time subsequent to the second anniversary of the completion of the shopping center  which is estimated to occur in the spring of  we may be required to purchase the third party s joint venture interest 
the purchase price for this interest would be at the estimated fair market value 
this contingent obligation is not reflected in the table above 
the repayment obligations reflected in the above table do not reflect interest payments on debt 
in addition  we have obligations under a retirement benefit plan  which are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report  and which are not included in the above table 
funding requirements for retirement benefits after cannot be estimated due to the significant variability in the assumptions required to project the timing of future cash payments 
we have fully guaranteed the repayment of a million construction loan obtained by the joint venture from key bank  national association 
the key bank loan matures in november subject to extension 
as of december   million is outstanding under the construction loan 
such amount is recorded on the books and records of the joint venture 
in the event we are obligated to repay all or a portion of the construction loan pursuant to the guarantee  we i may remove the manager of the joint venture for cause and terminate all agreements with the manager  ii would receive a promissory note from the joint venture for the amount paid by us together with a first priority mortgage on the shopping center  and iii may prohibit all distributions from the joint venture or payment of fees by the joint venture until the principal and accrued interest on the loan is repaid 
the estimated fair value of the guarantee as of december  is not material to our financial position 
accordingly  no liability or additional investment has been recorded related to the fair value of the guarantee 
existing line of credit on april   the company entered into a three year million unsecured line of credit with a group of lenders and fleet national bank  as agent 
our two operating partnerships are the borrowers under the line of credit and we  and certain of our other subsidiaries  have guaranteed this line of credit 
this line of credit is being used principally to fund growth opportunities and for working capital purposes 
at december   million was outstanding under the line of credit 
our ability to borrow under this line of credit is subject to our ongoing compliance with a number of financial and other covenants 
this line of credit  except under some circumstances  limits our ability to make distributions in excess of of our annual funds from operations 
in addition  this line of credit bears interest at either the lender s base rate or a floating rate based on a spread over libor ranging from basis points to basis points  depending upon our debt rating 
in addition  this line of credit has a facility fee based on the amount committed ranging from to basis points  depending upon our debt rating  and requires quarterly payments 
the variable rate in effect at december   including the lender s margin of basis points and borrowings outstanding at the base rate was 
we believe we are in compliance with all of the financial covenants under this line of credit 
however  if our properties do not perform as expected  or if unexpected events occur that require us to borrow additional funds  compliance with these covenants may become difficult and may restrict our ability to pursue some business initiatives 
in addition  these financial covenants may restrict our ability to pursue particular acquisition transactions  including for example  acquiring a portfolio of properties that is highly leveraged 
these constraints on acquisitions could significantly impede our growth 
new line of credit in february  we obtained a commitment to establish a three year  million unsecured line of credit with wachovia bank  as agent 
wachovia has agreed to use its best efforts to syndicate this line of credit 
this new line of credit  which we expect to enter into shortly  will replace our existing unsecured credit facility  which matures on april  we intend to use this new line of credit principally to fund growth opportunities and for working capital purposes 
this new line of credit will bear interest at a floating rate based on a spread over libor ranging from basis points to basis points  including a facility fee  depending upon our debt rating 
based on our current debt rating  we anticipate this new line of credit will bear interest at a floating rate over libor of basis points  including the facility fee 
our ability to enter into this new line of credit is subject to final approval and satisfactory completion by the lender of its due diligence and preparation and execution of an acceptable credit agreement 
we cannot assure you that we will enter into this new line of credit or that wachovia will be successful in syndicating this line of credit up to million 
in the event we are unable to enter into this new line of credit on or before april   we would seek an extension of our existing line of credit for up to one year 
in addition  in light of our investment grade credit ratings and prior capital markets activity  we believe there are sufficient alternative financing sources available to us to refinance our existing line of credit  including through a combination of one or more short term bridge loans  public or private offerings of common stock  preferred stock or debt securities or the incurrence of additional indebtedness through secured or unsecured borrowings 
debt offerings heritage notes we have outstanding two series of unsecured notes 
these notes were issued pursuant to the terms of two separate but substantially identical indentures we entered into with lasalle national bank  as trustee

bradley notes prior to our acquisition of bradley real estate  inc bradley  bradley op completed the sale of three series of senior  unsecured debt securities 
we repaid in full one of these series of bradley op debt securities upon maturity in november these debt securities were issued pursuant to the terms of an indenture and three supplemental indentures entered into by bradley op with lasalle national bank  as trustee  beginning in the indenture and two supplemental indentures contain various covenants  including covenants which restrict the amount of indebtedness that may be incurred by bradley op and those of our subsidiaries which are owned directly or indirectly by bradley op

we believe bradley op is in compliance with all applicable covenants 
equity financings in april  we completed our initial public offering and sold  shares of our common stock at a price of per share resulting in net proceeds to us of million 
we used the net proceeds of the ipo to repay outstanding indebtedness 
in connection with our ipo  all shares of our series a cumulative convertible preferred stock and redeemable equity then outstanding converted automatically into shares of our common stock on a one for one basis 
in december  we completed a secondary public offering of our common stock and sold a total of  shares at a net price of per share  resulting in net proceeds to us of million 
we used the net proceeds of this offering to repay outstanding indebtedness 
funds from operations we calculate funds from operations in accordance with the best practices described in the april national policy bulletin of the national association of real estate investment trusts  referred to as nareit  and nareit s white paper on funds from operations 
the white paper defines funds from operations as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from extraordinary items and sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
given the nature of our business as a real estate owner and operator  we believe that ffo is helpful to investors as a starting point in measuring our operational performance because it excludes various items included in net income that do not relate to  or are not indicative of  our operating performance  such as gains or losses from sales of real estate investments and depreciation and amortization  which can make periodic and peer analyses of operating performance more difficult 
however  ffo i should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our financial performance  ii is not an alternative to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity  and iii is not indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make distributions 
our computation of ffo may differ from the methodology utilized by other equity reits to calculate ffo and  therefore  may not be comparable to other reits 
the following table reflects the calculation of funds from operations and a reconciliation of funds from operations to net income  the most directly comparable gaap measure  for the periods indicated in thousands year ended december  net income    add deduct depreciation and amortization real estate related continuing operations    discontinued operations pro rata share of unconsolidated joint venture depreciation net gains on sales of real estate investments and equipment  preferred stock distributions  accretion of redeemable equity funds from operations    funds from operations for the year ended december  have been restated to exclude the million loss on prepayment of debt  which was previously reported as an extraordinary item  from the reconciliation pursuant to the adoptions of fasb no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  in related party transactions we have in the past engaged in and currently engage in a number of transactions with related parties 
the following is a summary of ongoing transactions with related parties that may significantly impact our future operating results

subsequent to december   ahold usa sold bi lo and bruno s representing million of annualized base rent in equity offering in december  we completed a secondary public offering of our common stock and sold a total of  shares 
net realty holding trust exercised its contractual preemptive right and purchased approximately of the shares we sold in the offering on the same terms as third parties purchased shares 
dartmouth street joint venture in november  we entered into a joint venture with nett for the acquisition and development of a  square foot commercial office building at dartmouth street  boston  massachusetts 
this joint venture is owned by nett and by us 
we were issued this interest as part of a management arrangement with the joint venture pursuant to which we will manage the building 
we have no ongoing capital contribution requirements with respect to this office building  which was completed in january the first tenants began occupying this office building in january we account for our interest in this joint venture using the cost method and we have not expended any amounts on the office building through december  in february  we entered into an eleven year lease with our joint venture with nett for the lease of approximately  square feet of space and we moved our corporate headquarters to this space during the first quarter of under the terms of this lease  which were negotiated on an arms length basis  we began paying rent to the joint venture in february we pay million per year in minimum rent through and million per year from through boston office lease in  nett and net realty holding trust entered into an agreement providing for the lease by nett of  square feet of space in an office building at boylston street for its boston offices 
net realty holding trust assigned this lease to us as part of our formation 
the current term of this lease expires on march  and under this lease  nett pays us  per year in minimum rent 
nett has informed us that they are not renewing this lease 
contingencies legal and other claims we are subject to legal and other claims incurred in the normal course of business 
based on our review and consultation with counsel of those matters known to exist  including those matters described on page  we do not believe that the ultimate outcome of these claims would materially affect our financial position or results of operations 
recourse loan guarantees in addition to our unsecured line of credit and unsecured debt securities we and bradley op have issued  we have fully guaranteed the repayment of a million construction loan obtained by our lakes crossing joint venture from key bank  national association 
the key bank loan matures in november subject to extension 
non recourse loan guarantees in connection with the bradley acquisition  we entered into a special securitized facility with prudential mortgage capital corporation pmcc pursuant to which million of collateralized mortgage backed securities were issued by a trust created by pmcc 
the trust consists of a single mortgage loan due from a subsidiary we created  heritage spe llc  to which we contributed of our properties 
this loan is secured by all properties we contributed to the borrower 
in connection with the securitized financing with pmcc  we entered into several indemnification and guaranty agreements with pmcc under the terms of which we agreed to indemnify pmcc for various bad acts of heritage spe llc and with respect to specified environmental liabilities with respect to the properties contributed by us to heritage spe llc 
we also have agreed to indemnify other mortgage lenders for bad acts and environmental liabilities in connection with other mortgage loans that we have obtained 
inflation inflation has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our properties 
however  many of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
these provisions include clauses enabling us to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants gross sales above pre determined thresholds  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
these escalation clauses often are at fixed rent increases or indexed escalations based on the consumer price index or other measures 
many of our leases are also for terms of less than ten years  which permits us to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal 
in addition  most of our leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance costs  real estate taxes and insurance 
this reduces our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no

r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recorded as an expense based on their fair values 
the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using an option pricing model adjusted for any unique characteristics of a particular instrument 
if an equity award is modified after the grant date  incremental compensation cost will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification 
the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
r to have a material impact on the company s results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchange of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
 sfas no 

the amendments made by sfas no 
are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured on the fair value of assets exchanged 
sfas no 
eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
sfas no 
is effective for nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on the company s results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
net operating income net operating income  or noi  is a non gaap financial measure equal to net income available to common shareholders the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  plus accretion of redeemable equity  preferred stock distributions  income allocated to minority interests in bradley op  net derivative losses gains  losses from prepayment of debt  general and administrative expense  depreciation and amortization  and interest expense  less income from discontinued operations  gains losses on sales of real estate investments and marketable securities  interest and other income  preferred stock distributions and accretion of redeemable equity 
we use noi internally  and believe noi provides useful information to investors  as a performance measure in evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets 
this is because noi reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level and excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property s results of operations 
our presentation of noi may not be comparable to noi reported by other reits that define noi differently 
we believe that in order to obtain a clear understanding of our operating results  noi should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements 
noi should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions 
the following sets forth a reconciliation of noi to net income available to common shareholders for the fiscal years through dollars in thousands 
years ended december  net operating income     add interest and other   gain on sale of marketable securities gains on sales of real estate investments   income from discontinued operations    gains on sales of discontinued operations   net derivative gains deduct depreciation and amortization     interest      general and administrative     loss on prepayment of debt  income allocated to exchangeable limited partnership units income allocated to series b and c preferred units   net derivative losses  net income      deduct preferred stock distributions    accretion of redeemable equity net income loss attributable to common shareholders  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from adverse changes in market prices  interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk  which is sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control 
our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates 
the following table presents our fixed rate debt obligations  at their carrying values  sorted by maturity date and our variable rate debt obligations sorted by maturity date in thousands total estimated fair value weighted average interest rate secured debt fixed rate      variable rate  unsecured debt fixed rate     variable rate   total      if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt outstanding at december  increase by  or basis points  the increase in interest expense would decrease future earnings and cash flows by million annually 
we were not a party to any hedging agreements with respect to our floating rate debt as of december  we have  in the past  used derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risks related to our borrowings  from lines of credit to medium and long term financings 
we require that hedging derivative instruments be effective in reducing the interest rate risk exposure that they are designed to hedge 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors 
we do not believe that the interest rate risk represented by our floating rate debt is material as of december  in relation to total assets and our total market capitalization
