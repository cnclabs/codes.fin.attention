item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations general below  the use of many of the products distributed by the company is being disputed in various forums 
dependence on key and foreign suppliers 
the company is dependent on a relatively small number of suppliers 
although alternative suppliers exist for substantially all products distributed by the company  the loss of any one supplier could have a material adverse effect on the company until alternative suppliers are located and have commenced providing products 
in fiscal  approximately of the products distributed by the company were manufactured in the united states or canada and approximately were imported directly or indirectly from manufacturers in asia 
as a result  the company s operations are subject to the customary risks of doing business abroad  including  among other things  transportation delays  political instability  currency fluctuations and the imposition of tariffs  import and export controls and other non tariff barriers including changes in the allocation of quotas  as well as the uncertainty regarding future relations between china and taiwan 
shipping 
the company s operations are dependent on a continued source of supply of the many automotive body parts which are presently only available from taiwan 
these products are transported to the united states aboard container ships which dock primarily in the los angeles  california area 
any disruption in shipping for any prolonged period  such as might result from an act of terrorism or labor strike  would likely have a material adverse impact on the company s sales and earnings 
hostilities between china and taiwan could also have an adverse impact on the company s source of supply 
in addition  contracts with shipping companies are negotiated on an annual basis normally beginning in april 
the recently negotiated contracts do not reflect any material price increases but a material increase in shipping rates could adversely impact the company s results of operations 
finally  because of the increase in global shipping  the company is concerned that sufficient containers may not be available to transport inventory 
delays in receiving needed inventory could have a material adverse impact on the company 
decline in the number of collision repairs 
the number of collision repairs has declined in recent years  and may continue to do so in the future 
the decline in the number of vehicles being repaired is due to  among other things  automotive safety improvements  more rigorous enforcement of stricter drunk driving laws resulting in fewer accidents and the increase in unit body construction and higher collision repair costs resulting in a larger number of automobiles being declared a total loss in lieu of being repaired 
recent innovations such as impact detection devices available on certain vehicles could also result in fewer collisions 
the continuation of such decline may have a material adverse effect on the company 
compliance with government regulations  environmental hazards 
the company is subject to increasing restrictions imposed by various federal  state and local laws and regulations 
various state and federal regulatory agencies  such as the occupational safety and health administration  the epa and the united states department of transportation  have jurisdiction over the company s operations with respect to matters including worker safety  community and employee right to know laws  and laws regarding clean air and water 
under various federal  state and local laws and regulations  an owner or lessee of real estate or the operator of a business may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on or in  or emanating from  property owned or used in the business  as well as related costs of investigation and property damage 
such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner  lessee or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances 
other than as described below with respect to its bumper plating operations  the company does not currently generate substantial hazardous waste in the ordinary course of its business 
the company believes that it currently is in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  and is not aware of any material environmental problem at any of its current or former facilities 
no assurance can be given  however  that the company s prior activities or the activities of a prior owner or operator of an acquired service center or other facility did not create a material environmental problem for which the company could be responsible or that future uses or conditions including  without limitation  changes in applicable laws and regulations will not result in material environmental liability to the company 
furthermore  compliance with legislative or regulatory changes may cause future increases in the company s operating costs or otherwise adversely affect operations 
certain of the company s products  such as paints and solvents  are highly flammable 
accordingly  the storage and transportation of these materials expose the company to the inherent risk of fire 
the company acquired north star s bumper plating operations in march and midwest bumper s plating operations in march the company previously conducted similar operations at sites  of which were closed between and and one of which was closed in the company s bumper plating operations  which use a number of hazardous materials  are subject to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations relating to environmental matters  including the release of hazardous materials into the air  water and soil 
the company endeavors to ensure that its bumper plating operations comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
to date  compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material effect on the company s capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
while the company is currently doing remediation at the site of its former newark  new jersey plating facility closed in  the company does not anticipate material expenditures in completing that operation 
no material capital expenditures with respect to the company s bumper plating operations are anticipated during the next months 
although the company believes it is in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations relating to its bumper plating operations  there can be no assurance that the company s current or former operations have not  or will not in the future  violate such laws and regulations or that compliance with such laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
any inadvertent mishandling of hazardous materials or similar incident could result in costly remediation efforts and administrative and legal proceedings  which could materially and adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
in addition  future environmental regulations could add to the overall costs of the company s bumper plating business or otherwise materially and adversely affect these operations 
litigation 
for a description of two matters currently pending against the company  see item legal proceedings below 
volatility of stock price 
the trading price of the company s common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of variations in the company s actual or anticipated operating results  changes in general market conditions and other factors 
in recent years  the stock market generally has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations which often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of a specific company or industry 
there can be no assurance that the market price of the company s common stock will not decline below the current market price 
the results of operations for the fiscal year ended april  were below the expectations of public market analysts and as a result  the price of the company common stock may be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that results in the future may not disappoint and cause a further erosion of the stock price 
item properties the company s principal executive offices are located in pomona  california  on premises owned by the company  which contain approximately  square feet 
the company also leases approximately  square feet of space contiguous to the owned property 
in addition  the company owns facilities used as distribution centers in chicago  illinois  quincy  illinois  bethlehem  pennsylvania  denver  colorado  lincoln  nebraska and palmyra  new jersey  of which two of the facilities also serve as regional hubs and three serve as wheel remanufacturing facilities 
the company has moved its distribution center in new albany  indiana from property owned by the company to leased premises and has put its property up for sale 
the company leases its remaining facilities 
the company s regional hub facilities range from approximately  square feet to  square feet 
its distribution facilities range from approximately  square feet to  square feet 
all of its leased properties are leased for terms expiring on dates ranging from on or about the date hereof to the year  many with options to extend the lease term 
the company believes that no single lease is material to its operations  that its facilities are adequate for the foreseeable future and that alternative sites presently are available at market rates 
of the company s distribution centers  five are leased from parties in which a current officer of the company has an interest 
the company believes that the terms and conditions of these leases are no less favorable to the company than could have been obtained from unaffiliated parties in arm s length transactions at the time of the execution of such leases

the cautionary statements set forth in item above should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements wherever they appear herein 
overview the company is the leading distributor of aftermarket collision parts used in the repair of automobiles and light trucks in north america  with locations throughout the united states and canada 
these product offerings  consisting of more than  stock keeping units  are manufactured by independent manufacturers and are sold primarily to collision repair shops 
approximately of all of the collision repair work is paid for in part through insurance claims 
as a consequence  the company is dependent upon the acceptance of its products in the first instance by insurance companies and then by the collision repair shop performing the repairs 
before  substantially all collision replacements parts were manufactured by original equipment manufacturers oems 
since then  aftermarket parts  which generally sell for between and less than comparable oem parts  have provided a lower cost alternative to insurance companies seeking to contain the escalating cost of collision repairs 
however  aftermarket collision parts still only account for approximately of the collision parts market  which is still dominated by the oems 
because of the company s dependence on the acceptance of its products by insurance companies  its business is vulnerable to actions that impact the insurance industry 
during the past five years  the company s sales and profits have been adversely impacted by class action litigation against insurance companies for specifying aftermarket parts and a concerted effort  generally led by the oems  their dealer network and some collision repair shops  to have legislation passed at the state level restricting or eliminating the use of aftermarket parts in the repair of damaged vehicles 
see cautionary statements above 
other important risks which may impact the company s financial results  include the fact that because the company s business is dependent on a continued source of supply of many automotive body parts which at present are only available from taiwan  it is vulnerable to any disruptions in shipping  increased shipping costs and the relationship of the us dollar to the new taiwan dollar 
challenges currently facing the company include controlling costs  managing its growth and integrating its acquisitions 
escalating costs of audits  sarbanes oxley compliance  health care and commercial insurance  raw materials prices and fuel costs are also challenges for the company at this time 
growth opportunities for the company include expanding its geographical coverage and increasing its penetration of existing markets through acquisitions  as well as greenfield openings  internal growth and expanding into new product markets  such as retail sales through retail parts distributors and offering the company s products on the web 
the company s financial position remains strong  as evidenced by a current ratio current assets to current liabilities of at april   and by the generation of substantial cash flows from operations 
depending upon the size of any acquisitions  the company may be dependent on its bank line of credit to finance them 
general fiscal contained weeks as compared to weeks in fiscal consequently  comparisons of certain results may not be meaningful 
in september  the company voluntarily suspended the sale of aftermarket headlamps for the ford taurus and for the general motors pontiac grand am as a result of independent tests indicating that these headlamps do not fully comply with federal standards 
the company s primary supplier of these headlamps advised the company that it had brought the headlamps into compliance with federal standards  supplying the company with the results of tests by an independent laboratory 
effective in april  the company again began selling the above mentioned headlamps 
as a result of the publication of the initial independent test results  several insurance companies have indicated that they have discontinued specifying all aftermarket lights in vehicle repair 
sales of lighting products during fiscal  constituted approximately of total sales 
while sales to date have not been materially affected by recent suspension actions by certain insurance companies  sales of aftermarket lighting products decreased slightly in the quarter ended april  as compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year 
sales of lighting products increased by approximately from the third to the fourth quarter of the last fiscal year 
prior to september  the company had generally been experiencing double digit growth rates in the sale of lighting products on a year to year comparison 
a continuation of this trend could have an adverse impact on the company s rate of growth 
in january  a taiwanese manufacturer of aftermarket replacement hoods for the hyundai elantra  model years  announced a voluntary recall of hoods sold during the hoods are being recalled because of a possible faulty hood latch 
the manufacturer has agreed to reimburse distributors and body shops for costs incurred in connection with the recall 
the company is assisting the manufacturer in facilitating the recall and has notified its body shop customers who purchased these hoods during the company has not experienced any material losses as a result of its participation in the recall process 
lease accounting charge during fiscal  the company adjusted its accounting for rent under its various operating leases in accordance with the requirements of the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas no 
requires the company to record straight line lease expenses over the term of the lease when a lease contains a fixed rent escalation clause 
the company had been recording the actual rent expense for each year of the lease 
as a result  the company recorded an adjustment of million dollars  substantially all of which was recorded as additional selling and distribution expenses 
of this amount  million related to fiscal years prior to and million related to fiscal critical accounting policies general 
the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  insurance  pensions and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes that the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
bad debt 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company adjusts its allowance monthly based upon a formula relating to the aging of its receivables 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred taxes 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
insurance 
the company s main insurance programs medical  workers compensation and vehicle are designed as large deductible programs 
through these programs  the company self insures losses up to a deductible limit and purchases stop loss insurance to protect against losses that are over the deductible 
the stop loss insurance is purchased on an individual and aggregate basis 
the amount of the deductible has risen significantly in the last two years resulting in a shift of risk from the insurance carrier to the company 
the company estimates its cost for these programs and maintains reserves for incurred  but not reported  losses 
if the company were to experience an increase in claims activity over anticipated amounts  and its reserves are not sufficient  additional reserves may be required  which would have an unanticipated negative impact on future earnings 
acquisitions during fiscal  and  the company completed three  six and three acquisitions  respectively 
all of these acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and the consolidated financial statements include the results of operations for each business for all periods subsequent to the applicable purchase date 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  the company acquired certain assets of lincoln bumper  inc  a distributor of aftermarket collision replacement parts in lincoln  nebraska in june and of royal bumper service  a recycler of plastic bumpers in newberg  oregon at the beginning of fiscal in november  the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of chambers parts distributors  a distributor of aftermarket collision replacement parts with locations in bangor  manchester and portland  maine 
during fiscal  the company acquired certain assets of the following businesses landmark auto parts  a distributor of aftermarket collision replacement parts in newport news  virginia in may  us crash parts  a distributor of aftermarket collision parts in lexington  kentucky in june  kansas bumper mokan  a distributor of aftermarket collision replacement parts in kansas city  lawrence  topeka  manhattan  wichita and liberal  kansas in september  and sam s nu chrome bumper  a distributor of bumpers in new orleans  louisiana in december in addition  the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of two canadian distributors of aftermarket collision replacement parts 
the company acquired multipro in august  with locations in drummondville  montreal  quebec  ottawa and sherbrooke  canada and quinte in january  with locations in trenton  toronto  ottawa and montreal  canada

fiscal year ended april  march  march  in millions automotive body parts bumpers paint and related materials wheels and related products other total sales consists primarily of fenders  hoods  headlight and taillight assemblies  radiators  condensers and grilles 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
this increase was due primarily to increases of million in sales of automotive body parts and million in sales of new and recycled bumpers  which represent increases of approximately and  respectively  compared to fiscal in addition  the company sold million of wheels and related products in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
on a same store sales basis  sales were up approximately for fiscal adjusted to eliminate the effect of the extra week in fiscal  primarily as a result of the fact that insurance companies were continuing to increase the specification of aftermarket parts in the repair of insured vehicles  price increases and increased market share 
gross profit increased to million of net sales in fiscal from million of net sales in fiscal  an increase of 
gross profit percentage was negatively impacted during fiscal by a million write off of obsolete and excess wheel inventory and by a million inventory adjustment booked in the first quarter of fiscal the inventory adjustment was made after the company in june discovered two errors in the software underlying the new management information systems which had resulted in the double counting of certain inventory over the last four quarters  primarily returns of recycled bumpers at certain locations 
the software programs were revised and no further such adjustments have been required 
the company s gross profit margin has fluctuated  and is expected to continue to fluctuate  depending on a number of factors  including changes in product mix  competition and the strength of the united states dollar relative to the taiwanese dollar 
selling and distribution expenses increased to million of net sales in fiscal from million of net sales in fiscal  an increase of 
the increase in these expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of lease expense charges of million to bring the company s rent expense accrual in line with the requirements of sfas no 
which requires that the company record lease expenses on a straight line basis over the term of any lease which includes a fixed rent escalation clause  rather than reflect the actual lease payments 
of that amount  million related to expenses for fiscal years prior to fiscal this revision in the accruing of lease expenses will increase selling and distribution expenses by  in fiscal  based upon existing leases 
selling and distribution expenses were also negatively impacted on a comparative basis as a result of increased fuel costs million  and lease costs relating to a dispute with a landlord and a write off with respect to an abandoned location million 
general and administrative expenses increased to million of net sales in fiscal from million of net sales in fiscal  an increase of 
while these expenses increased as a percentage of net sales in part as a result of the increase in sales  the increase was primarily the result of several other factors 
among these other factors are increased costs of approximately million relating to the retirement of the company s past ceo and the employment of a new ceo who joined the company in june  the cost of the new organizational development group amounting to million and costs in the amount of million relating to the company s compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of while other income increased during fiscal  the increase was offset by a write off of fixed assets no longer in service of million 
as a result of the above factors  the company experienced a decrease in net income in fiscal to million  as compared to net income of million in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
this increase was due primarily to increases of million in sales of automotive body parts  million in sales of new and recycled bumpers and million in sales of paint and related materials  which represent increases of approximately  and  respectively  compared to fiscal in addition  the company sold million of wheels and related products in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
on a same store sales basis  sales were up approximately for the year  primarily as a result of the fact that certain insurance companies were continuing to increase the specification of aftermarket parts in the repair of insured vehicles and price increases 
gross profit increased to million of net sales in fiscal from million of net sales in fiscal  an increase of  primarily as a result of the increase in net sales 
the company s gross profit margin increased  primarily as a result of product mix and pricing 
the company s gross profit margin has fluctuated  and is expected to continue to fluctuate  depending on a number of factors  including changes in product mix  competition and the strength of the united states dollar relative to the taiwanese dollar 
while increasing steel prices have not yet been reflected in increased prices from the company s suppliers  there can be no assurance that such prices will not increase and if so the company may not be able to pass on these increases to its customers 
selling and distribution expenses increased to million of net sales in fiscal from million of net sales in fiscal  an increase of 
these expenses as a percentage of net sales remained constant on a comparative basis notwithstanding increased sales primarily as a result of moving and consolidation expenses at various locations  increased fuel costs and additional employee overtime wages at the location level  in part related to the installation of the new management information system 
general and administrative expenses increased to million of net sales in fiscal from million of net sales in fiscal  an increase of 
these expenses as a percentage of net sales did not change even with the increase in sales 
the increase in dollars is primarily as a result of additional costs from acquisitions  expenses from the management information system implementation relating to training and system depreciation and the payment of an executive search consulting fee 
as a result of the above factors  the company experienced an increase in net income in fiscal to million  as compared to net income of million in fiscal variability of quarterly results and seasonality the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  variations in its sales and profitability from quarter to quarter due  in part  to the timing and integration of acquisitions and the seasonal nature of keystone s business 
the number of collision repairs is directly impacted by the weather 
accordingly  the company s sales generally are highest during the five month period from december to april 
the impact of seasonality has reduced somewhat as keystone has become more geographically diversified 
other factors which influence quarterly variations include the number of business days during the holiday seasons  the timing of the introduction of new products  the level of consumer acceptance of new products  general economic conditions that affect consumer spending  the timing of supplier price changes and the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales and customer delivery requirements 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary use of funds over the past two years has been for acquisitions  the development and implementation of an enterprise wide management information system and the paydown of bank borrowings 
at april   working capital was million compared to million at march  the increase in working capital is primarily the result of cash generated from operations 
the company financed its working capital requirements and the acquisitions completed during fiscal primarily from cash flow from operations 
during the year ended april   the company s cash and cash equivalents increased by  this increase is the result of cash provided by operating activities of million  offset by i cash used in investing activities of million  primarily as a result of cash used to purchase property and equipment primarily related to the implementation of the company s enterprise software package and cash paid for acquisitions and ii cash used in financing activities of million primarily to pay down million outstanding under the bank credit facility  partially offset by million of proceeds from stock option exercises 
the cash provided by operating activities resulted from net income of million increased by million of non cash expenses and partially offset by a million decrease in cash from changes in working capital components 
the working capital component change primarily reflects an increase in inventories and accounts receivable of million and million  respectively  offset by an increase in accounts payable of million 
the most significant non cash expenses were depreciation and amortization of million and a million provision for a write down of inventories and losses on uncollectible accounts receivable of million 
the company has in place a revolving line of credit with a commercial lender that provides for a million secured credit facility which balance is due on july  advances under the revolving line of credit bear interest either at libor plus or at the lender s prime rate 
at april   no amount had been drawn down under the line of credit 
the line of credit is subject to certain restrictive covenants set forth in the loan agreement  which requires that the company maintain certain financial ratios 
the company was not in compliance with all such covenants at april   but had obtained a waiver from its commercial lender prior to the filing of this annual report 
in december  the company caused its commercial lender to renew million of letters of credit and in march issue an additional letter of credit for million to the company s primary insurers to secure the company s deductible reimbursement obligations 
the amount of these letters of credit reduces the funds available under the company s credit facility 
at june   million was available to the company under the line of credit 
the company believes that its existing working capital  anticipated cash flow from operations and funds anticipated to be available under its line of credit will enable it to finance its operations  including concluding possible acquisitions for at least the next months 
however  the company s liquidity expectations are subject to numerous factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
anticipated cash flow from operations are subject to the risks of the business  the most significant of which are discussed under business cautionary statements above 
especially important are the risks discussed under item business cautionary statements litigation impacting aftermarket collision replacement parts and business cautionary statements federal and state action  above 
since the company s product sales are so dependent upon the acceptance of aftermarket parts by insurance companies  adverse judgments or restrictive legislation could reduce sales and negatively impact cash flow from operations 
the availability of funds under the company s line of credit could also be restricted or eliminated in the event that the company does not maintain the financial ratios required under the credit agreement 
these ratios include such items as amount of indebtedness  earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation and amortization  net worth and the current ratio 
in the event that the company s operations do not meet expectations it is possible that needed liquidity will not be available under the credit facility 
contractual obligations the following table quantifies our future contractual obligations as of april  payments due by period total less than one year years years more than years in thousands operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total primarily represents contractual obligations relating to the company s management information systems  including maintenance  software licenses and the outsourcing of its data center operations  and obligations under its primary telecom agreement 
primarily amounts due under the company s defined benefit plan  which is suspended 
inflation the company does not believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation over the past three years have had a significant effect on its net sales or its profitability 
long lived assets goodwill  which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired  amounted to million at april   or approximately of total assets or of consolidated shareholders equity 
goodwill amounted to million at march   or approximately of total assets or of consolidated shareholders equity 
the increase in goodwill from march  was the result of the completion of three acquisitions 
other intangible assets  consisting primarily of covenants not to compete obtained in acquisitions  which have finite lives  will continue to be amortized over the finite life 
as of april   other intangible assets amounted to million 
for the years ended april  and march   amortization of other intangible assets was approximately and million  respectively 
the company reviews the recoverability of its long lived assets as required by sfas no 
and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued a revised statement  share based payment statement r  to address the accounting for stock based employee plans 
the statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using abp and instead requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method of accounting 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of proforma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows in periods after adoption 
statement r  as recently amended  is effective the beginning of the first fiscal year which begins after june  consequently  statement r will not impact the company until the beginning of fiscal in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
subsequently revised in december consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support from other parties 
fin was effective for all variable interest entities for periods ended after december  application for all other types of entities was required in financial statements for periods ended after march  the company reviewed the interpretation and determined that it did not have an impact on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
