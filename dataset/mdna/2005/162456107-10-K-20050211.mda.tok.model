item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
the actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including  but not limited to  those described in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
overview we are a leading marketer and manufacturer of a broad portfolio of branded otc healthcare products  toiletries and dietary supplements including such categories as topical analgesics  medicated skin care products  medicated dandruff shampoos and conditioner  dietary supplements  and other otc and toiletry products 
our portfolio of products includes well recognized brands such as o topical analgesics such as icy hot and aspercreme  o medicated skin care products such as gold bond medicated skin care powder  cream  lotion  first aid  and foot care products  and phisoderm medicated acne treatment products and skin cleansers  o selsun blue medicated dandruff shampoos and conditioner  o dietary supplements including dexatrim  garlique and new phase  and o other otc and toiletry products such as pamprin  a menstrual analgesic  herpecin l  a lip care product  benzodent  a dental analgesic cream  and toiletries such as bullfrog  a line of sunblocks  ultraswim  chlorine removing shampoo  and sun in  a hair lightener 
our products typically target niche markets that are often outside the core product areas of larger companies where we believe we can achieve and sustain significant market penetration through innovation and strong advertising and promotion support 
many of our products are among the us market leaders in their respective categories 
for example  our portfolio of topical analgesic brands and our gold bond medicated body powders have the leading us market share in these categories 
we support our brands through extensive and cost effective advertising and promotion  the expenditures for which represented approximately of our total revenues in fiscal we sell our products nationally through mass merchandiser  drug and food channels principally utilizing our own sales force 
our net income margin net income total revenues was  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
our net income excluding debt extinguishment  impairment and litigation settlement charges margin net income excluding debt extinguishment  impairment and litigation settlement charges total revenues was for fiscal we believe that disclosure of net income excluding debt extinguishment  impairment and litigation settlement charges margin provides investors with useful information regarding our financial performance and allows for easier comparison with net income margin without the effect of the charges in prior periods 
a reconciliation of net income excluding debt extinguishment  impairment and litigation settlement charges to net income for fiscal is presented in the following table for the year ended november  dollars in thousands net income  add loss on early extinguishment of debt  impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets  litigation settlement charges  benefit from income taxes  net income excluding debt extinguishment  impairment and litigation settlement charges  net income excluding debt extinguishment  impairment and litigation settlement charges per common share diluted net income excluding debt extinguishment  impairment and litigation settlement charges margin ebitda  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  is a key non gaap financial measure used by us to measure operating performance but may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
the most directly comparable gaap financial measure is net income 
ebitda and ebitda excluding impairment and litigation settlement charges are used by us to supplement net income as an indicator of operating performance and not as an alternative to measures defined and required by us generally accepted accounting principles 
we consider ebitda an important indicator of our operational strength and performance  including our ability to pay interest  service debt and fund capital expenditures 
ebitda should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for  operating income  net income and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
ebitda is also one measure used in the calculation of certain ratios to determine our compliance with the terms of our revolving credit facility

developments during fiscal in fiscal  we introduced the following product line extensions the icy hot medicated sleeve  dexatrim all in one bar  selsun blue conditioner  pamprin all day  bullfrog superblock spray lotion  phisoderm clear confidence self heating daily scrub and herbal astringent and gold bond therapeutic foot cream 
on february   we issued and sold million of floating rate senior notes due march  the floating rate notes and million of senior subordinated notes due march  the subordinated notes  the proceeds of which were used to purchase all of our outstanding senior subordinated notes and repay the outstanding debt under our prior credit facility 
also  on february   we entered into a new senior secured revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks led by bank of america  na  as agent  that enables us to borrow up to a total of million under the revolving credit facility 
on april   we entered into a class action settlement agreement with representatives of the plaintiffs settlement class  which provided for a national class action settlement of all dexatrim ppa claims  both federal and state 
on november   judge barbara j 
rothstein of the united states district court for the western district of washington entered a final order and judgment certifying the class and granting approval of the dexatrim ppa settlement 
during the first nine months of fiscal  we incurred settlement  legal and administrative costs and expenses associated with the dexatrim litigation totaling million 
prior to the fourth quarter  we were unable to reasonably estimate the amount of liability related to the dexatrim litigation  due to the significant assumptions and uncertainty involved in estimating the value of cases involved 
as a result of the final approval of the dexatrim ppa settlement on november  and the term sheet of settlement reached with interstate on december   as of november  we were able to estimate the probable loss related to the dexatrim litigation 
based on the estimated litigation settlement costs relating to our dexatrim products  we recorded a litigation settlement charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal of which million is included in accrued liabilities in our november  consolidated balance sheet 
we currently do not expect to record any additional charges relative to the settlement of the ppa litigation 
at the end of fiscal  we had completed the transition of selsun s international manufacturing and marketing operations from its prior owner  abbott laboratories abbott  to us in approximately foreign countries  including markets whose combined sales represent approximately of selsun international sales 
abbott will continue to manufacture selsun for us for the european  middle east and certain latin american markets for an additional period ending july and will also serve as our distributor for selsun in certain other foreign countries 
as a result of a decline in sales and reforecasted expected future cash flows in the fourth quarter  we reperformed the impairment test as prescribed by sfas and we determined that a revaluation was required for our dexatrim product line at november  we obtained an independent appraisal to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset related to this product line 
as a result  we incurred an impairment charge of million 
recent developments on december   we also entered into a term sheet of settlement with interstate with regard to interstate s lawsuit to rescind its million of excess coverage for product liability claims relating to dexatrim products containing ppa 
in accordance with the term sheet of settlement  interstate will provide coverage of dexatrim ppa claims that are covered by its policy after million has been paid toward covered claims 
once the million threshold is met  interstate will pay of the next million of claims covered by its policy  of the next million of such claims  and of the last million of such claims 
we are responsible for any claims not covered by the interstate policy either because the alleged injury did not occur before may   or the claim was first made against us after may  in addition  under the term sheet of settlement  we and interstate will dismiss all claims and counterclaims filed against each other  and we will release all claims against interstate relating to the excess coverage product liability insurance 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for income before change in accounting principle and for the periods indicated  certain items from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of total revenues year ended november  total revenues costs and expenses cost of sales advertising and promotion selling  general and administrative impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets litigation settlement total costs and expenses income from operations other income expense interest expense investment and other income expense  net loss on early extinguishment of debt total other income expense income before income taxes and change in accounting principle provision for income taxes income before change in accounting principle critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to use estimates 
several different estimates or methods can be used by management that might yield different results 
the following are the significant estimates used by management in the preparation of the november  consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts as of november   an estimate was made of the collectibility of the outstanding accounts receivable balances 
this estimate requires the utilization of outside credit services  knowledge about the customer and the customer s industry  new developments in the customer s industry and operating results of the customer as well as general economic conditions and historical trends 
when all these facts are compiled  a judgment as to the collectibility of the individual account is made 
many factors can impact this estimate  including those noted in this paragraph 
the adequacy of the estimated allowance may be impacted by the deterioration in the financial condition of a large customer  weakness in the economic environment resulting in a higher level of customer bankruptcy filings or delinquencies and the competitive environment in which the customer operates 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when our products are shipped to our customers 
it is generally our policy across all classes of customers that all sales are final 
as is common in the consumer products industry  customers return products for a variety of reasons including products damaged in transit  discontinuance of a particular size or form of product and shipping errors 
as sales are recorded  we accrue an estimated amount for product returns  as a reduction of these sales  based upon our historical experience and any known specific events that affect the accrual 
we charge the allowance account resulting from this accrual with any authorized deduction from remittance by the customer or product returns upon receipt of the product 
in accordance with industry practice  we allow our customers to return unsold sun care products ie bullfrog and sun in lines of products at the end of the sun care season 
we record the sales at the time the products are shipped and title transfers 
at the time of shipment  we also record a reduction in sales and an allowance on our balance sheet for anticipated returns based upon an estimated return level 
the level of returns may fluctuate from our estimates due to several factors including weather conditions  customer inventory levels and competitive conditions 
each percentage point change in our return rate would impact our net sales by approximately million 
during fiscal  we reduced our estimate of seasonal returns by approximately million  which resulted in an increase to net sales in our consolidated financial statements  as compared to approximately million and million increases in our estimates in fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal and  we also reduced our estimate of non seasonal returns by approximately million and million  respectively  which resulted in an increase to net sales in our consolidated financial statements  as compared to an approximately million increase in our estimate in fiscal we routinely enter into agreements with our customers to participate in promotional programs 
these programs generally take the form of coupons  temporary price reductions  scan downs  display activity and participations in advertising vehicles provided uniquely by the customer 
the ultimate cost of these programs is often variable based on the number of units actually sold 
estimated unit sales of a product under a promotional program are used to estimate the total cost of the program  which is recorded as a reduction of sales 
actual results can differ from the original estimate 
we also consider customer delays in requesting promotional program payments when evaluating the required accrual 
many customers audit programs significantly after the date of performance to determine the actual amount due and make a claim for reimbursement at that time 
as a result  changes in the unit sales trends under promotional programs as well as the timing of payments could result in changes in the accrual 
during fiscal and  we reduced our estimate of promotional accruals by approximately million and million  respectively  which resulted in an increase to net sales or a decrease in advertising and promotion expense in our consolidated financial statements  as compared to an increase in our estimate of approximately million in fiscal income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this approach requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of an asset or liability 
we record income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements based on an estimated annual effective income tax rate 
we revised our annual estimated income tax rate during fiscal to as a result of the implementation of a number of foreign and state tax planning initiatives  which include our determination during the third quarter of fiscal to reinvest indefinitely all undistributed earnings of chattem canada  a wholly owned subsidiary 
undistributed earnings of chattem canada amounted to approximately million during fiscal these earnings are considered to be reinvested indefinitely and  accordingly  no provision for us federal and state income taxes has been provided thereon 
upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise  we would be subject to us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits

fiscal compared to fiscal to facilitate discussion of our operating results for the years ended november  and  we have included the following selected data from our consolidated statements of income for the year ended november  increase decrease amount percentage dollars in thousands domestic net sales    international revenues including royalties   total revenues    cost of sales    advertising and promotion expense    selling  general and administrative expense    impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets   nm litigation settlement charges   nm interest expense    loss on early extinguishment of debt   nm net income    domestic net sales domestic net sales for fiscal increased million or as compared to fiscal for a description of each brand included in the category  see products in item of this form k 
a comparison of domestic net sales for the categories of products included in our portfolio of otc healthcare products is as follows for the year ended november  increase decrease amount percentage dollars in thousands topical analgesics    medicated skin care products    dietary supplements    medicated dandruff shampoos and conditioner    other otc and toiletry products    total    net sales growth in the topical analgesics category was led by a increase in sales of icy hot  which was primarily driven by the continued strength of the icy hot back patch and the newly introduced icy hot medicated sleeve 
net sales growth in this category also resulted from and sales increases in capzasin and aspercreme  respectively 
the overall sales growth in this category was partially offset by a decline in sales of flexall as competition from inside and outside the category increased and media support was curtailed 
net sales growth in the medicated skin care products category resulted from a increase in the gold bond franchise 
gold bond sales growth was attributable to  and increases from the lotion  foot care and cream lines  respectively  and was partially offset by declines in the first aid portion of the business 
the increase in sales from the gold bond lotion line of products was attributable to the successful launch of gold bond ultimate healing skin therapy lotion in the third quarter of fiscal sales growth in the medicated skin care products category was also offset by a decrease in phisoderm sales due to increased competition 
net sales for the dietary supplements category declined primarily due to a decrease in dexatrim diet pill sales 
sales of dexatrim were impacted by the overall decline in the diet pill market resulting in part from negative ephedrine publicity and the impact of low carbohydrate diet products 
the decline in net sales of dexatrim diet pills was partially offset by sales of the dexatrim all in one bar  which was introduced in the first quarter of fiscal the dexatrim all in one bar sales were lower than expected for fiscal  as the category has proved to be more promotional and seasonal than we expected 
domestic net sales of selsun blue medicated dandruff shampoo increased due to an effective advertising campaign and sales of selsun blue conditioner  which was launched in the first quarter of fiscal the increase in net sales for the other otc and toiletry products category was due primarily to sales increases of pamprin and bullfrog 
the increase in sales of pamprin was primarily attributable to the introduction of pamprin all day in the first quarter of fiscal the increase in sales of bullfrog was primarily attributable to expanded distribution and increased sales of pre pack displays 
domestic sales variances were principally the result of changes in unit sales volumes with the exception of pamprin  premsyn pms  phisoderm  flexall  aspercreme  capzasin and sportscreme  for which we implemented a unit sales price increase 
international revenues for fiscal  international revenues increased million or as compared to fiscal due principally to increases in selsun sales in canada  europe and latin america and favorable foreign currency translation

selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or as compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were and of total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
an increase in sales was primarily responsible for the increase in selling expense 
in addition  freight expenses increased due to the increase in fuel costs 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was largely a result of increased incentive compensation and new product development expenses as well as expenses related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets as a result of a decline in sales and reforecasted expected future cash flows in the fourth quarter  we reperformed the impairment test as prescribed by sfas and we determined that a revaluation was required for our dexatrim product line at november  we obtained an independent appraisal to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset related to this product line 
as a result  we incurred an impairment charge of million 
litigation settlement charges litigation settlement charges were million in fiscal this expense was attributable to legal  administrative and estimated settlement costs related to our dexatrim litigation 
interest expense interest expense decreased million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease was largely the result of lower interest rates and a reduction in outstanding debt as a result of our debt refinancing completed during the first quarter of fiscal until our indebtedness is reduced substantially  interest expense will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total revenues 
loss on early extinguishment of debt during fiscal  we retired million principal amount of our senior subordinated notes and the remaining outstanding balance of our million senior secured credit facility  which resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million

sales of icy hot grew principally due to the introduction of the icy hot back patch 
net sales growth in the medicated skin care products category was led by an increase of approximately in the gold bond franchise 
gold bond sales growth was attributable to the successful launch of two new first aid items and the antifungal foot swab in the first quarter and gold bond ultimate healing skin therapy lotion in the third quarter of fiscal in addition  gold bond sales growth came from the lotion and foot care lines 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease of approximately in phisoderm net sales compared to the prior year when the brand was relaunched and the phisoderm clear confidence acne body wash  phisoderm clear confidence acne facial mask and phisoderm clear confidence acne clear swab products were initially shipped to retailers 
net sales for the dietary supplement category declined primarily due to a drop in dexatrim sales from fiscal sales of dexatrim were impacted by the overall decline in the diet pill market driven by negative ephedrine publicity 
the decline in net sales of dexatrim was partially offset by increased sales of garlique and new phase 
the increase in net sales of garlique and new phase was primarily attributable to effective media campaigns and in the case of new phase increased distribution 
domestic net sales of selsun blue medicated dandruff shampoo  which was acquired in march  continued to benefit from a strong advertising campaign and increased retail distribution 
the decrease in net sales of other otc products was due primarily to sales declines of pamprin and premsyn pms  as a result of intense competition 
domestic sales variances were principally the result of changes in unit sales volumes with the exception of new phase  which experienced a unit sales price increase 
international revenues for fiscal  international revenues  including royalties of million from the sales of selsun  increased million or as compared to fiscal our canadian and uk subsidiaries experienced a and sales increase  respectively  primarily as a result of selsun sales 
other international revenues increased almost entirely as a result of the acquisition of selsun blue in the second quarter of fiscal sales variances for international operations were principally the result of changes in unit sales volumes 
cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of total revenues was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal in fiscal  cost of sales increased as a result of higher material costs and manufacturing overhead partially offset by decreased costs resulting from the transition of the north american manufacturing of selsun blue to our facility in chattanooga

until our indebtedness is reduced substantially  interest expense will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total revenues 
investment and other income investment and other income increased million or as compared to fiscal primarily due to a fiscal charge of approximately million related to the write off of equipment offset by a decline in interest income in fiscal the use of cash and cash equivalents to make principal payments on our credit facility and lower interest rates on short term investments contributed to the decrease in interest income 
income before change in accounting principle income before change in accounting principle increased million or as compared to fiscal this increase primarily resulted from lower costs and expenses as a percentage of revenues and increased revenues 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which requires us to perform certain fair value based tests of the carrying value of our indefinite lived intangible assets upon adoption and thereafter at least annually and to discontinue amortization of our indefinite lived intangible assets 
upon adoption of sfas  we obtained independent appraisals to determine the fair value of these assets as of december  and recorded a write down of million  net of income tax benefit of million  as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and discontinued the amortization of our indefinite lived intangible assets 
the write down was primarily related to our sunsource product line  which experienced a decline in sales volume since its initial purchase in  and to a lesser degree our dexatrim product line  which discontinued the marketing of one of its products in november liquidity and capital resources we have historically funded our operations with a combination of internally generated funds and borrowings 
our principal uses of cash are for operating expenses  servicing long term debt  acquisitions  working capital  repurchases of our common stock  payment of income taxes and capital expenditures 
cash of million and million was provided by operations in fiscal and  respectively 
cash flows from operating activities in fiscal were impacted by an increase in the tax benefit realized from stock option exercises as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities offset by an increase in accounts receivable and inventories and a decrease in deferred income taxes 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities related primarily to legal  administrative and settlement costs associated with our dexatrim litigation 
the increase in accounts receivable related primarily to an increase in sales  an increase in international receivables and a decrease in the allowance for returns 
the increase in inventories reflects the building of inventory to support new product launches in the first quarter of fiscal in addition  a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million and an impairment charge of million related to our dexatrim product line were recorded during fiscal investing activities used cash of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in usage of cash was primarily due to reduced spending on capital expenditures  an increase in the cash surrender value of our executive life insurance policies and the change in the funding status of our pension plan from a liability as of november  to an asset as of november  in fiscal  capital expenditures related primarily to equipment and facility modifications to produce selsun blue domestically and construction of our new product development building 
financing activities used cash of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in cash used in financing activities in the current period was attributable to a net repayment of long term debt of million  an increase in debt issuance costs and debt retirement costs of million related to the refinancing transactions  a payment of million for a premium on the interest rate cap agreement and million used to repurchase shares offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million 
as of november   our total debt consisted of our floating rate notes of million and subordinated notes of million 
as of november  and february   we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility with available borrowings up to million 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at libor plus applicable percentages of to or a base rate the higher of the federal funds rate plus or the prime rate plus applicable percentages of to as of november  
the applicable percentages are calculated based on our leverage ratio 
the floating rate notes bear interest at a three month libor plus per year as of november  
on march   we entered into an interest rate cap agreement effective june  with decreasing annual notional principal amounts of million beginning march  and cap rates ranging from to over the life of the agreement 
we paid a million premium to enter into the interest rate cap agreement  which will be amortized over the life of the agreement 
the current portion of the premium on the interest rate cap agreement of million is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets  and the long term portion of million is included in other noncurrent assets 
the amortized value of the premium on the interest rate cap was compared to its fair value as of november   and a charge of million  net of tax  was recorded to other comprehensive income 
the interest rate cap agreement terminates on march  in january  our board of directors increased the total authorization to repurchase our common stock under our stock buyback program to million 
during fiscal  we repurchased  shares for million 
the remaining availability under the board authorization was million as of november  in january  the board of directors increased the total authorization to repurchase our common stock under the buyback program to million 
we are limited in our ability to repurchase shares due to restrictions under the terms of our revolving credit facility and the indentures pursuant to which the floating rate notes and subordinated notes were issued 
we believe that cash provided by operating activities  our cash and cash equivalents balance and funds available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures  debt service and working capital requirements for the foreseeable future as our business is currently conducted 
it is likely that any acquisitions we make in the future will require us to obtain additional financing 
contractual obligations the following data summarizes our contractual obligations as of november  we had no commercial obligations as of november  payments due by contractual obligations total within year years years after years dollars in thousands long term debt   operating leases  purchase commitments   total     purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
foreign operations historically  our primary foreign operations have been conducted through our canadian and united kingdom uk subsidiaries 
as of november   our european business is conducted through chattem global consumer products limited  a wholly owned subsidiary located in limerick  ireland 
the functional currencies of these subsidiaries are canadian dollars  british pounds and euros  respectively 
fluctuations in exchange rates can impact operating results  including total revenues and expenses  when translations of the subsidiary financial statements are made in accordance with sfas no 
 foreign currency translation 
for fiscal and  these subsidiaries accounted for and of total revenues  respectively  and and of total assets  respectively 
it has not been our practice to hedge our assets and liabilities in canada  the uk and ireland or our intercompany transactions due to the inherent risks associated with foreign currency hedging transactions and the timing of payments between us and our foreign subsidiaries 
following our acquisition of selsun blue  which is sold in approximately foreign countries  our international business operations have expanded significantly  which will increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
during fiscal  a portion of these foreign sales was reflected as royalties  which have been paid to us in us dollars 
in addition  abbott has continued to supply a portion of our international product where appropriate and bill us in us dollars 
beginning april   we were billed in local currencies 
historically  gains or losses from foreign currency transactions have not had a material impact on our operating results 
gains of million for each year ended november  and  respectively  resulted from foreign currency transactions and are included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income
