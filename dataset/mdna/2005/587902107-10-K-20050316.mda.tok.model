overview the company and its subsidiaries underwrite property and casualty insurance in new jersey and pennsylvania 
our consolidated operating insurance company subsidiaries are mercer insurance company  a pennsylvania property and casualty stock insurance company offering insurance coverages to businesses and individuals in new jersey and pennsylvania  mercer insurance company of new jersey  inc  a new jersey property and casualty stock insurance corporation offering insurance coverages to businesses and individuals located in new jersey  and franklin insurance company  a property and casualty stock insurance company offering private passenger automobile and homeowners insurances to individuals located in pennsylvania 
we manage our business and report our operating results in three operating segments commercial lines insurance  personal lines insurance and the investment function 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
however  we do not allocate assets to segments  and assets are reviewed in the aggregate for decision making purposes 
our commercial lines insurance business consists primarily of multi peril and general liability and related coverages 
our personal lines insurance business consists primarily of homeowners and private passenger automobile insurance coverages 
we market both the commercial and personal insurance lines through independent agents 
our income is principally derived from insurance premiums received from insureds in the commercial lines businesses insured and personal lines individuals insured segments  less the costs of underwriting the insurance policies  the costs of settling and paying claims reported on the policies  and from investment income reduced by investment expenses  and from gains or losses on holdings in our investment portfolio 
variability in our income is caused by a variety of circumstances  some within the control of our companies 
table of contents and some not within their control 
premium volume is affected by  among other things  the availability of quality  properly priced underwriting risks being produced by our agents  the ability to retain on renewal existing good performing accounts  competition from other insurance companies  regulatory rate approvals  our reputation  and other limitations created by the marketplace or regulators 
our underwriting costs are affected by  among other things  the amount of commission and profit sharing we pay our agents to produce the underwriting risks we receive premiums for  the cost of issuing insurance policies and maintaining our customer and agent relationships  marketing costs  taxes we pay to the states we operate in on the amount of premium we collect  and other assessments and charges imposed on our companies by the regulators in the states in which we do business 
our claim and claim settlement costs are affected by  among other things  the quality of our underwriting accounts  severe weather in our operating region  the nature of the claim  the regulatory and legal environment in our territories  inflation in underlying medical and property repair costs  and the availability and cost of reinsurance 
our investment income and realized gains and losses are determined by  among other things  market forces  the rates of interest and dividends paid on our portfolio holdings  the credit or investment quality of the issuer and the success of its underlying business  the market perception of the company invested in  and other factors such as ratings by rating agencies and analysts 
critical accounting policies general we are required to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an on going basis based on historical developments  market conditions  industry trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that actual results will conform to our estimates and assumptions  and that reported results of operation will not be materially adversely affected by the need to make accounting adjustments to reflect changes in these estimates and assumptions from time to time 
we believe the following policies are the most sensitive to estimates and judgments 
liabilities for loss and loss adjustment expenses the liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses represents estimates of the ultimate unpaid cost of all losses incurred  including losses for claims that have not yet been reported to our insurance companies 
the amount of loss reserves for reported claims is based primarily upon a case by case evaluation of the type of risk involved  knowledge of the circumstances surrounding each claim and the insurance policy provisions relating to the type of loss 
the amounts of loss reserves for unreported claims and loss adjustment expenses are determined using historical information by line of insurance as adjusted to current conditions 
inflation is ordinarily implicitly provided for in the reserving function through analysis of costs  trends and reviews of historical reserving results over multiple years 
reserves are closely monitored and are recomputed periodically using the most recent information on reported claims and a variety of statistical techniques 
specifically  on a quarterly basis  we review  by line of business  existing reserves  new claims  changes to existing case reserves  and paid losses with respect to the current and prior accident years 
we use historical paid and incurred losses and accident year data to derive expected ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense ratios by line of business 
we then apply these expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratios to in force business to derive a reserve level for each line of business 
this amount  together with reserves required by new reported claims and changes to existing case reserves  is compared to existing reserves to establish the adjustment to reserves that is required 
in connection with the determination of the reserves  we also consider other specific factors such as recent weather related losses  trends in historical paid losses  and legal and judicial trends with respect to theories of liability 
because of the nature of our business  which generally provides coverage for short term risks  loss development is comparatively rapid and historical paid losses  adjusted for known variables  have been a reliable predictive measure of future losses 

table of contents nevertheless  reserves are estimates because there are uncertainties inherent in the determination of ultimate losses 
court decisions  regulatory changes and economic conditions can affect the ultimate cost of claims that occurred in the past as well as create uncertainties regarding future loss cost trends 
accordingly  the ultimate liability for unpaid losses and loss settlement expenses will likely differ from the amount recorded at december  changes in estimates or differences between estimates and amounts ultimately paid are reflected in current operations 
loss reserving techniques and assumptions have been consistently applied during the periods presented 
the table below summarizes the effect on net loss reserves and surplus in the event of reasonably likely changes in the variables considered in establishing loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
the range of reasonably likely changes was established based on a review of changes in accident year development by line of business and applied to loss reserves as a whole 
the selected range of changes does not indicate what could be the potential best or worst case or likely scenarios adjusted loss adjusted loss and and loss change in loss loss adjustment percentage adjustment percentage and loss reserves net of change in reserves net of change in adjustment reinsurance as of equity as of reinsurance as of equity as of reserves net of december  december  december  december  reinsurance dollars in thousands base   net of tax the property and casualty industry has incurred substantial aggregate losses from claims related to asbestos related illnesses  environmental remediation  product and construction defect liability  mold  and other uncertain or environmental exposures 
we have not experienced significant losses from these types of claims 
in the discussions that follow  we use the term loss development  which refers to the calendar year income statement impact of changes in the provision for loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred in prior accident years 

table of contents the table below summarizes loss and loss adjustment reserves by major line of business december  dollars in thousands commercial lines commercial multi peril other liability workers compensation commercial automobile fire  allied  inland marine personal lines homeowners personal automobile fire  allied  inland marine other liability workers compensation total investments unrealized investment gains or losses on investments carried at fair value  net of applicable income taxes  are reflected directly in stockholders equity as a component of comprehensive income and  accordingly  have no effect on net income 
a decline in fair value of an investment below its cost that is deemed other than temporary is charged to earnings as a realized loss 
we monitor our investment portfolio and review investments that have experienced a decline in fair value below cost to evaluate whether the decline is other than temporary 
these evaluations involve judgment and consider the magnitude and reasons for a decline and the prospects for the fair value to recover in the near term 
in the years ended december   and  we recorded a pre tax charge to earnings of   and  respectively 
these charges are primarily with respect to equity securities that we determined were other than temporarily impaired 
adverse investment market conditions  poor operating performance  or other adversity encountered by companies whose stock or fixed maturity securities we own could result in impairment charges in the future 
the company s policy on impairment of value of investments is as follows if a security has a market value below cost it is considered impaired 
for any such security a review of the financial condition and prospects of the company will be performed by the investment committee to determine if the decline in market value is other than temporary 
if it is determined that the decline in market value is other than temporary  the carrying value of the security will be written down to realizable value and the amount of the write down accounted for as a realized loss 
realizable value is defined for this purpose as the market price of the security 
write down to a value other than the market price requires objective evidence in support of that value 
in evaluating the potential impairment of fixed income securities  the investment committee will evaluate relevant factors  including but not limited to the following the issuer s current financial condition and ability to make future scheduled principal and interest payments  relevant rating history  analysis and guidance provided by rating agencies and analysts  the degree to which an issuer is current or in arrears in making principal and interest payments  and changes in price relative to the market 
in evaluating the potential impairment of equity securities  the investment committee will evaluate certain factors  including but not limited to the following the relationship of market price per share versus 
table of contents carrying value per share at the date of acquisition and the date of evaluation  the price to earnings ratio at the date of acquisition and the date of evaluation  any rating agency announcements  the issuer s financial condition and near term prospects  including any specific events that may influence the issuer s operations  the independent auditor s report on the issuer s financial statements  and any buy sell hold recommendations or price projections by outside investment advisors 
we have one significant non traded equity security  a non voting common stock in excess reinsurance company  which is carried at million 
excess reinsurance company paid a special dividend in to the group in the amount of  its fair value is estimated at the statutory book value as reported to the national association of insurance commissioners naic 
other non traded securities  which are not material in the aggregate  are carried at cost 
policy acquisition costs we defer policy acquisition costs  such as commissions  premium taxes and certain other underwriting expenses that vary with and are directly related to the production of business 
these costs are amortized over the effective period of the related insurance policies 
the method followed in computing deferred policy acquisition costs limits the amount of deferred costs to their estimated realizable value  which gives effect to the premium to be earned  related investment income  loss and loss adjustment expenses  and certain other costs expected to be incurred as the premium is earned 
future changes in estimates  the most significant of which is expected loss and loss adjustment expenses  may require acceleration of the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
reinsurance amounts recoverable from property and casualty reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liability associated with the reinsured policy 
amounts paid for reinsurance contracts are expensed over the contract period during which insured events are covered by the reinsurance contracts 
ceded unearned premiums and reinsurance balances recoverable on paid and unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses are reported separately as assets  instead of being netted with the appropriate liabilities  because reinsurance does not relieve us of our legal liability to our policyholders 
reinsurance balances recoverable are subject to credit risk associated with the particular reinsurer 
additionally  the same uncertainties associated with estimating unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses affect the estimates for the ceded portion of these liabilities 
we continually monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes arise from the recognition of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the enactment date 
results of operations our results of operations are influenced by factors affecting the property and casualty insurance industry in general 
the operating results of the united states property and casualty insurance industry are subject to significant variations due to competition  weather  catastrophic events  regulation  general economic conditions  judicial trends  fluctuations in interest rates and other changes in the investment environment 

table of contents revenue and income by segment is as follows for the years ended december   and december  in thousands revenues net premiums earned commercial lines personal lines total net premiums earned net investment income realized investment gains losses other total revenues income before income taxes underwriting income loss commercial lines personal lines total underwriting income loss net investment income realized investment gains losses other income before income taxes and minority interest in income of subsidiary our growth in premiums and underwriting results have been  and continue to be  influenced by market conditions 
pricing in the property and casualty insurance industry historically has been cyclical 
during a soft market cycle  price competition is prevalent and makes it difficult to write and retain properly priced personal and commercial lines business 
our policy is to maintain our disciplined underwriting and pricing standards during soft markets  even at the expense of premium growth 
after a sustained soft market cycle  the insurance industry entered into a hard market cycle in approximately early  which continued into beginning in  the industry has seen increasing competition and a softening of rates in many markets  many of which we compete in  and particularly in property exposures 
if market rates continue to soften  it may have a negative impact on our ability to grow  and on our underwriting margins 
the cyclicality of the market  and its potential impact on our results  is difficult to predict with any significant reliability 
on june   we acquired the controlling interest  when taken into account with other considerations of the outstanding shares of common stock of franklin holding and thereafter consolidated the financial condition and results of operations of franklin holding with mercer insurance company 
for the period between june  and december   we allocated a portion of franklin holding s net income to the minority interest in franklin holding 
this resulted in allocations of income to minority interest of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the minority interest in franklin holding was acquired by the company immediately after the conversion  through an exchange of shares in which the owners of the minority interest received  shares of the company in exchange for all minority shares in franklin holding 
since franklin holding company  inc became wholly owned within the group in december   no further income will be allocated to the minority interest for it 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  the components of income for and  and the change and percentage change from year to year  are shown in the charts below

a strong performance in our commercial lines underwriting results  coupled with a modest improvement in our personal lines underwriting results  resulted in a return to underwriting profitability in from  with an overall underwriting profit of  as compared to an underwriting loss of million in our gaap combined ratio improved to in from  and our statutory combined ratio improved in to from 
our net investment income increased to million  primarily as a result of the increased investment portfolio resulting from the receipt of million in conversion proceeds on december  realized investment gains  primarily from the sale of equity securities in both and  added to the company s income as the equities portfolio value continued to grow in our other income  primarily service charges recorded on insurance premiums paid over the term of the policy instead of when the policy is issued  declined modestly in in there was no minority interest in the income of our subsidiary  as there was in  because all of the minority interest was acquired immediately after the conversion in the acquisition of the remaining of franklin holding company 
also impacting the company s income in was the cost of being a public company  which adversely impacted both net income and the gaap underwriting expense ratio  and  to a lesser extent  the statutory underwriting expense ratio 
net loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred increased in overall by only  or  to million  reflecting lower claims frequency in over  despite growth in exposures in as our net premium earned grew by 
the lower loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in resulted from more normal weather patterns than were experienced in our operating territory in  which included hail  
table of contents tornados  and windstorms  all of which resulted in a higher than usual frequency of claims throughout most of loss development of prior year net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves was a favorable million in and was generally attributable to accident years and for commercial multi peril  commercial auto and other liability 
loss reserves for these and all other lines of business have been established based on company trends and our consideration of industry trends  and recent settlement of reported cases has been favorable 
this favorable development is a reflection of the disciplined underwriting employed by the company in its risk selection process

this increase was due primarily to a million increase in net premiums earned in  and an increase in net investment income of million 
direct premiums written increased to million in  reflecting the return of the market to a more competitive pricing posture and the company s reluctance to take on underwriting risks which are priced inappropriately

in addition  the company received a special dividend of  in on its investment in excess reinsurance company  compared to no dividend in effective january   the company engaged a new management firm for its fixed income securities portfolio 
one of its assignments was to invest the proceeds of the conversion  which  given a difficult interest rate environment and fixed income securities market  was not largely completed until the second quarter of consequently  a significant portion of the conversion proceeds earned a cash equivalent yield during 
table of contents this period 
in addition  investment expenses increased in by approximately  for the cost of such management  compared to the prior commission based fixed income securities management which existed while the company was a mutual insurance company prior to the conversion 
in implementing the investment policy guidelines and directions of the investment committee of the board of directors  the fixed income securities managers have changed the composition of the fixed income securities portfolio to be more heavily weighted in tax exempt securities  industrial and miscellaneous fixed income securities  and mortgage backed securities  and less heavily weighted towards u 
s government and government agencies fixed income securities 
the portfolio remains invested in investment grade fixed income securities  with  as of december   an average rating of aaa  an average duration of years excluding mortgage backed securities  and average tax equivalent yield of

these reduced costs will be offset by some higher staffing costs  but we also should be positioned to expand premium volume in the near term without material incremental expense because of increased processing capacity

in addition  there was considerably more snow during the first quarter of compared to the same period in these conditions lead to losses from frozen pipes  structural collapses  more frequent automobile losses and slip and fall accidents 
we also had unusual weather events in the second and third quarters  including hail  tornados  and windstorms  all of which resulted in a higher than usual frequency of claims

in addition  we originally had expected a development of losses that was more in line with the industry  but this has not occurred 
these factors have resulted in the favorable development indicated and are a reflection of the disciplined underwriting employed by the company 
favorable development was also present in other lines of business and resulted from the normal claims review process  and not from changes in key assumptions or reserving philosophy 
underwriting expenses increased by million  or  to million for  from this increase was principally attributable to an increase in expenses due to higher amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs resulting from higher premium volume  and the charge of  pre tax associated with the allocation of shares to employee participants by the esop for we are currently in the process of converting our information system 
when completed  we expect some costs to moderate as conversion costs and costs associated with operating dual systems end 
these reduced costs will be offset by some higher 
table of contents staffing costs  but we also should be positioned to expand premium volume without material incremental expense because of increased processing capacity 
we also expect underwriting expenses to moderate in future periods because we intend to significantly reduce the amount of business written in mercer insurance company  the new jersey business of which became subject to new jersey s retaliatory premium tax when it redomesticated to pennsylvania in we plan to do this by renewing  to the extent possible  mercer insurance company premium volume in mercer insurance company of new jersey  inc  our new jersey domestic insurer that is not subject to this retaliatory tax 
we had not previously renewed policies in our new jersey subsidiary because only policyholders of mercer insurance company  domiciled in pennsylvania  had subscription and voting rights 
therefore  renewing policies in the new jersey subsidiary before completion of the conversion would have denied subscription rights to mercer insurance company s policyholders and disenfranchised them 
the cost of the additional premium tax was  for and  for federal income tax expense was  for  an effective rate of  compared to  an effective rate of  in the decrease in the effective tax rate in is attributable to tax exempt investment income being a larger percentage of net income than in the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources our insurance companies generate sufficient funds from their operations and maintain a high degree of liquidity in their investment portfolios 
the primary source of funds to meet the demands of claim settlements and operating expenses are premium collections  investment earnings and maturing investments 
mercer insurance company in completed an expansion of its facilities in pennington  new jersey  at a cost of million 
these improvements are fully paid for and will not require any further use of operating cash flow 
we are also in the process of building an information system platform that will allow our producers to conduct their business through the internet or through the method they have historically used 
as of december   we have spent million on the development of this platform  which includes license fees for software used in the platform 
it is anticipated to be completed in mid  at an additional cost of million 
mercer insurance company possesses sufficient resources for these future expenditures without incurring any debt 
our insurance companies maintain investment and reinsurance programs that are intended to provide sufficient funds to meet their obligations without forced sales of investments 
they maintain a portion of their investment portfolio in relatively short term and highly liquid assets to ensure the availability of funds 
the principal source of liquidity for mercer insurance group will continue to be the net proceeds it retained from the conversion stock offering  and dividend payments when allowed by regulators and other fees received from mercer insurance company 
for a period of three years after the conversion  mercer insurance company may not declare or pay any dividend to mercer insurance group without the approval of the pennsylvania insurance department 
after this three year period  mercer insurance company will be restricted by the insurance laws of pennsylvania as to the amount of dividends or other distributions it may pay to its holding company 
under pennsylvania law  there is a maximum amount that may be paid by mercer insurance company during any twelve month period after notice to  but without prior approval of  the pennsylvania insurance department 
this limit is the greater of of mercer insurance company s statutory surplus as reported on its most recent annual statement filed with the pennsylvania insurance department  or the net income of mercer insurance company for the period covered by such annual statement 
if the dividend restrictions imposed on mercer insurance company related to the conversion were not in effect  then as of december   the amounts available for payment of dividends from mercer insurance company in  without the prior approval of the pennsylvania insurance department would have been approximately million 
prior to its payment of any dividends  mercer insurance company of new jersey  inc is required to provide notice of the intended dividends to the new jersey department of banking and insurance 
new jersey 
table of contents law sets the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid  which amount cannot exceed the greater of of mercer insurance company of new jersey  inc s statutory surplus as reported on the most recent annual statement filed with new jersey  or the net income  not including realized capital gains  for the period covered by the annual statement 
the new jersey department has the power to limit or prohibit dividend payments if certain conditions exist 
these restrictions or any subsequently imposed restrictions may affect our future liquidity 
as of december   the amount available for payment of dividends by mercer insurance company of new jersey  inc to mercer insurance company in without the prior approval of new jersey department of banking and insurance is approximately million 
as a pennsylvania domiciled insurance company  dividends payable by franklin insurance company are subject to the same formula limitation described above for mercer insurance company 
as of december   the amount available for payment of dividends from franklin insurance company in  without the prior approval of the pennsylvania insurance department  is approximately million 
total assets increased  or million to million  at december  from december  increased premium volume drove increases in premium receivables of million  or  and deferred policy acquisition costs of  or 
reinsurance receivables decreased million  or  due to higher retentions under the company s reinsurance agreements 
investments increased million  or  to million  and cash balances increased  or 
other assets decreased million  or  to million  principally due to a federal income tax refund received in total liabilities increased  or million  in  to million 
increased premium volume is primarily responsible for the increase in unearned premium reserves of million  or 
loss and loss expense reserves decreased million  or  as a result of the payment of a large number of case reserves related to claims accrued but unpaid at the end of  and which related to the unusually high claims frequency experienced by the company in late total stockholders equity increased by million  or  due principally to earnings  offset in part by purchases of treasury stock in the amount of million 
unrealized gains on the investment portfolio increased  after tax  due principally to growth in the value of the company s equities portfolio 
in connection with the conversion  the esop was established  and purchased  shares from the company in return for a note bearing interest at on the principal amount of  mercer insurance company will make annual contributions to the esop sufficient to repay that loan to the company 
it is anticipated that the loan will be repaid in equal annual installments  and that  in proportion to annual principal and interest payments  approximately of the original esop shares will be allocated annually to employee participants of the esop 
an expense charge will be booked ratably during each year for the shares committed to be allocated to participants that year  determined with reference to the fair market value of the company s stock at the time the commitment to allocate the shares is accrued and recognized 
the issuance of the shares to the esop was fully recognized in the additional paid in capital account at conversion  with a contra account entitled unearned esop shares established in the stockholders equity section of the balance sheet for the unallocated shares at an amount equal to their original per share purchase price 
mercer insurance group adopted a stock based incentive plan at its annual meeting of shareholders 
pursuant to that plan  mercer insurance group may issue a total of  shares  equal to of the shares of common stock that were issued in the conversion 
of this amount  an amount equal to of the shares of common stock issued in the conversion  or  shares  may be used to make restricted stock awards under the stock based incentive plan 
the number of shares available for issuance under the plan will increase automatically each year by of the number of shares outstanding at the end of the preceding year 
the company may purchase shares of its common stock in the open market and contribute those shares to the stock based incentive plan for use in making restricted stock awards under that plan 
the fair market value of any common stock used for restricted stock awards will initially represent unearned compensation 
as mercer insurance group accrues compensation expense to reflect the vesting of such shares  unearned compensation will be reduced accordingly 
this compensation expense will be deductible for federal income tax purposes upon vesting 
as described in the following paragraph  the company undertook to repurchase shares as a partial offset to the stock incentive plan issuances 
during  the company made grants of  shares 
table of contents of restricted stock  grants of  incentive stock options  and grants of  non qualified stock options 
on june   the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of its common stock  to be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions as  in management s sole opinion  market conditions warranted 
the repurchased shares are to be held as treasury shares available for issuance in connection with mercer insurance group s stock incentive plan 
as of september    shares had been repurchased under this authorization for a total consideration of million  or per share 
on october   the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional  shares of its common stock  under the same terms and conditions 
as of march   all  shares authorized under the second authorization have been purchased  including  shares purchased in for million 
the total cost of repurchases under this authorization was million  or per share 
in the aggregate   shares have been purchased under both authorizations  for a total cost of million  or per share  a price accretive to the company s book value 
the purchases were funded with available cash or short term investments maintained in the holding company 
impact of inflation inflation increases consumers needs for property and casualty insurance coverage 
inflation also increases claims incurred by property and casualty insurers as property repairs  replacements and medical expenses increase 
these cost increases reduce profit margins to the extent that rate increases are not implemented on an adequate and timely basis 
we establish property and casualty insurance premiums levels before the amount of losses and loss expenses  or the extent to which inflation may affect these expenses  are known 
therefore  our insurance companies attempt to anticipate the potential impact of inflation when establishing rates 
because inflation has remained relatively low in recent years  financial results have not been significantly affected by inflation 
inflation also often results in increases in the general level of interest rates  and  consequently  generally results in increased levels of investment income derived from our investments portfolio

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we have exposure to three principal types of market risk through our investment activities interest rate risk  credit risk and equity risk 
our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates 
we have not entered  and do not plan to enter  into any derivative financial instruments for hedging  trading or speculative purposes 

table of contents interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates 
our exposure to interest rate changes primarily results from our significant holdings of fixed rate investments 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these securities 
as of december   the average maturity of our fixed income investment portfolio excluding mortgage backed securities was years 
our fixed maturity investments include us government bonds  securities issued by government agencies  obligations of state and local governments and governmental authorities  corporate bonds and mortgage backed securities  most of which are exposed to changes in prevailing interest rates 
we carry these investments as available for sale 
this allows us to manage our exposure to risks associated with interest rate fluctuations through active review of our investment portfolio by our management and board of directors and consultation with our financial advisor 
fluctuations in near term interest rates could have an impact on the results of operations and cash flows 
certain of these fixed income securities have call features 
in a declining interest rate environment  these securities may be called by their issuer and replaced with securities bearing lower interest rates 
in a rising interest rate environment  we may sell these securities rather than holding to maturity and receive less than we paid for them 
as a general matter  we do not attempt to match the durations of our assets with the durations of our liabilities 
our goal is to maximize the total return on all of our investments 
an important strategy that we employ to achieve this goal is to try to hold enough in cash and short term investments in order to avoid liquidating longer term investments to pay claims 
the table below shows the interest rate sensitivity of our fixed income financial instruments measured in terms of market value which is equal to the carrying value for all our securities 
as of december  market value basis no rate basis point change change point change in thousands bonds and preferred stocks cash and cash equivalents total credit risk the quality of our interest bearing investments is generally good 
of our fixed maturity securities are rated investment grade 
equity risk equity price risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in equity prices 
our exposure to changes in equity prices primarily results from our holdings of common stocks  mutual funds and other equities 
our portfolio of equity securities is carried on the balance sheet at fair value 
therefore  an adverse change in market prices of these securities would result in losses 
portfolio characteristics are analyzed regularly and market risk is actively managed through a variety of techniques 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  when an equity security becomes other than temporarily impaired  we record this impairment as a charge against earnings 
for the year ended december   we recorded pre tax charges of  for an individual equity security that we concluded was other than temporarily impaired  and sold in early company and industry concentrations are monitored by the board of directors 
at december   mercer insurance company s equity portfolio made up of the company s total investment portfolio  and was relatively concentrated in terms of the number of issuers and industries 
at december   mercer insurance company s top ten equity holdings represented million or of the equity portfolio 

table of contents investments in the financial sector represented while investments in pharmaceutical companies  conglomerates and information technology companies represented  and  respectively  of the equity portfolio at december  such concentration can lead to higher levels of short term price volatility 
due to our long term investment focus  we are not as concerned with short term volatility as long as our insurance subsidiaries ability to write business is not impaired
