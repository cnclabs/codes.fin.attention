overview netscout systems  inc designs  develops  manufactures  markets  sells and supports a family of integrated products that enable performance and optimization of complex  high speed networks  including the ability to efficiently deliver critical business applications and content to end users 
we manufacture and market these products in an integrated hardware and software solution that has been used by enterprises  governmental agencies and service providers worldwide 
we manage our business as a single operating segment and substantially all of our identifiable assets are located in the united states of america 
netscout was incorporated in as a consulting services company 
in  we began to develop  manufacture and market our first infrastructure performance management products 
our operations have been financed principally through cash provided by operations 
our operating results are influenced by a number of factors  including the mix of products and services sold and license and royalties received  pricing  costs of materials used in our products and the expansion of our operations during the fiscal year 
factors that affect our ability to maximize our operating results include our ability to introduce and enhance existing products  the marketplace acceptance of those new or enhanced products  continued expansion into international markets  and current economic conditions 
in the fiscal year ended march   we achieved year over year growth in revenue of 
while much of this success is attributable to the continued momentum and traction of our cdm strategy  we also saw the highest rate of new product introduction in our history 
during the fiscal year ended march  we announced the plan to acquire quantiva  which will improve our leading marketing position by using real time performance metrics that establish statistically expected behavior values using advanced modeling and analytics and will accelerate our strategic direction towards automated performance management  an automated system for identifying and diagnosing performance anomalies before they affect end users 
this acquisition was consummated in april in fiscal year we plan to continue to strengthen our channel relationships  
table of contents launch new marketing programs to grow our market share and continue our revenue growth 
we expect revenue to increase sequentially from the fourth quarter of fiscal year to the first quarter of fiscal year in addition  we expect our first quarter of fiscal year to have higher operating expenses due in part to additional costs related to the quantiva acquisition  as well as  increased marketing tradeshows and seminar activity 
in fiscal year  our total revenue increased million to million compared to million in fiscal year our cost of revenue  increased by million to million compared to million in fiscal year  which resulted in our gross profit increasing to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year our gross margin is primarily impacted by volume and further by the mix of product  service  and license and royalty revenue 
we realize significantly higher gross margins on license and royalty revenue relative to product and service revenue and higher gross margins on service revenue relative to product revenue 
our operating expenses  which include research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses  as well as amortization of other intangible assets increased by million in fiscal year to million compared to million in fiscal year primary contributors to this increase in overall expenses were a million increase in personnel costs due to increased headcount  employee compensation  as well as  non sales incentive compensation  a million increase in commissions which was mainly due to increased revenue attainment and higher attainment of incentive programs  the capitalization of software development costs of million in fiscal year  which did not recur in fiscal year  as well as  a  increase in professional services  mainly due to efforts associated with compliance with sarbanes oxley 
net income for fiscal year increased by million to million compared to a net loss of  for fiscal year this increase is primarily due to the increase in gross profit of million that resulted from higher revenue attainment  partially offset by the increase in operating expenses of million  and an increase in income tax expense of million due to income tax expense associated with an increase in pre tax income  offset by the resolution of a federal income tax audit in fiscal year which resulted in a net income tax benefit of  critical accounting policies netscout considers accounting policies related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of inventories  valuation of goodwill  capitalization of software development costs and internal use software and income taxes to be critical in fully understanding and evaluating our financial results 
revenue recognition product revenue consists of sales of our hardware products and licensing of our software products 
product revenue is recognized upon shipment  provided that evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
service revenue consists primarily of fees from customer support agreements  consulting and training 
we generally provide three months of software support and months of hardware support as part of product sales 
revenue from software support is deferred and recognized ratably over the three month support period 
revenue from hardware support is deferred and recognized ratably over the month support period 
in addition  customers can elect to purchase extended support agreements  typically for month periods 
revenue from these agreements is deferred and recognized ratably over the support period 
revenue from consulting and training is recognized as the work is performed 
license and royalty revenue consists primarily of royalties under license agreements by original equipment manufacturers who incorporate components of our data collection technology into their own products or who reproduce and sell our software products 
license revenue is recognized when delivery of the original equipment 
table of contents manufacturer s product has occurred and when we become contractually entitled to receive license fees  provided that such fees are fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
royalty revenue is recognized based upon reported product shipments by the license holder 
multi element arrangements are customer purchases of a combination of netscout product and service offerings which may be delivered at various points in time 
for multi element arrangements  each item of the purchase is analyzed and a portion of the total purchase price is allocated to the undelivered items  primarily support agreements and training  using vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of that undelivered item 
under the residual method  the remaining portion of the purchase price is allocated to the delivered items  generally hardware products and licensed software products  regardless of any separate prices stated within the contract for each item 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered items is based on the price customers pay when the item is sold separately 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable is reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts 
our standard payment terms are net days 
we monitor all payments from our customers and assess any collection issues as they arise 
we believe our credit policies are prudent and reflect normal industry terms and business risk 
at march   no one customer accounted for of our accounts receivable balance 
at march   one customer accounted for approximately of our accounts receivable balance 
historically  we have not experienced any significant non performance by our customers nor do we anticipate non performance by our customers in the future and  accordingly  typically we do not require collateral from our customers 
on rare occasions we will require select international customers to provide a letter of credit 
we perform credit checks on all potential new customers prior to acceptance of an order 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for possible losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make their required payments and any losses are recorded as general and administrative expenses 
as of march  and our allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  respectively 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon our judgments and estimates of the uncollectability of specific accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and customer concentrations 
significant judgments and estimates are made when establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if these accounting judgments and estimates prove to be materially inaccurate  our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
valuation of inventories inventories are stated at the lower of actual cost or their net realizable value 
cost is determined by using the first in  first out fifo method 
inventories consist primarily of raw materials and finished goods 
inventory carrying values are reduced to our estimate of net realizable value through a reserve for obsolete and excess inventory 
as of march  and our reserve for obsolete and excess inventory was  and  respectively 
we regularly monitor our inventories for potential obsolete and excess inventory 
our reserve for obsolete and excess inventory is based upon our estimates of forecasts of unit sales  expected timing and impact of new product introductions  historical product demand  current economic trends  expected market acceptance of our products and expected customer buying patterns 
we adjust the cost basis of inventory that has been written down to reflect the net realizable value 
significant judgments and estimates are made when establishing the reserve for obsolete and excess inventory 
if these accounting judgments and estimates prove to be materially inaccurate  our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods valuation of goodwill netscout assesses goodwill for impairment at the enterprise level at least annually or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 
if the book value of our enterprise exceeds its fair value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess 

table of contents as of march   goodwill was million 
we consider the market capitalization of our outstanding common stock versus our stockholders equity as one indicator that may potentially trigger the need for an impairment of goodwill analysis 
at times  the market capitalization of our common stock may decline temporarily below our book value  however  we do not believe that any temporary decline below our book value would necessarily indicate impairment 
if adverse economic or industry trends or decrease in customer demand result in a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period in the future  we would need to assess an impairment loss 
significant judgments and estimates are made when assessing impairment 
if these accounting judgments and estimates prove to be materially inaccurate  an asset may be determined to be impaired and our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
likewise  if a future event or circumstance indicates that an impairment assessment is required and an asset is determined to be impaired  our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
as of march   there was no impairment of goodwill 
capitalization of software development costs and internal use software costs incurred in the research and development of netscout s products  including the various small point releases and small product enhancements which are released throughout each fiscal year  are expensed as incurred 
costs associated with the development of computer software are expensed prior to establishment of technological feasibility as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed and capitalized thereafter  until the related software products are available for first customer shipment 
judgment is required in determining the point at which technological feasibility has been met 
future major product enhancements  such as those included in our performance manager release in fiscal year  would be capitalized under the guidance of sfas no 
amortization of capitalized software development costs are recorded on a straight line basis over two years 
as of march   capitalized software development costs were million and accumulated amortization of capitalized software development costs was million  resulting in net capitalized software costs of  capitalized software development costs are subject to an ongoing assessment of recoverability based upon anticipated future revenue for the software products and changes in product technologies 
unamortized capitalized software development costs that are determined to be in excess of the net realizable value of the software product will be expensed in the period in which such a determination is made 
significant judgments and estimates are made when assessing the net realizable value of the unamortized software development costs 
if our accounting judgments and estimates prove to be materially inaccurate  we may expense such software development costs immediately and our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
netscout is implementing a new enterprise resource planning erp system in order to manage the growth and increasing complexity of our business and to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of our internal control over financial reporting 
certain costs that are incurred in the procurement and development of this erp system are capitalized in accordance with sop accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
preliminary project planning costs associated with the project were expensed as incurred 
once we executed contracts with third parties and committed to obtain the software system  capitalization began 
capitalized costs to date include fees paid for the purchase of software  fees paid to third parties to develop the software during the application development stage  and payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with and devote time to the software project 
general and administrative costs and overhead costs are not capitalized 
as of march   capitalized software for the erp system totaled  amortization of internal use software will be recorded on a straight line basis over five years once the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use  which is expected to be in the first half of fiscal year 
table of contents income taxes netscout estimates the quarterly income tax expense benefit based on our projected annual effective tax rate 
significant judgments and estimates are made when assessing netscout s projected annual effective tax rate 
in addition  we may record certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our tax positions 
our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes  rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions 
if these judgments and estimates prove to be materially inaccurate  our tax rate could fluctuate significantly and our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in the future 
netscout recognizes deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
we make an assessment of the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent that recovery is not believed to be more likely than not  a valuation allowance is established 
all available evidence  both positive and negative  is considered in the determination of recording a valuation allowance 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies when assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
while negative evidence exists that could suggest the need for a valuation allowance  such as our cumulative pre tax losses in recent prior years  these losses have continued to be reduced over the last three years and we recorded pre tax income for the fiscal year ended march  additional positive evidence consists of current cash balances  a strong balance sheet  solid technology  historically stable gross margins  projected future pre tax profits  as well as  a consistent earnings history for the fiscal years prior to fiscal years ended march   and  when we generated operating losses 
we believe future taxable income will be sufficient to realize the deferred tax benefit of the net deferred tax assets 
as of march   deferred income tax assets were million  consisting primarily of million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and  of federal research and development tax credits  which begin to expire in fiscal year  and million of other temporary differences 
significant accounting judgments and estimates are made when determining whether it is more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will not be realized and  accordingly  require a valuation allowance 
if these judgments and estimates prove to be materially inaccurate  a valuation allowance may be required and our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in the future 
if we determine that we will not be able to realize some or all of the deferred income taxes in the future  an adjustment to the deferred income tax assets will be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination is made

contracts that we enter into in the ordinary course of business may contain standard indemnification provisions 
pursuant to these agreements  we may agree to defend any third party claims brought against a partner or direct customer claiming infringement of such third party s i us and or eu patents  ii berne convention member country copyright  and or iii us  eu and or ohim trademark or intellectual property rights 
moreover  this indemnity may require netscout to pay any damages awarded against the partner or direct customer in such type of lawsuit as well as reimburse the partner or direct customer for any reasonable attorney s fees incurred by them from the lawsuit 
on very limited occasions  we may agree to provide other forms of indemnification to partners or direct customers  such as indemnification that would obligate us to defend and pay any damages awarded to a third party against a partner or direct customer based on a lawsuit alleging that such third party has suffered personal injury and or tangible property damage legally caused by negligently designed or manufactured products 
the term associated with these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual 
the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to pay arising from indemnification agreements may be limited to a certain monetary value 
however  the monetary exposure associated with the majority of these 
table of contents indemnification agreements is unlimited 
historically  we have incurred no costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to such indemnity agreements and we currently believe the estimated fair value of these agreements is immaterial 
if we were to have to defend a related lawsuit and settle claims  the costs could potentially have a material impact on our financial results 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities consist of the following year ending march  in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term marketable securities long term marketable securities cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities we have a line of credit with a bank  which allows us to borrow up to million for working capital purposes and to obtain letters of credit 
amounts available under the line of credit are a function of eligible accounts receivable  bear interest at the bank s prime rate and are collateralized by our inventory and accounts receivable 
as of march   we had a letter of credit secured under the line aggregating million relating to our current principal operating lease for our corporate headquarters 
the line of credit will expire on june  and we plan to renew the line of credit with substantially similar terms 
under the agreement we are required to comply with certain financial covenants  which require that netscout maintain minimum amounts of liquidity  the most restrictive of which is a minimum tangible net worth of no less than million 
as of march   we were in compliance with such covenants 
cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities increased by million from march  to march  while cash and cash equivalents increased by million  short and long term marketable securities decreased in total by million 
cash and cash equivalents were impacted by the following year ending march  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities amounted to million during the fiscal year ended march  the primary sources of operating cash flow in the fiscal year ended march  included net income of million  adjusted to exclude the effects of non cash items of million  an increase of million in accounts receivable as a result of the timing of sales within the fiscal year ended march   an increase of  in prepaids and other current assets mainly due to various prepayments of software maintenance contracts  marketing and sales events and restricted investments  a reduction of  in inventory due to inventory management  an increase of  in accounts payable due to the timing of payments  an increase of million in accrued compensation and other expenses primarily as a result of the timing of payroll cycles and non sales incentive compensation and sales commissions  and an increase in deferred revenue of million 
table of contents mainly due to an increase in the number of customer support agreements attributable to new product sales generated over the last fiscal year combined with continued renewals of customer support agreements from the expanding installed base

net cash provided by used in investing activities 
for the fiscal years ended march   and  cash provided by used in investing activities reflects the purchase of marketable securities of million  million and million  respectively  offset by the proceeds from the maturity of marketable securities due to cash management activities of million  million and million  respectively  and the purchase of fixed assets to support our infrastructure of million  million  and million  respectively 
the increase of purchases of fixed assets year over year is mainly due to the investment in our infrastructure in preparation for the extended future growth in our business 
included in the million in purchases is  for our new erp system which we anticipate will be operational in the first half of our fiscal year we anticipate that our investment in our infrastructure will continue in future quarters 
also  for the fiscal year ended march   cash provided by used in investing activities was reduced by the investment in capitalized software development costs related to ngenius performance manager of million 
net cash provided by financing activities 
for the fiscal years ended march    and  cash provided by financing activities was mainly due to proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan of million  million  and  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended march  cash provided by financing activities also reflected the purchase of treasury stock of  in connection with our open market stock repurchase program 
on september   netscout announced an open market stock repurchase program that enables netscout to purchase up to million shares of its outstanding common stock  subject to market conditions and other factors 
through the fiscal year ended march   netscout repurchased  shares of its common stock as treasury stock related to our open market stock repurchase program 
cash to be used under this program in the future is undeterminable at this point in time 

table of contents we believe that our cash balances  marketable securities classified as available for sale and any future cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
if demand for our products were to decrease substantially  our ability to generate cash flow sufficient for our short term working capital and expenditure could be materially impacted 
if our existing sources of liquidity are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or convertible debt securities 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
additionally  a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we evaluate potential acquisitions of such businesses  products or technologies 
in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended march   we announced the acquisition of quantiva 
the acquisition closed on april  the total purchase price for the acquisition is expected to be approximately million 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in march  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf no 
addresses disclosures about unrealized losses on available for sale debt and equity securities and the evaluation of other than temporary impairment related to securities accounted for under fasb statements no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the provisions of eitf no 
are effective for other than temporary impairment evaluations and disclosures in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of eitf no 
had no impact on netscout s financial position or operating results 
in september  the eitf reached a consensus that eitf no 
 the effect of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share will be effective for periods ending after december  eitf no states that contingently convertible securities co cos should be treated the same as other convertible securities and included in diluted eps computations if dilutive  regardless of whether market price conversion triggers have been met 
the potential shares associated with co cos should be included in diluted eps using the if converted method or the net share settlement method often referred to as the treasury stock method  depending on the means used to settle the conversion feature 
the adoption of eitf no 
had no impact on netscout s financial position or operating results 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this statement will provide investors and other users of financial statements with more complete and neutral financial information by requiring that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
this statement covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans  and replaces fasb sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
statement  as originally issued in  established a fair value based method of accounting for share based payment transactions with employees as the preferred methodology 
however  that statement permitted entities the option of continuing to apply the guidance in apb no 
 as long as the footnotes to financial statements disclosed what net income would have been had the preferable fair value based method been used 
public entities other than those filing as small business issuers will be required to apply sfas no 
r as of the annual reporting period that begins after june  in may netscout approved the acceleration of vesting of all stock options issued on or before december  that become exercisable on or after april   so that all of such options shall become fully exercisable on march  the purpose of this acceleration was to enable netscout to avoid recognizing stock based compensation expense associated with these options in future periods in our consolidated statements of operations upon the adoption of sfas no 
r  which becomes effective for netscout on april  irrespective of these accelerations  sfas no 
r will impact netscout s financial statements upon adoption 
netscout is continuing to evaluate this financial statement impact 

table of contents in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
amends arb  chapter  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  netscout does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on our financial position or operating results 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of non monetary assets amendment of abp opinion no 
sfas no 
is based on the principle that exchanges of non monetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged and it eliminates the narrow exceptions for non monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a broader exception for exchanges of non monetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
the provisions in sfas no 
are effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  netscout does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on our financial position or operating results 
the fasb has issued two fasb staff positions fsp that provide accounting guidance on how companies should account for the effects of the american jobs creation act of the ajca that was signed into law on october  the ajca provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities  which will be phased in from through the ajca also provides for temporary dividend deductions equal to of cash dividends received during the tax year from controlled foreign corporations and invested in the united states 
the result of this legislation could affect how companies report their deferred income tax balances 
the first fsp  fsp sfas  concludes that the tax relief from the qualified domestic production activities should be accounted for as a special deduction as described in fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the second fsp  fsp sfas  gives a company additional time to evaluate the effects of the ajca on any plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earning for purposes of applying fasb statement no 
netscout has not yet completed its evaluation of the provisions of the ajca 
the repatriation of foreign earnings would not have a material effect on netscout s consolidated financial statements 
netscout does not anticipate the repatriation of foreign earnings to the united states in the future 
certain factors which may impact future results our operating results and financial condition have varied in the past and may in the future vary significantly depending on a number of factors 
except for the historical information in this report  the matters contained in this report include forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this report 
additional risks that are not yet identified or that we currently think are immaterial may also impact our business operations 
such factors  among others  may have a material adverse impact upon our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate 
our quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
most of our expenses  such as employee compensation and rent  are relatively fixed in the short term 
moreover  our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations regarding future revenue levels 
as a result  if revenue for a particular quarter is below our expectations  we may not be able to reduce operating expenses proportionately for that quarter  and  therefore  this revenue shortfall would have a disproportionately negative impact on our operating results for that quarter 
our quarterly revenue may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control  including the following technology spending by current and potential customers  uneven demand for network management solutions  
table of contents the timing and receipt of orders from customers  especially in light of our lengthy sales cycle  the timing and market acceptance of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  distribution channels through which our products are sold could change  the timing of hiring sales personnel and the speed at which such personnel become productive  our inablility to anticipate or adapt effectively to developing markets and rapidly changing technologies  changes in our prices or the prices of our competitors products  and economic slowdowns or the occurrence of unforeseeable events  such as international terrorist attacks  which contribute to such slowdowns 
we operate with minimal backlog because our products typically are shipped shortly after orders are received 
as a result  product revenue in any quarter is substantially dependent upon orders booked and shipped in that quarter and revenue for any future quarter is not predictable to any degree of certainty 
therefore  any significant deferral of orders for our products would cause a shortfall in revenue for that quarter 
if we fail to introduce new products and enhance our existing products to keep up with rapid technological change  demand for our products may decline 
the market for network management solutions is characterized by rapid changes in technology  evolving industry standards  changes in customer requirements and frequent product introductions and enhancements 
our success is dependent upon our ability to meet our customers needs  which are driven by changes in computer networking technologies and the emergence of new industry standards 
in addition  new technologies may shorten the life cycle for our products or could render our existing or planned products obsolete 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new network and application infrastructure performance management products or enhancements to existing products in a timely and successful manner  it could have a material and adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we have and intend to continue to introduce new products related to our previously announced cdm technology strategy 
if the introduction of these products is significantly delayed or if we are not successful in selling these products to our current and potential customers  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted 
if our products contain errors  they may be costly to correct  revenue may be delayed  we could be sued and our reputation could be harmed 
despite testing by our customers and us  errors may be found in our products after commencement of commercial shipments 
if errors are discovered  we may not be able to successfully correct them in a timely manner or at all 
in addition  we may need to make significant expenditures of capital resources in order to eliminate errors and failures 
errors and failures in our products could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and could damage our reputation 
if one or more of our products fail  a customer may assert warranty and other claims for substantial damages against us 
the occurrence or discovery of these types of errors or failures could have a material and adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we face significant competition from other technology companies 
the market for network management solutions is intensely competitive 
we believe customers make network management system purchasing decisions based primarily upon the following factors product performance  functionality and price  name and reputation of vendor  distribution strength  and or alliances with industry partners 

table of contents we compete with providers of network performance management solutions  such as concord communications  inc which signed a definitive agreement on april  to be acquired by computer associates  inc  and providers of portable network traffic analyzers and probes  such as network general formerly network associates  inc 
in addition  leading network equipment providers  including cisco  could offer their own or competitors solutions in the future 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition and substantially greater financial  management  marketing  service  support  technical  distribution and other resources than we do 
therefore  they may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities  technologies  standards or customer requirements 
as a result of these and other factors  we may not be able to compete effectively with our current or future competitors  which could have a material and adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the success of our business depends on the continued growth in the market for and the commercial acceptance of network management solutions 
we derive all of our revenue from the sale of products and services that are designed to allow our customers to manage the performance of computer networks 
therefore  we must be able to predict the appropriate features and prices for future products to address the market  the optimal distribution strategy and the future changes to the competitive environment 
in order for us to be successful  our potential customers must recognize the value of more sophisticated network management solutions  decide to invest in the management of their networks and  in particular  adopt our management solutions 
any failure of this market to continue to be viable would materially and adversely impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
additionally  businesses may choose to outsource the management of their networks to service providers 
our business may depend on our ability to continue to develop relationships with these service providers and successfully market our products to them 
the current economic and geopolitical environment may impact some specific sectors into which we sell 
many of our customers are concentrated in a small number of sectors  including financial services  government  health and medical  and telecommunications 
certain sectors may be more acutely affected by economic  geopolitical and other factors than other sectors 
to the extent that one or more of the sectors in which our customer base operates are adversely impacted  whether as a result of general conditions affecting all sectors or as a result of conditions affecting only those particular sectors  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted 
our success depends on our ability to expand and manage our international operations 
sales outside north america accounted for  and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
we currently expect international revenue to continue to account for a significant percentage of total revenue in the future 
we believe that we must continue to expand our international sales activities in order to be successful 
our international sales growth will be limited if we are unable to expand international indirect distribution channels  hire additional sales personnel  adapt products for local markets  and manage geographically dispersed operations 
the major countries outside of north america in which we do or intend to do business are the united kingdom  germany  japan and china 
our international operations  including our operations in the united kingdom  germany  japan and china  are generally subject to a number of risks  including failure of local laws to provide the same degree of protection as the laws in the united states provide against infringement of our intellectual property  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competitors  dependence on local indirect channel partners  
table of contents multiple conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations  longer sales cycles  greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and political and economic instability 
our success depends on our ability to manage indirect distribution channels 
sales to our indirect distribution channels accounted for  and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
to increase our sales going forward we need to continue to enhance our direct sales efforts and to continue to develop new and further expand and manage existing indirect distribution channels  including original equipment manufacturers  distributors  resellers  systems integrators and service providers 
our indirect channel partners have no obligation to purchase any products from us 
in addition  they could internally develop products that compete with our solutions or partner with our competitors or bundle or resell competitors solutions  possibly at lower prices 
the potential inability to develop new relationships and to expand and manage our existing relationships with partners  the potential inability or unwillingness of our partners to effectively market and sell our products or the loss of existing partnerships could have a material and adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the non renewal of our resale agreement with cisco requires that we sell our product directly to end user customers 
license and royalty revenue and service revenue from cisco accounted for   and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
as announced in our report on form k filed on september   following discussions between netscout and cisco regarding netscout s plan to terminate support for its legacy product  real time monitor  cisco announced its intention to discontinue reselling real time monitor as of november  the announcement was contained in a letter dated september   notifying netscout of the non renewal of the agreements by and between netscout and cisco 
pursuant to the foregoing and the terms of the agreements  the agreements will expire on june  at present  netscout will continue to recognize license and royalty revenue based upon reported product shipments by cisco 
cisco has recently indicated that the resale of real time monitor ceased on february   therefore  the final product shipments report will be received in the first quarter of fiscal year netscout is offering cisco real time monitor customers a purchase incentive to migrate to ngenius performance manager if we are unable to sell ngenius performance manager to these customers or if cisco were to decide to internally develop products that compete with our solutions  partner with our competitors or bundle or sell competitors solutions  possibly at lower prices  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted 
our future growth depends on our ability to maintain and periodically expand our sales force 
we must maintain and periodically increase the size of our sales force in order to increase our direct sales and support our indirect sales channels 
because our products are very technical  sales people require a long period of time to become productive  typically three to twelve months 
this lag in productivity  as well as the challenge of attracting qualified candidates  may make it difficult to meet our sales force growth targets 
further  we may not generate sufficient sales to offset the increased expense resulting from growing our sales force 
if we are unable to successfully maintain and periodically expand our sales capability  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted 
we must hire and retain skilled personnel 
our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract  train  motivate and retain highly skilled employees  particularly sales and marketing personnel  software engineers  and technical support personnel 
if we are unable to attract and retain the highly skilled technical personnel that are integral to our sales  marketing  product development and technical support teams  the rate at which we can generate sales and develop new products or product enhancements may be limited 
this inability could have a material and adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents loss of key personnel could adversely impact our business 
our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills  experience and efforts of anil singhal  our president  chief executive officer and co founder  and narendra popat  our chairman of the board and co founder 
we also depend on the ability of our other executive officers and senior managers to work effectively as a team 
the loss of one or more of our key personnel could have a material and adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our reliance on sole source suppliers could adversely impact our business 
many components that are necessary for the assembly of our probes are obtained from separate sole source suppliers or a limited group of suppliers 
these components include some of our network interface cards 
our reliance on sole or limited suppliers involves several risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components and reduced control over pricing  quality and timely delivery of components 
we do not generally maintain long term agreements with any of our suppliers or large volumes of inventory 
our inability to obtain adequate deliveries or the occurrence of any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of these components would impact our ability to ship our products on a timely basis 
this could damage relationships with our current and prospective customers  cause shortfalls in expected revenue  and could materially and adversely impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
our success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 
our business is heavily dependent on our intellectual property 
we rely upon a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and non disclosure and other contractual arrangements to protect our proprietary rights 
the reverse engineering  unauthorized copying  or other misappropriation of our intellectual property could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without compensating us 
legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights could be burdensome and expensive and could involve a high degree of uncertainty 
in addition  legal proceedings may divert management s attention from growing our business 
there can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information  or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use by third parties and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
further  we also license software from third parties for use as part of our products  and if any of these licenses were to terminate  we may experience delays in product shipment until we develop or license alternative software 
others may claim that we infringe on their intellectual property rights 
we may be subject to claims by others that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights  patents  copyrights or trademarks 
these claims  whether or not valid  could require us to spend significant sums in litigation  pay damages  delay product shipments  reengineer our products  rename our products and rebuild name recognition or acquire licenses to such third party intellectual property 
we may not be able to secure any required licenses on commercially reasonable terms or secure them at all 
we expect that these claims could become more frequent as more companies enter the market for network and application infrastructure performance management solutions 
any of these claims or resulting events could have a material and adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may fail to secure necessary additional financing 
we may require significant capital resources to expand our business and remain competitive in the rapidly changing network performance management industry 
we may invest in our operations as well as acquire complementary businesses  products or technologies 
our future success may depend in part on our ability to obtain additional financing to support our continued growth and operations 
if our existing sources of liquidity are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to raise capital by issuing additional common stock or other equity instruments  issuing debt securities  obtaining additional lease financings  or increasing our lines of credit 

table of contents however  we may not be able to obtain additional capital when we want or need it  and capital may not be available on satisfactory terms 
furthermore  any additional capital may have terms and conditions that adversely affect our business  such as financial or operating covenants  or that may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we may not successfully complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions we do make  which could impair our ability to compete and could harm our operating results 
we may need to acquire complementary businesses  products or technologies to remain competitive or expand our business 
we actively investigate and evaluate potential acquisitions of complementary businesses  products and technologies in the ordinary course of business 
we may compete for acquisition opportunities with entities having significantly greater resources than us 
as a result  we may not succeed in acquiring some or all businesses  products or technologies that we seek to acquire 
in april  we acquired substantially all assets and operations of quantiva  a provider of automated analytics solutions for application performance management 
the total purchase price for the acquisition is million 
our inability to effectively consummate acquisitions on favorable terms could significantly impact our ability to effectively compete in our targeted markets and could negatively affect our results of operations 
further acquisitions that we do complete could adversely impact our business 
the potential adverse consequences from acquisitions  such as quantiva  include the potentially dilutive issuance of common stock or other equity instruments  the incurrence of debt and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  the incurrence of significant costs and expenses  or the potentially dilutive impact on our earnings per share 
acquisition transactions also involve numerous business risks 
these risks from acquisitions  such as quantiva  include difficulties in assimilating the acquired operations  technologies  personnel and products  difficulties in managing geographically dispersed and international operations  difficulties in assimilating diverse financial reporting and management information systems  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the potential disruption of our business  and the potential loss of key employees  customers  distributors or suppliers 
our estimates and judgments related to critical accounting policies could be inaccurate 
we consider accounting policies related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of inventories  valuation of goodwill  capitalized software development costs and internal use software  and income taxes to be critical in fully understanding and evaluating our financial results 
management makes certain significant accounting judgments and estimates related to these policies 
our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods if our accounting judgments and estimates related to these critical accounting policies prove to be inaccurate 
failure to properly manage growth and to implement enhanced automated systems could adversely impact our business 
the growth in size and complexity of our business and our customer base has been and will continue to be a challenge to our management and operations 
to manage further growth effectively  we must integrate new personnel and manage expanded operations 
we must also implement a new enterprise resource planning erp system in order to manage the growth and increasing complexity of our business operations and to enhance our internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with sarbanes oxley 
our erp selection process is complete and we began implementation efforts in the first quarter of our fiscal year 
table of contents ending march   with the new erp system anticipated to be operational during the first half of our fiscal year if we are unable to effectively manage our growth  our costs  the quality of our products  the effectiveness of our sales organization  our retention of key personnel and the implementation of our new erp system  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted 
the effectiveness of our disclosure and internal controls may be limited 
our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent all errors and intentional misrepresentations 
any system of internal control can only provide reasonable assurance that all control objectives are met 
some of the potential risks involved could include but are not limited to management judgments  simple errors or mistakes  willful misconduct regarding controls or misinterpretation 
there is no guarantee that existing controls will prevent or detect all material issues or that existing controls will be effective in future conditions  which could materially and adversely impact our financial results 
under section of sarbanes oxley  we are required to evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
compliance with this legislation requires management s attention and resources and will continue to cause us to incur significant expense 
management s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting may identify weaknesses that need to be addressed in our internal controls over financial reporting or other matters that may raise concerns for investors 
should we determine that we have material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting  our results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected or the price of our common stock may decline 
although we have received a favorable assessment of our internal controls from our auditors for this annual report  in future years we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any changes necessary to make a favorable assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting or we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any requested improvements and receiving a favorable attestation 
if in future annual reports we cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting  or if our independent auditors are unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on our assessment  the price of our common stock may decline 
in order to continue the enhancement of our internal control over financial reporting and to manage the growth and increasing complexity of our business  we are in the process of implementing a new erp system which is expected to be completed in the first half of fiscal year if we are unable to successfully implement this system  our internal controls over financial reporting could be adversely impacted and this could have a material and adverse impact on our financial results in the future 
the price of our common stock may decrease due to market volatility 
the market price of our common stock has been highly volatile and has fluctuated significantly since the initial public offering of our common stock on august  the market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
trading activity of our stock tends to be minimal  in part as a result of officers and directors and their affiliates holding a significant percentage of our stock 
in addition  the market prices of securities of technology companies have been extremely volatile and have experienced fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
also  broad market fluctuations could adversely impact the market price of our common stock  which in turn could cause impairment of goodwill that could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
recently  when the market price of a stock has been volatile  holders of that stock have occasionally instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issues that stock 
if any of our stockholders brought such a lawsuit against us  even if the lawsuit is without merit  we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit 
the lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we consider all highly liquid marketable securities purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents and those with maturities greater than three months are considered to be marketable securities 
cash equivalents and short term marketable securities are stated at cost plus accrued interest  which approximates fair value 
long term marketable securities are stated at fair value based on quoted market prices 
cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of money market instruments and us treasury bills 
netscout s primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure  but do not believe that a fluctuation in interest rates would have a material impact on the value of our cash equivalents 
netscout s exposure to interest rates based on outstanding debt has been and is expected to continue to be modest due to the fact that we currently have a million line of credit with million of letters of credit secured against it and we have no amounts outstanding under the line and no other outstanding interest bearing debt 
netscout s exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations has been limited 
all revenue transactions are executed in us dollars 
netscout pays for certain foreign operating expenses such as foreign payroll  rent and office expense in foreign currency and  therefore  currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material and adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
currently  netscout does not engage in foreign currency hedging activities 
the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations is recorded in the period incurred
