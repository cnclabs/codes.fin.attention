table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in canada cdn gaap 
for a reconciliation to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in this form k  we use the terms total production cost per ounce  total cash cost per ounce and cash operating cost per ounce 
total production cost per ounce is equal to total production costs as found on our consolidated statement of operations divided by the ounces of gold sold in the period 
total production costs include all mine site operating costs  including the costs of mining  processing  maintenance  work in process inventory changes  mine site overhead  production taxes and royalties  depreciation  depletion  amortization  asset retirement obligations and by product credits  but does not include exploration costs  corporate general and administrative expenses  impairment charges  corporate business development costs  gains and losses on asset sales  interest expense  foreign currency gains and losses  gains and losses on investments and income tax 
total cash cost per ounce is equal to total production costs  as found on our consolidated statement of operations less depreciation  depletion  amortization and asset retirement obligation accretion divided by the number of ounces of gold sold during the period 
cash operating cost per ounce is equal to total cash costs for the period less production royalties and production taxes  divided by the number of ounces of gold sold during the period 
the following table shows the derivation of these measures and a reconciliation of total cash cost per ounce and cash operating cost per ounce 
ounces sold in thousands of mining operation expense depreciation  depletion amortization accretion of asset retirement obligations total production costs gaap in per ounce total production cost per ounce gaap less depreciation  depletion amortization less accretion of asset retirement obligation total cash cost per ounce total cash cost per ounce less royalties and production taxes cash operating cost per ounce these calculations of cash operating cost per ounce and total cash costs per ounce are in compliance with an industry standard for such measures as established in by the gold institute  a non profit industry group 
we use total cash cost per ounce and cash operating cost per ounce as key operating indicators 
we monitor these measures monthly  comparing each month s values to prior period s values to detect trends that may indicate increases or decreases in operating efficiencies 
these measures are also compared against budget to alert 
table of contents management to trends that may cause actual results to deviate from planned operational results 
we provide these measures to our investors to allow them to also monitor operational efficiencies of our mines 
we calculate these measures for both individual operating units and on a consolidated basis 
total cash cost per ounce and cash operating cost per ounce should be considered as non gaap financial measures as defined in sec regulation s k item and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
there are material limitations associated with the use of such non gaap measures 
since these measures do not incorporate revenues  changes in working capital and non operating cash costs  they are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under gaap 
changes in numerous factors including  but not limited to  mining rates  milling rates  gold grade  gold recovery  and the costs of labor  consumables and mine site general and administrative activities can cause these measures to increase or decrease 
we believe that these measures are the same or similar to the measures of other gold mining companies  but may not be comparable to similarly titled measures in every instance 
all figures and amounts in this item are shown on a basis  which represents our current beneficial interest in gold production and revenues 
once all capital has been repaid  the government of ghana would receive of the dividends from the subsidiaries owning the bogoso prestea and wassa mines 
our business through our subsidiaries and joint ventures we own a controlling interest in three significant gold properties in southern ghana in west africa the bogoso prestea property bogoso prestea  the wassa property wassa and the prestea underground property prestea underground 
bogoso and prestea are adjoining properties  operating as a single operation and referred to as bogoso prestea 
bogoso prestea and the prestea underground are owned by our owned subsidiary bogoso gold limited bgl 
in we sold  ounces of gold from bogoso prestea for an average gold price of approximately per ounce having a cash operating cost of approximately per ounce 
essentially all of our gold production to date has come from bogoso prestea 
through another owned subsidiary  wexford goldfields limited wgl  we own the wassa gold property  located some kilometers east of bogoso prestea 
a newly constructed ore processing plant at wassa is now in its commissioning and testing phase  processing heap leach materials left by a former owner 
we expect that the new plant will achieve its full design capacity of  tonnes per day in the first quarter of the prestea underground is located on the prestea property and consists of a currently inactive underground gold mine and associated support facilities 
as of december   bgl  our owned subsidiary  owned a operating interest in this mine 
we are currently seeking to determine if the underground mine can be reactivated on a profitable basis 
we hold interests in exploration joint ventures  managed by joint venture partners  in mali and sierra leone in west africa and hold active exploration properties in ghana  suriname and french guiana 
we hold interests in gold exploration properties in peru and chile through our affiliate goldmin holdings  and in the democratic republic of the congo through an investment in moto goldmines limited 
our corporate headquarters is located in littleton  colorado 
our accounting records are kept in compliance with canadian gaap and all of our operations  except for the french guiana office  transact business in us dollars and keep financial records in us dollars 
business strategy and development since our business and development strategy has been focused primarily on the acquisition of producing and development stage gold properties in ghana and on the exploration  development and operation of these properties 
we also explore for gold 
since our exploration efforts have been focused on ghana  other west african countries and south america 
we are currently carrying out technical and environmental studies to expand production at bogoso prestea 
we commenced development at wassa in mid  and expect it to be fully operational in early if the above mentioned expansion and development plans at bogoso prestea are approved and permitted as expected  our annualized production is expected to range between  and  ounces of 
table of contents gold by achievement of this target is subject to numerous risks 
see the discussion of risk factors in item above 
our overall objective is to grow our business to become a mid tier gold producer which we understand to be a producer with annual production of approximately  ounces over the next few years 
as part of the effort to achieve our goal  we are actively investigating potential acquisition and merger candidates 
however  we presently have no agreement or understanding with respect to any specific potential transaction 
trends and events operational summary gold production totaled  ounces in  down from  ounces in production during was adversely affected by mining and processing difficulties experienced in the latter part of the year as the bogoso prestea processing plant transitioned from oxide ores to transition and non refractory sulfide ores which are not as well suited for processing in the bogoso plant as were the oxide ores milled earlier in the year 
start up difficulties with the new flotation circuit and unusually high rainfall during the second and third quarters also reduced mine output and hampered efficient plant operations 
to compensate for the ore shortage  the bogoso plant supplemented the pit ore with stockpiled ores which were also not very well suited for processing in the bogoso plant 
the net result was a lower processing rate and reduced gold recovery which in turn reduced gold output and sales revenues as compared to additional information on operations is contained below in the result of operations section 
the lower revenues resulted in earnings of million during  down from million in earnings were also reduced by million of expenses related to the iamgold tender offer 
guyanor and guiana shield restructuring work continued throughout the year on the restructuring plan for guyanor ressources sa guyanor  a owned subsidiary and our other guiana shield assets in south america 
the goal of the restructuring plan is to establish guyanor as an independent and economically viable entity which will no longer be dependent on golden star for funding and which will at the same time bring new value to golden star s investment in guyanor 
the august guyanor restructuring agreement provided for  among other things  a new business model for guyanor as a metals royalty entity  restructuring of the inter company debt owed by guyanor to golden star and an opportunity for golden star to acquire a direct interest in certain french guiana exploration assets 
the restructuring plan accomplished the following during the year new management guyanor s managing director resigned and a new managing director was appointed 
the new management acquired nine million of guyanor s common shares from golden star for a nominal amount reducing golden star s ownership of guyanor to approximately 
new business plan guyanor changed its business focus from gold exploration to metals royalties 
in line with the new focus  guyanor and golden star each transferred their ownership in the yaou and dorlin properties to a newly formed private company managed by guyanor s former management 
the new owner has agreed to pay a production royalty to guyanor and a production royalty to golden star from any future gold production from yaou and dorlin 
the class a and class b shares were merged into a single class of stock which continues to trade on the toronto stock exchange and the nouveau march of the paris bourse 
guyanor s office in french guiana was closed and all local french guiana employees were terminated or transferred to golden star by year end 
exploration rights to guyanor s paul isnard property were optioned to golden star in an earn in agreement that provides golden star the right to acquire up to of the square kilometer property via a series of option payments and exploration spending 
golden star s earn in payments will be netted against the loan owed to golden star by guyanor as of the date of the agreement 
golden star also purchased guyanor s french guiana geologic data base  the million price also being netted against the loan guyanor owed to golden star 

table of contents further provisions of the restructuring agreement resulted in golden star s forgiveness of the remaining balance of the loan 
in december an agreement was closed which transferred ownership of the rosebel royalty from golden star to guyanor for a price of million 
upon closure of the sale  guyanor recorded a new million inter company payable due to golden star 
in january  guyanor drew down million under a credit facility from a bank and paid the funds to golden star as the first installment on the sale price 
the bank loan is repayable in nine equal payments of  beginning july  and every three months thereafter 
the interest rate is set at libor plus 
interest is payable at the end of each  or month period as the borrower may choose 
guyanor is now in the process of seeking additional funding  some or all of which is expected to be equity funding  to pay the second million installment due golden star by june  on the rosebel royalty and to allow guyanor to fund its ongoing activities 
covenants in the january loan agreement preclude guyanor from acquiring any additional debt without the bank s approval 
if guyanor is successful in obtaining equity funding  it is possible that golden star s ownership position could be diluted below and at that point we would expect that guyanor would no longer be consolidated with golden star 
as required by the loan agreement  guyanor entered into a cash settled forward sales agreement in january with a financial institution which obligates guyanor to sell  ounces of gold to the financial institution at the end of each three month period  beginning april  and every three months thereafter until july  when the average gold price for the prior three month period is less than per ounce  the financial institution will pay an amount to guyanor equal to the difference between the average price and times  ounces 
if the prior three month average price exceeds per ounce guyanor will pay the financial institution an amount equal to the difference between the average price and per ounce times  ounces 
the hedge is structured to offset the floating price nature of the rosebel royalty by tying the royalty payments to a gold price of per ounce 
bon espoir property acquisition in october we acquired a interest in the square kilometer bon espoir exploration property in french guiana from gold fields exploration bv for a purchase price of million paid in golden star common shares and million of transaction costs 
the bon espoir property is located north of our paul isnard property in a geological setting interpreted by us as having many similarities to the ashanti trend area of ghana 
iamgold tender offer in  we made an unsolicited tender offer to the shareholders of iamgold corporation 
on august   iamgold announced that it had agreed to combine iamgold s mining assets with certain gold mining assets of another international gold mining company to form a new gold mining company 
iamgold s management and board subsequently recommended acceptance of this plan to their shareholders 
after analyzing this development we concluded that it was not in the best interests of our shareholders to continue our offer for iamgold  and our board of directors elected not to extend our tender offer which expired on august no shares of iamgold were acquired 
we incurred approximately million of direct  incremental acquisition costs resulting from the tender offer which were expensed in the third quarter 
the majority of these costs were for legal  financial advisory  printing and accounting services 
gold prices gold prices have generally trended upward during most of the last three and a half years  from a low of just under per ounce in early to a high of in late much of the price increase has been attributed to a decrease in the value of the us dollar versus other major foreign currencies 
our realized gold price for shipments during averaged per ounce  substantially above the per ounce average price received in change in ore type the bogoso processing plant completed processing plant north oxide ore during the second quarter of and subsequently processed exclusively transition and non refractory sulfide ores from the plant north pit and from 
table of contents stockpiles during the balance of the year  resulting in lower production and increased production costs 
the bogoso processing plant is scheduled to continue processing transition and non refractory sulfide ores until when construction of a biox bio oxidation circuit is scheduled for completion  after which the bogoso plant is expected to process refractory sulfide and transition ores 
in anticipation of the transition from oxide to transition and non refractory sulfide ore in mid  the bogoso processing plant flotation circuit was redesigned  re built and commissioned in the second quarter of and is now being used to assist in obtaining higher recoveries from the more complex transition ores 
the total capital cost for the upgraded flotation circuit  which was managed in house and which will become a component of the future biox project  was approximately million 
based on metallurgical test work completed in the combination of gravity  flotation and intensive cyanide leaching of transition material was forecast to increase gold recoveries from plant north transition ores to a range of to compared to recoveries in the range of to for carbon in leach alone 
since commissioning the flotation plant  gold recovery from the bogoso processing plant has averaged approximately 
we are working to optimize the milling process and to achieve higher recoveries in deferred stripping policy we initiated a deferred waste stripping policy at the plant north pit on the prestea property in the third quarter of in the past  most of our pits have been relatively shallow and short lived because the bogoso plant could effectively process only near surface ores that had been naturally oxidized by relatively shallow ground water 
with recent processing plant modifications we are now able to process certain deeper ores found at prestea 
as a result we anticipate deeper pits with longer lives than in the past 
as such  a continuation of our current policy of expensing waste costs as incurred would result in a misallocation of stripping costs and associated revenues between accounting periods 
a total of million of plant north deferred waste stripping cost  which would have been included in operating costs under our previous policy  was capitalized in engineering forecasts indicate that the plant north pit should continue to strip waste in excess of the plant north average strip rate for the first nine months of followed by approximately three months of stripping below the average rate which will continue through the end of the pit s life 
at july   the date of the deferred stripping policy implementation  we estimated there were million tonnes of waste remaining in the plant north pit and million tonnes of ore 
the amount of stripping costs to be capitalized is determined each quarter by determining the tonnes of waste moved in excess of the life of pit average and valuing them at the average mining cost per tonne during the period 
costs are recovered in periods when the actual tonnes of waste moved are less than what would have been moved at the average life of pit rate  such tonnes being valued at the rolling average cost of the waste tonnage amounts capitalized 
we have included capitalized waste cost with mining properties on our consolidated balance sheets 
the cost impact is included in the statements of operations in the line item titled mining operations 
in periods when the strip ratio exceeds the pit average  the costs of the excess stripping are excluded from our cost per ounce calculations 
in periods when the strip ratio is less than the pit average  capitalized waste costs are added back to operating costs and included in cost per ounce calculations 
illegal mining we experienced a significant increase in illegal mining activity on the prestea property during involving an estimated  or more illegal miners 
most of this activity is in the beta boundary area south of prestea and includes areas where we have established reserves 
while it is difficult to quantify the exact impact of this activity on our reserves and mineral resources  it now appears  based on a preliminary survey completed in september that between  and  ounces may have been removed by the illegal activity 
the impact of this illegal mining  to the extent known  on our reserves and mineral resources has been taken into account in calculating year end reserve figures 
we continue to work with local  regional and national governmental authorities and have requested that they take a more active role in protecting our property rights on a more timely basis 
the preferred solution to this situation is the establishment of a separate small scale mining area  away from our mining licenses  where the illegal miners can operate officially under the control of the relevant governmental agencies 
plans to provide such an area and to 
table of contents provide independent funding to effect this relocation are underway 
in addition to the operational and economic impact  we are concerned about the environmental degradation and safety issues where the illegal miners are operating 
prestea underground restructuring in late  our ghanaian partner in the prestea underground joint venture filed for bankruptcy 
this event resulted in our partner relinquishing its rights under the joint venture agreement and transferring its remaining ownership position to bgl thereby giving bgl ownership in the prestea underground 
the government of ghana continues to hold a ownership in prestea underground  resulting in beneficial ownership by golden star 
royalty income during we began receiving royalty payments from the rosebel mine in suriname that we sold to cambior inc in royalty income of approximately million was recorded in the rosebel mine did not begin operations until early and thus there were no comparable royalty revenues for as mentioned above  effective december  we sold our rights in the rosebel royalty to our owned subsidiary  guyanor  for million 
the first million installment was paid in january and we expect the remaining million to be paid to us before the end of june results of operations compared to net income for totaled million or per share on revenues of million  versus net income of million or per share on revenues of million during higher gold prices and ore grades were more than offset by decreased gold production  higher costs per ounce and million of corporate development expenses mostly related to the tender offer for iamgold 
recognition of future tax assets added million to net income in versus nil in the prior year 
realized gold prices averaged per ounce for the year  a increase from the per ounce realized in gold revenues were based on sales of  ounces  a decrease from  ounces in as explained in the trends and events section above  the change in ore type during was the major factor contributing to the reduced gold output versus the prior year 
during we processed exclusively oxide ores while during most of we processed harder and more complex transition and non refractory sulfide ores which  due to the harder ore and complex metallurgy  resulted in lower gold recovery and lower plant throughput 
we processed a mixture of oxide  transition and non refractory sulfide ores in the first half of and a mixture of transition and non refractory ores in the second half of the year 
gold recovery averaged during the first half of but dropped to approximately in the second half 
plant throughput averaged  tonnes per day in the first half of the year but dropped to  tonnes per day in the second half 
unusually high rainfall also impeded ore availability and plant efficiency in the third quarter due to flooding in the pit and wet ore handling problems at the processing plant 
financial results gold sold ounces average price realized revenues in thousands net income in thousands net income per share basic 
table of contents as anticipated  operating costs increased both in absolute terms and on a per unit basis at bogoso prestea during due primarily to the harder nature of the transition and non refractory sulfide ores processed after april increases in fuel and electric power costs added approximately million to operating costs during the year 
plant maintenance  explosives  liner costs and grinding media costs all increased by a total of approximately million as compared to the harder ore also required increased amounts of certain consumables which increased costs by another million 
we also experienced increased costs in other maintenance areas  labor  community assistance  camp costs and other overhead areas 
a reduction in work in process inventory and a million provision for redundancies also contributed to the higher costs 
the lower gold output and higher mine operating costs resulted in a significant increase in unit costs 
cash operating costs averaged per ounce  compared to per ounce in  and total cash costs averaged per ounce  up from per ounce in depreciation and amortization were higher than in mostly due to the amortization costs of new assets added in late and in such as the flotation plant at bogoso 
increases in corporate general and administrative costs contributed to the lower income versus higher compensation costs relating to additional administrative personnel relative to  increases in investor relations costs  higher insurance costs  sarbanes oxley compliance costs and an overall higher level of corporate activity in response to the growth of the company all contributed to the increase in general and administrative costs 
a million tax benefit was recorded during recognition of a deferred tax asset was deemed appropriate at the end of in light of the continued ghanaian operating profits at bgl 
we have substantial tax assets in canada and france mostly due to past losses  capital allowances and tax pools  but a tax valuation allowance has been provided in an amount equal to net tax assets in these jurisdictions 
bogoso prestea operations ore mined t waste mined t ore milled t grade milled g t recovery cash operating cost per ounce royalties per ounce total cash cost per ounce the bogoso processing plant processed an average of  tonnes per day in  down from  tonnes per day in all of the ore processed in came from the plant north ore body and from old bogoso transition ore stockpiles 
the average ore grade processed in was grams per tonne  up from grams per tonne in  but gold recovery dropped to from in lower recovery was directly related to the non refractory sulfide ores and to the transition ores which typically have lower recoveries than the oxide ores milled in compared to net income totaled million or per share on revenues of million for  versus net income of million or per share on revenues of million during higher gold prices  increased gold production  a million gain on currency exchange rates and a million gain on the sale of marketable securities were the major factors contributing to the earnings improvement 
realized gold prices averaged per ounce for the year  a increase from the per ounce realized in a weakened us dollar in versus most other major world currencies is thought to be responsible for much of the increased gold price during 
table of contents gold revenues for were based on sales of  ounces  a  ounce increase from  ounces in increases in the grade milled and in gold recoveries were the major factors responsible for higher gold production in as compared to while prestea property oxides were the main feed source to the bogoso processing plant in both and in  start up of the higher grade plant north mine at prestea at the end of yielded a much higher grade during than did the other prestea oxide pits mined during as a result  the milled head grade increased from grams per tonne in to grams per tonne in  and yielded higher recoveries 
higher depreciation  depletion and amortization costs are related to higher gold production versus general and administrative costs rose by million from due to increases in compensation expense  including stock option expense  purchase of gold puts  travel and tax and other professional services related to an expanded scope of corporate activities 
the increase in foreign exchange gains is mostly related to the effect of a weakening us dollar offset by the associated impact on the value of cash equivalents invested in canadian dollar instruments 
we did not record a tax expense or benefit during while we have substantial tax assets in canada  france and ghana from past losses  capital allowances and tax pools  a tax valuation allowance has been provided in an amount equal to our net tax assets 
during  bogoso prestea processed an average of  tonnes per day of plant north ore at an average grade of grams per tonne 
this compares to  tonnes per day at grams per tonne in the lower processing plant throughput was related to increased amounts of transition ores versus mechanical difficulties with a long lead time component of the processing plant conveyor system during the second quarter of and other processing plant maintenance projects during the year also contributed to the reduced processing plant through put 
recoveries rose to  up from in the improved grade and better recoveries combined to yield a increase in gold production versus bogoso prestea sold  ounces of gold in  up from  ounces in cash operating costs of per ounce were better than the per ounce costs during similarly  total cash costs fell from per ounce in to per ounce in the current year 
expansion projects bogoso plant upgrade planning and engineering continued during for the proposed bogoso processing plant biox bio oxidation conversion project 
current plans as approved in principle by our board of directors in january  call for conversion of the bogoso processing plant to a bio oxidation process to treat million tonnes per year of refractory sulfide and other ores from the bogoso prestea property 
in we issued a letter of intent to grd minproc limited for the detailed design of the biox circuit and to carry out the construction under a project management contract 
completion of detailed engineering is expected in the second quarter of we estimate that the total capital cost for the biox upgrade at the bogoso processing plant to fall between to million  plus an additional million for mining equipment 
separately  work on an environmental impact assessment is underway and we expect to present it to the authorities in the first quarter of and would expect to receive the environmental permits as early as the second quarter of recent engineering studies have indicated that a larger scale operation than was originally envisioned would add to the profitability of the project 
the proprietary biox bio oxidation process has been used to treat refractory gold ores and concentrates for over years 
a total of six biox operations have been successfully commissioned since commercialization of the process  of which four are still operating 
two new biox plants are currently under construction  the suzdal plant in kazahstan and the fosterville plant in australia  which are scheduled for commissioning during four additional biox plants are now in various stages of development and are currently scheduled for commissioning during and one of the larger bio oxidation plants which was built by grd minproc in the mid s  is located at anglogold ashanti s obuasi mine  which is also located on the ashanti gold trend  kilometers northeast of bogoso prestea 
we believe that the sulfide mineralization at obuasi is similar to the bogoso prestea material 
our metallurgical assessment of the suitability of the bio oxidation process for bogoso prestea ores has been a four year project 
the work has involved metallurgical assessments on some samples representative of the current sulfide reserves  including a flotation  biox and neutralization pilot plant program on a nine tonne bulk sample compiled by the blending of approximately diamond drill hole cores 

table of contents upon completion of the biox upgrade  the bogoso processing plant is expected to have a nominal capacity of million tonnes per annum to process refractory sulfide ores from our bogoso and northern prestea pits  where we currently have proven and probable refractory reserves of approximately million tonnes at an average grade of grams per tonne 
gold production from the bogoso mill  following a mining fleet upgrade and installation of the bogoso biox circuit  is expected to average approximately  ounces per annum and to vary between  to  ounces per annum at an average cash operating cost between to per ounce after commercial production is achieved in estimated gold recoveries from the biox process are expected to average and vary between and 
wassa gold mine while we experienced significant construction delays during  the construction phase of the wassa project was substantially complete by december  except for the power line which is now under construction and which we expect to complete by mid year following discussions in november  our contract with mdm was terminated on november  all of the required power line permits have been obtained  and all of the material power line construction equipment has been delivered and staged for construction or are on order 
while the power line is still under construction  the existing powerhouse at wassa should generate all of the power needed to fully operate the plant and associated facilities until the connection to the local power grid is completed 
as of december  acquisition and development costs totaled million including feasibility study costs  development drilling and geology  operating equipment and plant and site construction costs 
the remaining project costs at december  are estimated to be million  consisting of million for completion of the power line and million for completion of miscellaneous items at the plant site 
an additional million is also budgeted in for purchase of additional mining equipment 
during while testing and commissioning the mine we poured  ounces of gold resulting in million of preproduction revenues which were credited against mine development costs 
commissioning and testing of the new wassa processing plant began in late by december wassa had poured  ounces of gold resulting in million of preproduction revenues which were credited against mine development costs 
we expect wassa will achieve commercial production during the first quarter of  processing at its design capacity of approximately  tonnes per day 
our mining plan involves processing most of the heap leach material left on the pads by the former owner which will furnish a low cost ore feed to the new plant during its first year of operations and will also clear the pad area for use as a tailings dam site 
mining will be performed initially using a mixture of equipment transferred from bogoso prestea and contract equipment until new equipment is procured 
during we anticipate feeding the wassa plant with approximately heap leach material and open pit ore 
recoveries are expected to average between and with recoveries from heap leach material and open pit ore ranging from to and to  respectively 
during we expect to produce between  and  ounces of gold at wassa at an average cash operating cost between and per ounce 
we expect production costs to be higher than this in the first half of due to the higher costs of operating the power house 
in the second half of costs are expected to fall by to per ounce following completion of the power line and the acquisition of new mining equipment 
after production we expect annual gold production to exceed  ounces per year  at an average cash operating cost of between and per ounce 
bondaye project in addition to the biox expansion described above  we are in the process of investigating the addition of a second processing plant at bogoso prestea to process oxide  non refractory sulfide and transition ores from the southern areas of the prestea property 
in july we purchased a used  tonne per day conventional cil processing plant  associated stores inventory  and a six megawatt powerhouse from an inactive mine site in ghana 
this facility was dismantled in during and the plant was moved to prestea in where it was refurbished 
the power plant is currently being used at wassa 
with the appropriate modifications the plant should be able to process oxide  non refractory sulfide and transition ores found at prestea 
this project is referred to as the bondaye project 
we had originally planned to begin development of this new operation during  but unanticipated delays in obtaining necessary environmental permits and the impact of the 
table of contents socio economic aspects of the project have now led to a review of the optimal plant location 
we plan to continue the evaluation of the potential of this expansion option during exploration ghana we spent approximately million on exploration activities in ghana during including million at wassa establishing mineral reserves in the existing pits and in areas outside the pits  million at the prestea underground including underground care and maintenance costs  million on sulfide targets at bogoso  million on prestea area targets and approximately million on exploration projects outside the immediate wassa and bogoso prestea areas 
we plan to spend approximately million on exploration activities in ghana during to delineate additional sulfide mineralization which would be a feed source to the planned new biox plant at bogoso  to further delineate  evaluate and expand the oxide and other gold resources on the southern end of the prestea property  and to advance our understanding of the prestea underground potential 
during we expect to initiate rab drilling in the forest reserve on the southern end of the wassa property to further delineate the gold in soil geochemical anomaly discovered during the past two years 
other african projects in october we acquired a equity interest in moto goldmines limited moto for million and became moto s largest shareholder 
we received common shares and warrants  which if exercised  would raise our interest to 
at moto s annual general meeting in november  shareholders elected dr 
doug jones  golden star s vice president  exploration  as a director 
moto controls the approximate  square kilometer moto concessions located in the north east of the democratic republic of congo 
the moto concessions form part of the kilo moto gold belt which has historical production in excess of million ounces with over two million ounces mined from ten small mines within the central square kilometers on the moto concessions 
after securing control of the property in  moto began a drilling program in february to confirm and expand the gold resource around the areas previously mined 
based upon this work moto s independent resource consultants have estimated indicated resources at moto of million tonnes grading grams per tonne and inferred resources of million tonnes grading grams per tonne 
while results from the mano river project in sierra leone and the mininko project in mali were disappointing  we expect  subject to renegotiating the respective joint venture agreements  to continue funding the projects in both areas by refocusing on wide area soil sampling to identify new targets in these prospective areas 
south american projects two years of surface sampling has identified a fairly extensive gold in soil anomaly at the saramacca property in suriname 
we are planning to initiate core drilling at this project in and have budgeted million for the work program 
we spent approximately million in to expand on the surface sampling initiated in the prior year 
in we acquired the square kilometer bon espoir exploration property in french guiana for million 
bon espoir is located in french guiana north of our paul isnard property in a geological setting interpreted by us as having many similarities to the ashanti trend area of ghana 
paul isnard remained on care and maintenance in with expenditures of less than million 
an additional million of acquisition costs were incurred 
we plan to spend approximately million at bon espoir and paul isnard in conducting a wide area soil sampling programs and assessing past work 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalent balance stood at million at december   down from approximately million at the end of even though operations generated million of new cash during the year and options and warrants contributed million  spending on wassa and other capital projects including deferred exploration projects were the major factors contributing to the lower cash balance at the end of the year 
cash flow from operations totaled million in  down from million in lower gold output  higher operating costs and costs of the iamgold tender offer were the major factors contributing to the decrease 
gold sales were lower due to the difficulties experienced during the transition from oxide ores in the early part of the year to transition and non refractory sulfide ores in the latter part of the year 
the million of costs 
table of contents associated with the iamgold tender offer also contributed to the lower cash flow 
see trends and events section above for additional discussion 
investing activities consumed a net million of cash in investing activities included the following capital spending for the year ended december  in millions bogoso prestea equipment and mine property wassa property  plant equipment and development prestea underground exploration and development deferred exploration and other development projects other total stock option exercises provided million of cash during and warrant exercises provided an additional million 
new debt contributed a net million 
at december   working capital was million  versus million at the end of in june  an equipment financing credit facility was established between caterpillar financial services corporation and certain of our subsidiaries  with golden star as the guarantor of all amounts borrowed 
the facility provides up to a maximum of million of credit for a mixture of new and used mining equipment 
the facility can be renewed but expires on april   bears interest at a rate equal to the five year us swap rate plus for new equipment  is repayable over five years and requires monthly payments 
the facility can also be applied to used equipment for which the interest rate is negotiable and must be repaid monthly over two years 
as of december  the amount drawn on this facility was million 
we anticipate drawing additional amounts in as we purchase mining equipment for wassa and bogoso prestea 
in addition to the capital spending shown in the table  liquidation of debt consumed million of cash leaving million of debt on the balance sheet at year end 
shareholders equity stood at million at december   up from million at the end of december outlook we expect that bogoso prestea will continue generating positive operating cash flows in  but will require additional cash for the expansion projects described above 
it is anticipated that wassa will also generate a positive operational cash flow once in but will need additional funds in for the purchase of the mining fleet 
at december  there was million of cash and cash equivalents on hand 
we anticipate capital spending of approximately million in on the following projects amount capital spending by project millions nature of expenditures bogoso prestea mining equipment and plant sustaining capital biox upgrade bogoso plant biox conversion mampon feasibility studies  metallurgical testing prestea underground exploration drilling and mine maintenance wasssa power line construction  mining equipment  exploration and sustaining capital other deferred exploration and sustaining capital total 
table of contents if additional cash is needed in connection with the projects described above or in connection with future acquisitions  we may seek external debt or equity financing  although we may not be able to obtain the funds required on acceptable terms if at all 
in addition to the equipment financing facility  we have mandated a group of banks and are seeking debt under a revolving credit agreement 
looking ahead our main objectives in are orderly and efficient mining of prestea plant north ores to allow an adequate flow of transition and non refractory sulfide ores to the bogoso plant  commencement of commercial production at wassa in the first quarter  followed by orderly and efficient operations  completion of permitting and reassessment optimization of the bondaye project  completion of permitting  planning  engineering and design work and initiation of construction of the bogoso biox conversion project  continued evaluation of the prestea underground potential  a continued high level of exploration efforts  and continuation of efforts to identify and pursue acquisition and growth opportunities in ghana and elsewhere 
we expect gold production at bogoso prestea of approximately  to  ounces in at a projected cash operating cost of to per ounce and production of approximately  to  ounces at wassa at a cash operating cost of to per ounce bringing total production to approximately  to  ounces at an average cash operating cost of to per ounce 
as more fully disclosed in item risk factors  numerous factors could cause our estimates and expectations to be wrong or could lead changes in our plans 
under any of these circumstances  the estimates described above could change materially 
mining in ghana we regularly monitor and evaluate the social and political aspects of ghana in particular and of west africa in general to apprise ourselves of the social situation and political risks that exist in the region 
ghana has benefited from an extended period of political stability and a democratic governmental system including orderly governmental transitions via free elections 
it is our belief that ghana is committed to creating a stable political and economic environment that will foster additional economic growth 
ghana is endowed with abundant mineral resources and is actively pursuing policies designed to support expansion of its mineral industry 
because of the political stability and supportive policies  several international mineral companies have initiated exploration and mining activities in ghana in recent years and we understand that these companies now have in place plans to make significant investments in gold exploration and development 
it is our policy and our intent to be a responsible corporate citizen of ghana and as such we have worked diligently to establish good working relationships with both local and federal governmental authorities as well as with the local citizens in the areas adjacent to our operations 
we have experienced ongoing and escalating incidents of artisanal miners illegally working on our properties in ghana 
while we are sympathetic to the economic needs of those engaged in this activity  this mining is illegal and typically results in uncontrolled environmental damage and is often conducted in an unsafe manner 
in addition  failure to discourage illegal mining on our properties could jeopardize legal title to our mineral rights 
as such we have sought to stop this activity both by dialogue and by establishing a security presence 
the governmental 
table of contents authorities in western ghana are aware of the illegal mining situation and have been of assistance in our efforts to discourage such activity but more needs to be done 
seasonality most of our operations are in tropical climates which experience annual rainy seasons 
typically mining operations are not materially affected by the rainy seasons in ghana but unusually high rainfall in the late summer of impeded mine production at bogoso prestea and also interrupted underground drilling in the prestea underground 
exploration efforts in ghana and in the guiana shield in south america are generally timed to avoid the rainy periods to ease transportation logistics associated with wet roads and swollen rivers 
related party transactions during we obtained legal services from a legal firm to which our chairman is of counsel 
total value of all services purchased during was million 
our chairman did not personally perform any legal services for us during nor did he benefit directly or indirectly from payments for the services performed by the firm 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements reflect the application of cdn gaap  which is different in certain material respects from us gaap 
the accounting policies reflected therein are generally those applied by similarly situated mining companies in canada 
our accounting policies under canadian gaap are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that can affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
accounting policies relating to asset impairments  depreciation and amortization of mining property  plant and equipment  and site reclamation closure accruals are subject to estimates and assumptions regarding reserves  gold recoveries  future gold prices and future mining activities 
decisions to write off  or not to write off  all or a portion of our investment in various properties  especially exploration properties  subject to impairment analysis are based on our judgment as to the actual value of the properties and are therefore subjective in most cases 
we have written off substantially all of our pre investments in exploration properties based upon our assessments of the amounts recoverable from these properties 
additional exploration properties have been found to be impaired and were written off in and we continue to retain title to certain properties after impairment write offs as future events and discoveries may ultimately prove that they have significant value 
listed below are the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset  liability  revenue or expense being reported 
ore stockpiles stockpiles represent coarse ore that has been extracted from the mine and is available for further processing 
stockpiles are measured by estimating the number of tons added and removed from the stockpile  the number of contained ounces based on assay data  and the estimated recovery percentage based on the expected processing method 
stockpiles are valued based on mining costs incurred up to the point of stockpiling the ore including applicable depreciation  depletion and amortization relating to mining operations 
costs are added to a stockpile based on current mining costs and removed at the average cost per recoverable ounce of gold in the stockpile 
stockpiles are reduced as material is removed and fed to the mill 
a adjustment of the stockpile value  based on stockpile levels in recent periods  would change the carrying value of the stockpile inventory by approximately million and change operating costs by the same amount 
impairment charges we periodically review and evaluate our long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable from continued operation of the asset 
an asset impairment is considered to exist if the sum of all estimated future cash flows  on an undiscounted basis  are less than the carrying value of the asset 
the determination 
table of contents of expected future cash flows requires numerous estimates about the future including gold prices  operating costs  gold recovery  reclamation spending  ore reserves and capital expenditures 
a review of bogeso prestea s expected future cash flows as of december  indicated that there is no impairment at gold prices in excess of per once and at wassa there is no impairment at gold prices greater than per once 
mining properties mine properties recorded on our financial records are amortized using a units of production method over proven and probable reserves 
reserve estimates  which serve as the denominator in units of production amortization calculations  involve the exercise of subjective judgment and are based on numerous assumptions about future operating costs  future gold prices  continuity of mineralization  future gold recovery rates  spatial configuration of gold deposits  and other factors that may prove to be incorrect 
a adjustment in estimated reserves could result in an approximately million annual change in amortization expense 
asset retirement obligation and reclamation expenditures accounting for reclamation obligations requires management to make estimates at each mining operation of reclamation and closure costs to be incurred in the future as required to complete the reclamation and environmental remediation work mandated by existing laws and regulations 
actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated 
additionally  future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required 
based upon our current situation  we estimate that a increases in total future reclamation and closure costs would result in an approximately million increase in our asset retirement obligations 
recent accounting pronouncements impact of new pronouncements effective in in november  the cica amended cica stock based compensation and other stock based payments to require recognition at the date of grant  of expense for stock option grants after december  in an amount equal to the fair value of the option 
we opted for an early adoption of this new guidance and began expensing stock options during the impact of this election resulted in recognition of approximately million of stock option expense in and approximately million in in december  the cica issued accounting guideline acg  hedging relationships 
the guideline establishes requirements for the identification  documentation and effectiveness of hedging relationships  which would have been effective for fiscal years beginning on or before july  since we had no hedging instruments there was no impact on our financial results from the adoption of the guidance 
new pronouncements effective in acg consolidations of variable interest entities in november  the cica issued accounting guideline consolidation of variable interest entities acg to provide guidance for determining when an enterprise includes assets  liabilities and results of activities of variable interest entities in its consolidated financial statements 
variable interest entities are those in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
we do not anticipate any material impact on our consolidated financial statements or financial results from the adoption of acg for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements under us gaap  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents table of contractual obligations contractual obligations payments due by period thousands less more than than as of december  total year years years years long term debt interest on long term debt operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet under gaap other long term liabilities represent asset retirement obligations 
asset retirement obligations include several estimates about future reclamation costs  mining schedules  timing of the performance of reclamation work and the quantity of ore reserves which in turn determine the ultimate closure date  which in turn impacts the discounted amounts of future asset retirement liabilities 
the discounted value of these projected cash flows is recorded as asset retirement obligations on the balance sheet of million as of december  the amounts shown above are undiscounted to show full expected cash requirements 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation includes information available to februay  as of january  we had  common shares outstanding 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk includes  but is not limited to  the following risks changes in interest rates on our investment portfolio  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity price fluctuations and equity price risk 
interest rate risk we currently have minimal debt and thus no material interest rate exposure related to debt 
from time to time we invest excess cash in high quality short term debt instruments 
the rates received on such investments may fluctuate with changes in economic conditions 
as a result our investment income may fall short of expectations during periods of lower interest rates 
we estimate that given the cash balances expected during  a change in interest rates would result in a to million change in annual interest income 
we may in the future actively manage our exposure to interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk while our major operating units transact most of their business in us dollars  many purchases of labor  operating supplies and capital assets are denominated in euros  british pounds  australian dollars  south african rand and ghanaian cedis 
as a result  currency exchange fluctuations may impact the costs incurred at our operations 
gold is sold throughout the world based principally on the us dollar price  but significant portions of our operating expenses and some of our capital purchases are incurred in currenciesother than the us dollar 
the appreciation of non us dollar currencies against the us dollar increases production costs and the cost of capital assets in us dollar terms at mines located outside the us  which would adversely impact our net income and cash flows 
conversely  a depreciation of non us dollar currencies usually decreases production costs and capital asset purchases in us dollar terms 
the value of cash and cash equivalent investments denominated in foreign currencies also fluctuate with changes in currency exchange rates 
appreciation of non us dollar currencies results in a foreign currency gain on such investments and a decrease in non us dollar currencies results in a loss 
we do not currently utilize market risk sensitive instruments to manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates  although we may do so in the future 

table of contents commodity price risk we are engaged in gold mining and related activities  including exploration  extraction  processing and reclamation 
gold is our primary product and  as a result  changes in the price of gold could significantly affect our results of operations and cash flows 
according to current estimates  a change in the price of gold would result in a million to million change in pre tax earnings and cash flows during we have in the past purchased puts to lock in minimum prices for portions of our annual gold sales but we have no puts outstanding at the end of we may in the future more actively manage our exposure through hedging programs 
equity price risk we have in the past and may in the future seek to acquire additional funding by sale of common shares 
movements in the price of our common shares have been volatile in the past and may also be volatile in the future 
as a result  there is a risk that we may not be able to sell new common shares at an acceptable price should the need for new equity funding arise
