such forward looking statements include statements regarding the intent  belief or current expectations of us and our management and involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results  performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such factors include  among other things  the following o risks of investing in uninsured and non investment grade mortgage assets and subordinated cmbs  o competition in acquiring desirable investments  o interest rate fluctuations and changes in prepayment rates which may affect the value of our assets  o risks associated with investments in real estate generally and the properties which secure many of our investments  o general economic conditions  particularly as they affect the value of our assets and the credit status of our borrowers  o dependence on our external advisor for all services vital to our operations  o conflicts which may arise among us and other entities affiliated with our advisor which have similar investment policies to ours  and o risks associated with the repurchase agreements we utilize to finance our investments and the availability of financing generally readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this annual report 
factors affecting comparability in  several of our loans defaulted and we subsequently foreclosed upon and now own the properties 
in certain instances this required us to invest additional capital to acquire senior mortgage positions and subsequently foreclose on those positions to acquire the real estate securing the loans 
additionally  the sale of some of the properties did not qualify as a sale for accounting purposes and the first mortgage debt secured by the purchaser is reflected in our financial statements 
as a result of the foreclosures  we now have a significant amount of real estate owned and mortgage loans payable on our balance sheet 
this results in a reduction of certain interest income  the recognition of rental income and income from real estate owned  and the depreciation of certain of the foreclosed properties  none of which was recorded prior to the second half of see real estate owned below 
investment activity during the years ended december  and  we made the following investments in thousands december  december  weighted weighted average average amount interest rate amount interest rate fnma certificates   mezzanine loans   bridge loans notes receivable   variable rate bridge loans  libor taxable revenue bonds  mortgage loans  total   during  the composition of our investment portfolio shifted to include a larger proportion of debt securities and a smaller proportion of other debt instruments 
this change resulted from the relative availability of investment opportunities  the ability to obtain leverage on those assets to allow further investment and the timing of cash flows related to the liquidation of other assets in our portfolio 
our declaration of trust requires that of our new investments be of the type we originally invested in prior to our reorganization in generally  we seek to maintain at least of our investments in government insured or guaranteed investments 
at december   we owned approximately million in gnma and fnma certificates  representing approximately of our assets 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and the following is a summary of our operations for the year ended december  compared to in thousands year ended december  change total revenues   total expenses   total other income   net income   for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   revenues and other income have increased mainly due to an increase in acquisitions and additional fundings of gnma and fnma certificates and revenues generated by foreclosed properties 
expenses have also increased for these periods due to an increase in expenses related to the foreclosed properties  higher interest costs  general and administrative expenses and depreciation recorded for real estate owned 
revenues changes in the components of our revenue in as compared to were as follows change from prior year interest income debt securities mortgage loans notes receivable revenue bonds temporary investments rental income other revenues total revenues at december  and we had the following investments december  december  weighted weighted carrying average carrying average amount interest rate amount interest rate debt securities   mortgage loans   notes receivable   revenue bonds   interest income from debt securities increased  primarily due to the continued advances on the ellington plaza gnma certificate and the purchase of eight fnma certificates during  partially offset by the repayment of the autumn creek gnma certificate 
interest income from mortgage loans decreased  primarily due to the receipt of additional interest due upon repayment of the stonybrook ii first mortgage and mezzanine loan in  with no comparable items in  and the reduction of interest received from certain foreclosed properties due to the reclassification of these assets to real estate owned 
interest income from notes receivable decreased  primarily due to the default of required debt service payments from foreclosed properties see real estate owned below 
interest income from revenue bonds relates to taxable revenue bonds purchased in october and the increase in reflects a full year of ownership as compared to two months in rental income was recorded for the year ended december  due to the reclassification of the plaza at san jacinto property as real estate owned held and used see real estate owned below 
expenses changes in components of our expenses in as compared to were as follows change from prior year interest general and administrative fees to advisor property operations depreciation amortization and other total expenses at december   excluding mortgages on real estate owned  we had total debt of approximately million with a weighted average interest rate of per year  including the effect of a swap agreement put into place in april at december   we had a comparable balance of approximately million with a weighted average interest rate of per year 
interest expense increased  primarily due to the borrowings stemming from the increased investment base 
this increase can also be attributed to the interest rate swap agreement  which was outstanding for all of and a steady increase in libor during during  libor increased 
general and administrative expenses increased  primarily due to the increase in legal fees related to foreclosed properties  the increase in accounting fees related to sarbanes oxley consulting services  and the increase of certain other administrative costs 
property operations were recorded for the year ended december  due to the reclassification of the plaza at san jacinto as real estate owned held and used see real estate owned below 
depreciation expense was recorded for the year ended december  relating to the reclassification of foreclosed properties from real estate owned held for sale to real estate owned held and used 
depreciation was captured for the periods  as well as retroactively to the initial foreclosure dates of the properties see real estate owned below 
other income other income increased  due to the increase in net operating income recognized from the operations of foreclosed properties see real estate owned below 
real estate owned during  five loans defaulted and we foreclosed upon and took ownership of the underlying properties 
we reclassified our investments in these foreclosed properties as real estate owned held for sale on our balance sheet and recognized income from the operations of these properties 
as a result of these unusual circumstances  there was a substantial decrease in interest income from these loans  as noted above 
during the time we owned the real estate  certain circumstances have occurred that warranted the reclassification of most of these assets 
the following is the december  classification of our real estate owned portfolio o real estate owned held and used during  we reclassified one of the unsold properties as real estate owned held and used because we have not sold it within the one year time frame required by generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
as a result  we recorded depreciation on the property in  as well as retroactively for the full year that the property was classified as held for sale 
we also recognize the property s rental income and operational expenses in separate line items on the income statement 
during february  this property was sold see note to our consolidated financial statements 
during  we reclassified our real estate owned subject to sales contract properties to real estate owned held and used see below 
o real estate owned subject to sales contracts in the fourth quarter of  we sold three of the properties and provided financing to the buyer  via a bridge loan 
per the terms of that loan  we received of the properties cash flow until permanent financing was put in place in december see below 
due to our providing financing to the buyer  these transactions did not constitute a sale in accordance with gaap and  therefore  we continued to classify the properties as real estate owned subject to sales contracts on the balance sheet 
during december  ubs real estate investments  inc provided permanent first mortgage financing in the amount of million for these properties 
we restructured the remaining balance due from the borrower of approximately in the form of a mezzanine loan 
this sale still does not constitute a sale in accordance with gaap 
we have reclassified these properties on our balance sheet as real estate owned held and used  and have recorded depreciation on the properties in  as well as retroactively for the period since foreclosure 
we have recognized income associated with the properties as income from real estate owned on the income statement up to the date of refinancing 
we will recognize income associated with million mezzanine loan as rental income on future income statements 
o real estate owned held for sale one remaining property in our real estate owned portfolio  autumn creek  will continue to remain as real estate owned held for sale as we continue to market the real estate 
we have changed the marketing strategy of this asset in order to reflect marketplace behavior 
there have been circumstances that arose during that have warranted us to seek foreclosure of another property to protect our investment 
the northbrooke mezzanine loan defaulted by ceasing to make required debt service payments and we are currently in the process of determining the necessary steps for foreclosure 
we expect to fully recover our investment 
we have focused on increasing the occupancy level and operating income of all of the properties owned to projected stabilization levels 
the weighted average occupancy rate on the stabilized properties at the time of foreclosure was and the weighted average occupancy rate on these same properties at december  was 
as a result  we have experienced increasing yields on several of these foreclosed assets 
while property level operations continue to improve  we are actively seeking to sell or refinance the properties with third parties so that we can redeploy the capital invested into higher yielding investments 
other items the loss on the repayment of debt securities in related to the write off of a purchase premium upon repayment of a gnma certificate 
comparison of years ended december  and the following is a summary of our operations for the year ended december  compared to in thousands year ended december  change total revenues   total expenses   total other income   net income   for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   revenues and other income increased mainly due to increases in investment activity during  as well as the reclassification of certain foreclosed assets into real estate owned 
expenses also increased for these periods due to increased borrowing activity to fund investments  as well as higher general and administrative expenses related to the foreclosure of real estate properties 
revenues changes in components of our revenues in as compared to were as follows year ended december change from prior year interest income debt securities mortgage loans notes receivable revenue bonds temporary investments other revenues total revenues interest income from debt securities increased  primarily due to the purchase of three additional gnma certificates in the latter part of  and the purchase of fifteen fnma certificates during interest income from mortgage loans increased  primarily due to the additional interest and prepayment penalties received  as well as the recognition of deferred loan origination fees from the repayment of the stonybrook ii first mortgage and mezzanine loans in interest income from notes receivable increased  due to the initial funding of ten notes receivable during  partially offset by the default of required debt service payments from the concord at gessner  concord at little york  and concord at gulfgate notes see real estate owned above 
interest income from revenue bonds  arose from our first purchase of taxable revenue bonds in october rental income increased  primarily due to the net operating income from the operations of foreclosed properties  while we recorded no such income in expenses changes in components of our expenses in as compared to were as follows year ended december change from prior year interest general and administrative fees to advisor amortization and other total expenses interest expense increased  due to the increased borrowings on our warehouse facility and additional borrowings under the repurchase facility  which were used to fund investments  as well as the addition of an interest rate swap agreement put into place in march to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows and earnings 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings was in  compared to in the rate decrease was primarily due to a steady decrease in libor during and general and administrative increased primarily due to increased legal fees on foreclosed properties and an increase in excise taxes due to the annual distribution obligation falling below the minimum threshold 
fees to advisor increased  primarily due to an increase in asset management fees due to a higher asset base and an increase in overhead reimbursements 
these increases were partially offset by decreased incentive management fees as none were earned by the advisor in other items a loss on the repayment of debt securities in the amount of approximately  relating to the write off of a purchase premium upon repayment of one gnma certificate and a gain of approximately  for the sale of a vacant lot at concord at gessner  were recorded for the year ended december  during  the company had a gain of approximately  resulting from the sale of one gnma certificate 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo  represents net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  excluding depreciation and amortization related to real property and including funds from operations for unconsolidated joint ventures calculated on the same basis 
ffo is calculated in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
our management considers ffo a supplemental measure of operating performance  and  along with cash flows from operating activities  financing activities  and investing activities  it provides investors with an indication of our ability to incur and service debt  make capital expenditures  and to fund other cash needs 
for the years ended december  and  ffo was equal to net income  as we did not record depreciation expense on any of our assets 
the following table reconciles net income to ffo for the year ended december  in thousands year ended december  net income  add back depreciation of real property  ffo  cash flows from operating activities  investing activities  financing activities  weighted average shares outstanding basic  diluted  since not all companies calculate ffo in a similar fashion  our calculation presented above may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
liquidity and capital resources sources of funds we expect that cash generated from our investments  as well as our borrowing capacity  will meet our needs for short term liquidity and will be sufficient to pay all expenses and distributions to our shareholders in amounts sufficient to retain our reit status in the foreseeable future 
in order to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code  as amended  we must  among other things  distribute at least of our taxable income 
we believe that we are in compliance with the reit related provisions of the code 
we finance our investing activity primarily through borrowing from various facilities at short term rates 
at december   we had approximately million available to borrow  contractually  under our debt facilities without exceeding limits imposed by debt covenants and our declaration of trust 
in august  our warehouse facility will mature 
we are seeking to replace this facility with a similar one with similar terms and are currently in negotiations with financial institutions to develop such a facility 
from time to time  we may also issue common shares or other equity to fund investing activity 
in april  we completed a public offering of  common shares for net proceeds of approximately million  which were used to fund investments 
we have capacity to raise approximately million of additional funds by issuing either common or preferred shares pursuant to a shelf registration statement filed with the sec in if market conditions warrant  we may seek to raise additional funds for investment through further offerings  although the timing and amount of such offerings cannot be determined at this time 
summary of cash flows during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   the net change in cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately million 
operating cash flows improved by million primarily due to higher cash earnings and favorable variances in timing of receivables collected 
a decrease in net cash used in investing activities approximately million and a corresponding decrease in net cash provided by financing activities approximately million were due to a higher level of investing activity in debt securities  mortgage loans  and mezzanine and bridge loans during the period 
the lower level of investing in corresponded to the decrease in net borrowings 
during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   the net change in cash and cash equivalents decreased approximately million 
operating cash flows improved by approximately million primarily due to higher earnings 
an increase in net cash used in investing activities approximately million and an increase in net cash provided by financing activities approximately million were due to an increase in proceeds received from repurchase and warehouse facilities used for purchases of mortgage loans and debt securities 
other we are not aware of any trends or events  commitments or uncertainties  which have not otherwise been disclosed that will or are likely to impact liquidity in a material way 
distributions of the total distributions of approximately million and approximately million for the years ended december  and  respectively  approximately million 
per share or represented a return of capital for the year ended december  and approximately  
per share or represented a return of capital for the year ended december   determined in accordance with gaap 
as of december   the aggregate amount of the distributions made since our initial public offering representing a return of capital  in accordance with gaap  totaled approximately million 
the portion of the distributions which constituted a return of capital was more significant in our initial years in order to permit us to maintain level distributions to shareholders while we were in the process of investing the proceeds from our initial public offering 
application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of gaap  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions sometimes involve future events which cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  our determination of estimates requires that we exercise our judgment 
while we have used our best estimates based on the facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different results may actually occur and any such differences could be material to our financial statements 
we believe the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statement o valuation of investments in debt securities  o assessment of impairment of mortgage loans and notes  o classification of mezzanine loan investments  and o classification and valuation of real estate owned 
valuation of investments in debt securities sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  provides guidance on determining the valuation of investments owned 
the initial classification of our investments in the available for sale category rather than as held to maturity is due to our intent to sell these securities if the terms of a particular offer are deemed favorable to us 
we have sold these securities in the past and from time to time  we may look to sell these securities in the future if it is opportunistic for us to do so 
because of this classification  we must carry our investments at estimated fair value 
gnma and fnma dus certificates are relatively liquid investments 
we use third party quoted market prices as our primary source of valuation information 
assessment of impairment of mortgage loans and notes sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  establishes standards regarding impairment issues related to our mortgage loans and notes receivable 
our portfolio of mortgage loans and notes is periodically evaluated for impairment to establish appropriate loan loss reserves  if necessary 
our advisor has a credit review committee which meets monthly and reviews the status of each loan and note and maintains a watch list of loans including loans for which we have issued guarantees for which the underlying property may be experiencing construction cost overruns  delays in construction completion  occupancy shortfalls  lower than expected debt service coverage ratios  or other matters which might cause the borrower to be unable to make scheduled interest and principal payments 
if a loan is experiencing difficulties  members of this credit committee work with the borrower to try to resolve the issues  which could include extending the loan term  making additional advances  or reducing required payments 
if  in the judgment of our management  it is determined that it is probable that we will not receive all contractually required payments when they are due  the loan or note would be deemed impaired  and a loan loss reserve established 
as of december   our management had determined that no loan required a loss reserve 
classification of mezzanine loan investments our mezzanine loan investments bear interest at fixed or variable rates  and some also include provisions that allow us to participate in a percentage of the underlying property s cash flows from operations and proceeds from a sale or refinancing 
at the inception of each such investment  our management must determine whether such investment should be accounted for as a loan  joint venture or as real estate  using the guidance contained in the third notice to practitioners issued by the aicpa 
although the accounting methodology does not affect our cash flows from these investments  this determination affects the balance sheet classification of the investments as well as the classification  timing and amounts of reported earnings 
accounting for the investment as real estate is required if we expect that the amount of profit  regardless of its nature  is over percent of the property s total expected residual profit 
if a mezzanine investment were accounted for as an investment in real estate  our balance sheet would show the underlying property and its related senior debt if such debt were not also held by us  and the income statement would include the property s rental revenues  operating expenses and depreciation 
if we expect to receive less than percent of the property s residual profit  then loan or joint venture accounting is applied 
loan accounting is appropriate o if the borrower has a substantial equity investment in the property  o if we have recourse to substantial assets of the borrower  o if the property is generating sufficient cash flow to service normal loan amortization  or o if certain other conditions are met 
under loan accounting  we recognize interest income as earned and additional interest from participations as received 
joint venture accounting would require that we only record our share of the net income from the underlying property 
our management must exercise judgment in making the required accounting determinations 
for each mezzanine arrangement  we project total cash flows over the loan s term and our share in those cash flows  and consider the borrower s equity  the contractual cap  if any  on total yield to us over the term of the loan  market yields on comparable loans  borrower guarantees  and other factors in making an assessment of the proper accounting 
to date  we have determined that all mezzanine investments should be accounted for as loans 
classification and valuation of real estate owned the accounting for the foreclosure  ownership and subsequent sale of real estate is governed by o sfas no 
 accounting by debtors and creditors for troubled debt restructurings  o sfas no 
 accounting for the sale or disposal of long lived assets  and o sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
during  we exercised our rights under subordinated promissory notes and other documents to take possession of certain real estate collateral 
we have also purchased the first mortgage loans on all of the respective properties  except for autumn creek  and acquired the real estate at foreclosure auctions 
three of the properties were subsequently sold  although the transaction did not meet the sale criteria of sfas no 
 despite the fact that the purchaser later secured permanent first mortgage financing 
when a loan is in the process of foreclosure  it is our policy to initially reclassify the balance of the loan into real estate owned held for sale at the lower of fair value of the real estate  less estimated disposal costs or the carrying amount of the loan  and to cease accrual of interest 
we obtain independent appraisals of all foreclosed real estate to assist management in evaluating property values 
to date  no losses have been recorded upon foreclosure 
it is our intent to sell foreclosed properties within a short time period 
due to the held for sale classification  we do not initially depreciate the properties 
if we do not sell a property or do not meet sale criteria within the permissible timeframe for held for sale classification  we reclassify the property into real estate owned held and used or subject to sales contract categories and account for it as an operating asset 
depreciation is recorded for the asset including a retroactive adjustment for the full period that the property was classified as real estate owned held for sale 
income from property operations is recorded provided realization and collectibility of the amounts are considered likely 
likewise  interest income on notes receivable for properties sold that do not meet the criteria for sale recognition is recorded to the extent that collectibility is considered likely 
this accounting for real estate owned requires substantial judgment as to the fair value of the assets  the likelihood of collecting income and our ability to sell the properties 
as of december   we believe that the amounts reported are fairly stated and realizable 
commitments  contingencies and off balance sheet arrangements we have no unconsolidated subsidiaries  special purpose off balance sheet financing entities  or other off balance sheet arrangements 
the following table reflects our maximum exposure and carrying amount as of december   for guarantees we have entered into in thousands maximum carrying exposure amount stabilization loan guarantees  fnma loan program  these guarantees provide credit enhancement to developers during construction and lease up of new properties for a fee 
we issued these guarantees as a means to address an undeserved market for credit and to establish and maintain relationships with developers 
we believe there is little risk associated with the guarantees and expect no liquidity requirements in the near term 
these indemnification agreements relate to a program we initiated and have since discontinued 
we believe the risk of any cost associated with the indemnity agreement is minimal 
the maximum exposure amount is not indicative of any expected losses under the guarantees 
for full description of these guarantees  see note to the consolidated financial statements

 this statement is expected to have an immaterial impact on our financial statements 
there are no other new pending accounting pronouncements which we are required to adopt that would have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
inflation inflation did not have a material effect on our results for the periods presented 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which our investments are exposed to is interest rate risk  which is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
interest rate risk interest rate fluctuations can adversely affect our income in many ways and present a variety of risks  including the risk of mismatch between asset yields and borrowing rates 
our operating results depend in large part on differences between the income from our assets net of credit losses and our borrowing costs 
most of our assets generate fixed returns and have terms in excess of five years 
we fund the origination and acquisition of a significant portion of these assets with borrowings which have variable interest rates that reset relatively rapidly  such as monthly or quarterly 
in most cases  the income from assets will respond more slowly to interest rate fluctuations than the cost of borrowings  creating a mismatch between asset yields and borrowing rates 
consequently  changes in interest rates  particularly short term interest rates  may influence our net income 
our borrowings under repurchase and warehouse agreements bear interest at rates that fluctuate with libor 
various financial vehicles exist which would allow our management to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows and earnings 
during march  upon our management s analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies  we entered into an interest rate swap in order to hedge against increases in the floating interest rate on our repurchase facilities 
the swap is a five year agreement with bank of america whereby we pay bank of america a fixed on a notional amount of million 
in return  fleet pays us a floating rate equivalent to the day libor rate on the same notional amount 
a possible risk of such swap agreements is the possible inability of bank of america to meet the terms of the contracts with us  however  there is no current indication of such an inability 
based on the million unhedged portion of million of borrowings outstanding at december   a change in libor would impact our annual net income and cash flows by approximately million 
however  since the interest income from some of our loans is also based on libor  a increase in libor would increase our annual net income and cash flows from such loans by approximately  because the value of our debt securities fluctuate with changes in interest rates  rate fluctuations will also affect the market value of our net assets
