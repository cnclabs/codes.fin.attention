item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview at december   we had total consolidated assets of billion  total loans of billion  total deposits of billion and total shareholders equity of million 
the year saw continued solid financial performance coupled with many significant accomplishments  some of which were not necessarily reflected in our operating results 
during the past year  we completed the acquisition and successful integration of humboldt bancorp  which expanded our market footprint to include stores located throughout northern california 
this acquisition increased our asset size by approximately 
as of december   we operated stores throughout oregon  northern california and southwestern washington 
continued our track record of double digit organic that is  excluding growth from acquisitions loan and deposit growth 
for  organic loan and deposit growth was and  respectively 
maintained exceptional credit quality standards  with net charge offs of only of average loans for the ratio of non performing assets to total assets at december  was  up one basis point from year end completed the sale of our merchant bankcard portfolio  which resulted in an after tax gain of million 
we believe this transaction will result in a reduction of our risk exposure to a business line where scale is essential 
produced record brokerage revenue of million  up over the retail brokerage segment contribution to net income for was  up from  in increased our cash dividend by  to per quarter  effective in the second quarter of our board of directors plans to review the dividend payout on a quarterly basis 
opened our new data center located in gresham  oregon and new training facility the world s greatest bank university in roseburg  oregon 
successfully addressed the significant new compliance requirements of the sarbanes oxley act 
we believe that  as a result of internal efforts expended on this project  our internal control structure has never been stronger 
however  the past year was not without some challenges  including mortgage banking revenue declined by  and the net income contribution from our mortgage division fell by  mostly due to a reduction in the level of mortgage refinance activity 
during  we took steps to strengthen the mortgage division management team and also terminated wholesale channel originations 
our mortgage focus is now solely on developing profitable business through our retail store network  including unique products such as a single close construction loan that automatically converts into a permanent mortgage loan upon completion 
our net interest margin continued to compress due to historically low short term market interest rates and the structure of our balance sheet 
the fully tax equivalent net interest margin for was  down basis points from and down basis points from the prospects for margin improvement in appear to be bright  given recent increases in short term rates and the asset sensitive structure of our balance sheet 
the fully tax equivalent net interest margin for the fourth quarter of was  up basis points over the first quarter of summary of critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods 
our significant accounting policies are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  in item of this report 
not all of these critical accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
however  management believes that 
table of contents the following policies and those disclosed in the notes to consolidated financial statements could be considered critical under the sec s definition 
allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded commitments the allowance for loan losses all is established to absorb known and inherent losses attributable to loans and leases outstanding 
the reserve for unfunded commitments ruc is established to absorb inherent losses associated with our commitment to lend funds  such as with a letter or line of credit 
the adequacy of the all and ruc are monitored on a regular basis and are based on management s evaluation of numerous factors 
these factors include the quality of the current loan portfolio  the trend in the loan portfolio s risk ratings  current economic conditions  loan concentrations  loan growth rates  past due and non performing trends  evaluation of specific loss estimates for all significant problem loans  historical charge off and recovery experience  and other pertinent information 
approximately of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate  and a significant decline in real estate market values may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses 
mortgage servicing rights retained mortgage servicing rights are measured by allocating the carrying value of the loans between the assets sold and the interest retained  based on their relative fair values at the date of the sale 
the subsequent measurements are determined using a discounted cash flow model 
mortgage servicing rights assets are amortized over the expected life of the loan and are evaluated periodically for impairment 
the expected life of the loan can vary from management s estimates due to prepayments by borrowers  especially when rates fall 
prepayments in excess of management s estimates would negatively impact the recorded value of the mortgage servicing rights 
the value of the mortgage servicing rights is also dependent upon the discount rate used in the model 
management reviews this rate on an ongoing basis based on current market rates 
a significant increase in the discount rate would reduce the value of mortgage servicing rights 
goodwill and intangible assets at december   we had approximately million in goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of business combinations 
we adopted financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  in accordance with the standard  goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives are no longer being amortized but instead are periodically tested for impairment 
management performs an impairment analysis for the intangible assets with indefinite lives on a quarterly basis and determined that there was no impairment as of december  recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  a revision to the previously issued guidance on accounting for stock options and other forms of equity based compensation 
sfas no 
r requires companies to recognize in the income statement the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based forms of compensation issued to employees 
for us  this standard will become effective for the third quarter of the method of determining the grant date fair value of stock options under sfas no 
r is substantially the same at the method currently used to calculate the pro forma impact on net income and earnings per share as presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
accordingly  we do not expect the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r on earnings per share will be materially different from the current pro forma disclosure 
companies may elect one of two methods for adoption of sfas no 
r 
under the modified prospective method  any awards that are granted or modified after the date of adoption will be measured and accounted for under the provisions of sfas no 
r 
the unvested portion of previously granted awards will continue to be accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  except that the compensation expense associated with the unvested portions will be recognized in the income statement 
under the modified retrospective method  all amounts previously reported are restated to reflect the amounts in the sfas no 
pro forma disclosure 
we expect to make a decision with respect to the method of adoption during the second quarter of additional information regarding other recent accounting pronouncements is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
results of operations overview for the year ended december   net income was million  or per diluted share  an increase of on a per diluted share basis 
income from continuing operations for the year ended december   which excludes the after tax operating results from and gain on the sale of our merchant bankcard portfolio was million  or per diluted share  an increase of on a per diluted share basis 
additional information on discontinued operations is provided under the 
table of contents umpqua holdings corporation heading discontinued operations below 
the improvement in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for is principally attributable to improved net interest income  offset by a decrease in mortgage banking revenue and increased operating expenses 
we completed the acquisition of humboldt on july   and the result s of the acquired operations are only included in our financial results starting on july  net income for was million  or per diluted share  an increase of on a per diluted share basis over the improvement in diluted earnings per share for was principally due to growth in net interest income  offset by an increase in operating expenses 
we completed the acquisition of centennial on november   and the results of the acquired operations are only included in our financial results starting on november  we incur significant expenses related to the completion and integration of mergers 
accordingly  we believe that our operating results are best measured on a comparative basis excluding the impact of merger related expenses  net of tax 
we define operating income as income before merger related expenses  net of tax  and we calculate operating income per diluted share by dividing operating earnings by the same diluted share total used in determining diluted earnings per share see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
operating income and operating income per diluted share are considered non gaap financial measures 
although we believe the presentation of non gaap financial measures provides a better indication of our operating performance  readers of this report are urged to review the gaap results as presented in the financial statements and supplementary data in item below 
the following table presents a reconciliation of operating income and operating income per share to net income and net income per share for years ended december   and reconciliation of operating income to net income years ended december  in thousands  except per shae data net income merger related expenses  net of tax operating income per diluted share net income merger related expenses  net of tax operating income 
table of contents the following table presents the returns on average assets  average shareholders equity and average tangible shareholders equity for the years ended december   and for each of the years presented  the table includes the calculated ratios based on reported net income and income from continuing operations  and operating income as shown in the table above 
our return on average shareholders equity is negatively impacted as the result of capital required to support goodwill under bank regulatory guidelines 
to the extent this performance metric is used to compare our performance with other financial institutions that do not have merger related intangible assets  we believe it beneficial to also consider the return on average tangible shareholders equity 
the return on average tangible shareholders equity is calculated by dividing net income by average shareholders equity less average intangible assets 
the return on average tangible shareholders equity is considered a non gaap financial measure and should be viewed in conjunction with the return on average shareholders equity 
returns on average assets  shareholders equity and tangible shareholders equity for the years ended december  in thousands returns on average assets net income income from continuing operations operating income returns on average shareholders equity net income income from continuing operations operating income returns on average tangible shareholders equity net income income from continuing operations operating income calculation of average tangible shareholders equity average shareholders equity less average intangible assets average tangible shareholders equity discontinued operations during the fourth quarter of  we completed a strategic review of our merchant bankcard portfolio 
the review concluded that shareholder value would be maximized  on a risk adjusted basis  through a sale of the portfolio to a third party 
in december  the bank sold its merchant bankcard portfolio to a third party for million in cash  resulting in a gain on sale after selling costs and related expenses of million  or million after tax 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the operating results related to the merchant bankcard portfolio including the gain on sale have been reclassified as income from discontinued operations  net of tax  for all periods presented 
we retained no ongoing liability related to the portfolio subsequent to the sale and entered into an agreement whereby we will refer all merchant applications exclusively to the buyer for a period of seven years 
in consideration for the referrals  we will receive remuneration for each accepted application and an on going royalty based on a percentage of net revenue generated by the account as defined in the agreement 
we do not expect the referral revenue will have a material impact on our non interest income 
for the years ended december   and  we recognized revenue related to the merchant bankcard portfolio of  million and  respectively 
as a result of the sale  we will no longer have the benefit of this revenue stream 
since  for the year ended december   merchant bankcard revenue comprised only about of total non interest income  we do not expect the loss of revenue will have a material impact on our results of operations in additional information on discontinued operations is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below

additional information on income taxes is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
investment securities the composition of our investment securities portfolio reflects management s investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of interest income 
the investment securities portfolio also mitigates interest rate and credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio  while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds  a source of liquidity by pledging as collateral or through repurchase agreements and collateral for certain public funds deposits

the mortgage related securities in serial maturities in the table above include both pooled mortgage backed issues and high quality cmo structures  with an average duration of five years 
these mortgage related securities provide yield spread to us treasury or agency securities  however  the cash flows arising from them can be volatile even in the best structures due to refinancing of the underlying mortgage loans 
the structure of most of the mortgage related securities provides for minimal extension risk in the event of increased market rates 
equity securities in other investment securities in the table above at december  consisted principally of investments in two mutual funds comprised largely of mortgage related securities  although the funds may also invest in us government or agency securities  bank certificates of deposit insured by the fdic or repurchase agreements

the bank provides a wide variety of credit services to its customers  including construction loans  commercial lines of credit  secured and unsecured commercial loans  commercial real estate loans  residential mortgage loans  home equity credit lines  consumer loans and commercial leases

the bank s loan administration function is charged with monitoring asset quality  establishing credit policies and procedures and enforcing the consistent application of these policies and procedures across the bank 
the provision for loan losses charged to earnings is based upon management s judgment of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level adequate to absorb probable incurred losses 
the amount of provision charge is dependent upon many factors  including loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquencies  management s assessment of loan portfolio quality  general economic conditions that can impact the value of collateral  and other trends 
the evaluation of these factors is performed through an analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
reviews of non performing  past due loans and larger credits  designed to identify potential charges to the allowance for loan losses  as well as determine the adequacy of the allowance  are conducted on a quarterly basis 
these reviews are performed by bank staff or an independent third party  and consider such factors as the financial strength of borrowers  the value of the applicable collateral  loan loss experience  estimated loan losses  growth in the loan portfolio  prevailing economic conditions and other factors 
the process for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses was modified during in connection with the humboldt acquisition 
these modifications did not result in a material adjustment to the allowance for loans losses 
additional information regarding the methodology used in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is contained in part i of this report in the section titled lending and credit functions

prior to july   our all adequacy model did not allocate any specific component of the all to loss exposure for unfunded commitments 
also during the third quarter of  we revised our methodology the all model for determining the adequacy of the all 
this was done principally as a result of the humboldt acquisition  which increased our loan portfolio by approximately billion  or 
substantially all of the loans acquired from humboldt were to borrowers in northern california and approximately were secured by real estate  with construction development and commercial real estate representing and  respectively 
although humboldt s underwriting standards were similar to ours  differences did exist for loans acquired 
subsequent to the date the acquisition was completed  all loans were originated in accordance with the bank s underwriting guidelines  policies and procedures 
the level of actual losses  as indicated by the ratio of net charge offs to total loans  declined slightly during as compared to the two previous years 
the loss factors used in the all model were adjusted for the oregon washington and california portfolios as of september   no changes were made during the fourth quarter of we have not identified any potential problem loans that were not classified as non performing but for which known information about the borrower s financial condition caused management to have concern about the ability of the borrowers to comply with the repayment terms of the loans 
a decline in the economic conditions in our general market areas or other factors could adversely impact individual borrowers or the loan portfolio in general 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that loans will not become days or more past due  become impaired or placed on non accrual  restructured or transferred to other real estate owned in the future 

table of contents umpqua holdings corporation the following table presents a summary of activity in the reserve for unfunded commitments since being established at september  summary of reserve for unfunded commitments activity in thousands balance at september  increase charged to other expenses charge offs recoveries balance at december  we believe that the all and reserve for unfunded commitments at december  are sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio and credit commitments outstanding as of that date  respectively  based on the best information available 
this assessment  based in part on historical levels of net charge offs  loan growth  and a detailed review of the quality of the loan portfolio  involves uncertainty and judgment  therefore  the adequacy of the all cannot be determined with precision and may be subject to change in future periods 
in addition  bank regulatory authorities  as part of their periodic examination of the bank  may require additional charges to the provision for loan losses in future periods if the results of their review warrant such 
mortgage servicing rights the following table presents the key elements of our mortgage servicing rights asset as of december   and mortgage servicing rights in thousands balance  beginning of year additions for new mortgage servicing rights capitalized amortization of servicing rights impairment recovery charge balance  end of year balance of loans serviced for others msr as a percentage of serviced loans as of december   we serviced residential mortgage loans for others with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of approximately billion for which servicing assets have been recorded 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the servicing asset recorded at the time of sale is amortized over the term of  and in proportion to  net servicing revenues 
for the year ended december   total mortgage loan origination volume was million  a decrease of million  or  from this decrease is principally attributable to a lower level of refinance activity due to higher market interest rates and the termination of wholesale channel originations during the third quarter of 
table of contents our servicing portfolio is segmented for purposes of determining impairment 
to the extent the fair value for any segment is less than the carrying value  an impairment reserve is recorded

down down up up segment outstanding value value reserve value balance bp bp bp bp arm hybrid arm fixed less than fixed fixed fixed or greater total portfolio the value of mortgage servicing rights is impacted by market rates for mortgage loans 
historically low market rates  which were experienced during  can cause prepayments to increase as a result of refinancing activity 
to the extent prepayment speeds exceed those estimated at the time servicing assets are originally recorded  it is possible that certain mortgage servicing rights assets may become impaired to the extent that the fair value is less than carrying value net of any previously recorded amortization or valuation reserves 
generally  the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights will increase as market rates for mortgage loans rise and decrease if market rates fall 
a valuation reserve of  was recorded as of december  based on the estimated fair value of the servicing portfolio 
the valuation reserve is adjusted on a quarterly basis through adjustments to mortgage banking revenue 
goodwill and core deposit intangible assets at december   we had goodwill and core deposit intangibles of million and million  respectively  as compared to million and million  respectively  at year end this increase is attributed to the humboldt acquisition 
the goodwill recorded in connection with the humboldt acquisition represented the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired 
a portion of the purchase price was allocated to the value of humboldt s core deposits  which included all deposits except certificates of deposit 
the value of the core deposits was determined by a third party based on an analysis of the cost differential between the core deposits and alternative funding sources 
we amortize core deposit intangible assets on an accelerated basis over an estimated ten year life 
substantially all of the goodwill is associated with our community banking operations 
we evaluate goodwill for possible impairment on a quarterly basis and there were no impairments recorded for the years ended december   or additional information regarding our accounting for goodwill and core deposit intangible assets is included in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
deposits total deposits were billion at december   an increase of billion  or  from the prior year end 
excluding the impact of deposit liabilities assumed in connection with the humboldt acquisition billion  total deposits grew by million  or  during additional information regarding deposits is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below

advances from the federal home loan banks of san francisco and seattle fhlb amounted to million of the total and are secured by investment securities and residential mortgage loans 
the fhlb advances outstanding at december  had fixed interest rates ranging from to 
approximately million  or  of the fhlb advances mature prior to december   and million  or  mature prior to december  management expects continued use of fhlb advances as a source of short and long term funding 
additional information regarding term debt is provided in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
junior subordinated debentures we had junior subordinated debentures with carrying values of million and million  respectively  at december  and the increase in outstanding junior subordinated debentures during is attributable to the humboldt acquisition and the assumption of obligations of five special purpose trust subsidiaries of humboldt 
in connection with the purchase accounting for the acquisition  the carrying value of humboldt s million of outstanding junior subordinated debentures was adjusted to yield an interest cost at then current market rates 
as a result  the issued amount of debentures was increased by recording a premium of million that is being amortized over the contractual lives of each issuance 
at december   approximately million  or of the total issued amount  had interest rates that are adjustable on a quarterly basis based on a spread over libor 
increases in short term market interest rates during have resulted in increased interest expense for junior subordinated debentures 
although any additional increases in short term market interest rates will increase the interest expense for junior subordinated debentures  we believe that other attributes of our balance sheet will serve to mitigate the impact to net interest income on a consolidated basis 
as of december   million representing the entire issued amount of junior subordinated debentures qualified as tier capital under regulatory capital purposes 
additional information regarding the terms of the junior subordinated debentures  including maturity call dates and interest rates  is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
liquidity and cash flow the principal objective of our liquidity management program is to maintain the bank s ability to meet the day to day cash flow requirements of its customers who either wish to withdraw funds or to draw upon credit facilities to meet their cash needs 
we monitor the sources and uses of funds on a daily basis to maintain an acceptable liquidity position 
in addition to liquidity from core deposits and the repayments and maturities of loans and investment securities  the bank can utilize established uncommitted federal funds lines of credit  sell securities under agreements to repurchase  borrow on a secured basis from the fhlb or issue brokered certificates of deposit 
umpqua is a separate entity from the bank and must provide for its own liquidity 
substantially all of umpqua s revenues are obtained from dividends declared and paid by the bank 
there are statutory and regulatory provisions that could limit the ability of the bank to pay dividends to umpqua 
we believe that such restrictions will not have an adverse impact on the ability of umpqua to meet its ongoing cash obligations  which consist principally of debt service of approximately million annually on the million issued amount of outstanding junior subordinated debentures 
as of december   umpqua did not have any borrowing arrangements 
as disclosed in the consolidated statements of cash flows in item of this report  net cash provided by operating activities was million during the principal source of cash provided by operating activities was net income 
net cash of million used in investing activities consisted principally of million of net loan growth offset by net cash acquired in 
table of contents connection with the humboldt acquisition of million 
the million of cash provided in financing activities primarily consisted of million of net deposit growth and million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options  offset by million of financing outflows related to stock repurchases and dividend payments 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses that may require payment of a fee by the customer 
since many of the commitments will expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily reflect future cash requirements 
at december   commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit were approximately million and million  respectively 
the following table presents a summary of significant contractual obligations extending beyond one year from december  future contractual obligations less than to thru more than in thousands year years years years total term debt junior subordinated debentures operating leases other long term liabilities total contractual obligations the table above does not include deposit liabilities or interest payments or purchase accounting adjustments related to term debt or junior subordinated debentures 
although we expect the bank s and umpqua s liquidity positions to remain satisfactory during  increases in market interest rates during the second half of have resulted in increased competition for bank deposits 
it is possible that our deposit growth for may not be maintained at previous levels due to increased pricing pressure or  in order to generate deposit growth  our pricing may need to be adjusted in manner that results in increased interest expense on deposits 
capital resources shareholders equity at december  was million  an increase of million  or  from december  the increase in shareholders equity during was principally due to the issuance of shares valued at million in connection with the humboldt acquisition  the exercise and related tax benefit of million of stock options and the retention of million  or approximately  of net income for the year  partially offset by million of common stock repurchases

the federal reserve board has in place guidelines for risk based capital requirements applicable to us banks and bank financial holding companies 
these risk based capital guidelines take into consideration risk factors  as defined by regulation  associated with various categories of assets  both on and off balance sheet 
under the guidelines  capital strength is measured in two tiers  which are used in conjunction with risk adjusted assets to determine the risk based capital ratios 
the guidelines require an total risk based capital ratio  of which must be tier i capital

the total of tier i capital plus tier ii capital components is referred to as total risk based capital  and was million at december  the percentage ratios  as calculated under the guidelines  were and for tier i and total risk based capital  respectively  at december  a minimum leverage ratio is required in addition to the risk based capital standards and is defined as period end shareholders equity and qualifying trust preferred securities  less other comprehensive income  goodwill and deposit based intangibles  divided by average assets as adjusted for goodwill and other intangible assets 
although a minimum leverage ratio of is required for the highest rated financial holding companies that are not undertaking significant expansion programs  the federal reserve board may require a financial holding company to maintain a leverage ratio greater than if it is experiencing or anticipating significant growth or is operating with less than well diversified risks in the opinion of the federal reserve board 
the federal reserve board uses the leverage and risk based capital ratios to assess capital adequacy

our consolidated leverage ratios at december  and were  and  respectively 
at december   all three of the capital ratios of the bank exceeded the minimum ratios required by federal regulation 
management monitors these ratios on a regular basis to ensure that the bank remains within regulatory guidelines 
further information regarding the actual and required capital ratios is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
our cash dividend per share was increased by  to per quarter  effective with the declaration in june this increase was approved by the board of directors in connection with its annual review of our capital plan and in consideration of the growth in net income per share 
the payment of cash dividends is subject to regulatory limitations as described under the supervision and regulation section of part i of this report 
there is no assurance that future cash dividends will be declared or increased 
the following table presents cash dividends declared and dividend payout ratios dividends declared per share divided by basic earnings per share for the years ended december   and cash dividends and payout ratios dividend declared per share dividend payout ratio our board of directors has approved a stock repurchase plan for up to million shares of common stock 
as of december   a total of million shares remain available for repurchase under this authorization  which expires on june  in addition  our stock option plans provide for option holders to pay for the exercise price in part or whole by tendering previously held shares 
although no shares were repurchased in open market transactions during the third or fourth quarters of  we do expect to repurchase additional shares in the future 
the timing and amount of such repurchases will depend upon the market price for our common stock  securities laws restricting repurchases  asset growth  earnings and our capital plan

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the absolute level and volatility of interest rates can have a significant impact on our profitability 
the objective of interest rate risk management is to identify and manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changing interest rates to achieve our overall financial objectives 
based on economic conditions  asset quality and various other considerations  management establishes tolerance ranges for interest rate sensitivity and manages within these ranges 
net interest income and the fair value of financial instruments are greatly influenced by changes in the level of interest rates 
we manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies that are established by the asset liability management committee alco 
the alco meets monthly and has responsibility for developing asset liability management policy  formulating and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and earnings and reviewing interest rate sensitivity 
the board of directors loan and investment committee provides oversight of the asset liability management process  reviews the results of the interest rate risk analyses prepared for the alco and approves the asset liability policy on an annual basis 
management utilizes an interest rate simulation model to estimate the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
such estimates are based upon a number of assumptions for each scenario  including the level of balance sheet growth  deposit repricing characteristics and the rate of prepayments 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
these repricing characteristics are the time frames within which the interest bearing assets and liabilities are subject to change in interest rates either at replacement  repricing or maturity during the life of the instruments 
interest rate sensitivity management focuses on the maturity structure of assets and liabilities and their repricing characteristics during periods of changes in market interest rates 
effective interest rate sensitivity management seeks to ensure that both assets and liabilities respond to changes in interest rates within an acceptable timeframe  thereby minimizing the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
interest rate sensitivity is measured as the difference between the volumes of assets and liabilities at a point in time that are subject to repricing at various time horizons immediate to three months  four to twelve months  one to five years  over five years  and on a cumulative basis 
the differences are known as interest sensitivity gaps 
the table below sets forth interest sensitivity gaps for these different intervals as of december  
table of contents interest sensitivity gap by repricing interval december  non rate in thousands months months years over years sensitive total assets temporary investments securities available for sale securities held to maturity trading account assets loans and loans held for sale non interest earning assets total assets liabilities and shareholders equity interest bearing demand deposits savings deposits time deposits securities sold under agreements to repurchase federal funds purchased term debt non interest bearing liabilities and shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative gap as a of earning assets changes in the mix of earning assets or supporting liabilities can either increase or decrease the net interest margin without affecting interest rate sensitivity 
in addition  the interest rate spread between an asset and its supporting liability can vary significantly  while the timing of repricing for both the asset and the liability remains the same  thus impacting net interest income 
this characteristic is referred to as basis risk and generally relates to the possibility that the repricing characteristics of short term assets tied to the prime rate are different from those of short term funding sources such as certificates of deposit 
varying interest rate environments can create unexpected changes in prepayment levels of assets and liabilities that are not reflected in the interest rate sensitivity analysis 
these prepayments may have a significant impact on our net interest margin 
because of these factors  an interest sensitivity gap analysis may not provide an accurate assessment of our exposure to changes in interest rates 
we utilize an interest rate simulation model to monitor and evaluate the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income 
the estimated impact on our net interest income over a time horizon of one year as of december  is indicated in the table below 
for the scenarios shown  the interest rate simulation assumes a parallel and sustained shift in market interest rates ratably over a twelve month period and no change in the composition or size of the balance sheet 
for example  the up basis points scenario is based on a theoretical increase in market rates of basis points per month for twelve months

it should be noted that some of the assumptions made in the simulation model may not materialize and unanticipated events and circumstances will occur 
in addition  the simulation model does not take into account any future actions which we could undertake to mitigate an adverse impact due to changes in interest rates from those expected or in the actual level of market interest rates 
a second interest rate sensitivity measure we utilize is the quantification of market value changes for all financial assets and liabilities  given an increase or decrease in market interest rates 
this approach provides a longer term view of interest rate risk  capturing all future expected cash flows 
assets and liabilities with option characteristics are measured based on different interest rate path valuations using statistical rate simulation techniques 
the table below illustrates the effects of various market interest rate changes  or shocks  on the fair values of financial assets and liabilities excluding mortgage servicing rights as compared to the corresponding carrying values and fair values as of december  interest rate simulation impact on fair value of financial assets and liabilities in thousands increase decrease in estimated percentage scenario economic value of equity change up basis points up basis points down basis points down basis points impact of inflation and changing prices a financial institution s asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of an industrial firm in that primarily all assets and liabilities of a bank are monetary in nature  with relatively little investment in fixed assets or inventories 
inflation has an important impact on the growth of total assets and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain appropriate capital ratios 
we believe that the impact of inflation on financial results depends on management s ability to react to changes in interest rates and  by such reaction  reduce the inflationary impact on performance 
we have an asset liability management program which attempts to manage interest rate sensitivity 
in addition  periodic reviews of banking services and products are conducted to adjust pricing in view of current and expected costs 
our financial statements included in item below have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which requires us to measure financial position and operating results principally in terms of historic dollars 
changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered 
the primary effect of inflation on our results of operations is through increased operating costs  such as compensation  utilities and travel expenses 
in management s opinion  changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the rate of inflation 
although interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate  they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including us fiscal and monetary policy and general national and global economic conditions
