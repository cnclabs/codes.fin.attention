item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
you should read this section in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 
critical accounting policies the accompanying consolidated financial statements and supplementary information were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
significant accounting policies are discussed in footnote to the consolidated financial statements  item inherent in the application of many of these accounting policies is the need for management to make estimates and judgments in the determination of certain revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
as such  materially different financial results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 
the policies with the greatest potential effect on our results of operation and financial position include the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable 
if there were a deterioration of a major customer s creditworthiness  or actual defaults were higher than our historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated  which could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
in addition  our revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions and royalties 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenues  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets and goodwill at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 

table of contents when we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
net long lived assets  including goodwill  amounted to million as of december  recent developments on june   we purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of play along  inc  play along hong kong limited and pa distribution  inc collectively play along 
the total purchase price of approximately million consisted of cash in the amount of million   shares of our common stock at a value of million and the assumption of certain liabilities and resulted in goodwill of million 
in addition  we agreed to pay an earn out of up to million per year for the four calendar years following the acquisition up to an aggregate amount of million based on the achievement of certain financial performance criteria which will be recorded as goodwill when and if earned 
our results of operations have included play along from the date of acquisition

on march   our consolidated financial statements as of december  and and for the two years in the period ended december  were restated from those originally issued to reflect certain adjustments related to the accounting for the acquisitions of toymax  trendmasters and p m in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
specifically  the purchase price of these acquisitions was originally allocated substantially to goodwill  and  based on studies and valuations completed in by a third party valuation consultant  the purchase price of these acquisitions was reallocated in part to intangible assets other than goodwill  including those with limited lives 
the resulting adjustment to amortization expense related to the limited life intangible assets of million in and million in and the resulting charge to cost of sales related to the mark up of acquired inventory of million in and million in  which led to a reduction of operating income in and these adjustments impacted the consolidated balance sheets as of december  and  and the consolidated statements of operations  other comprehensive income  stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the two years ended december  and results of operation the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain statement of operations data as a percentage of net sales 
years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses acquisition shut down and product recall costs income from operations profit from joint venture interest  net income before income taxes and minority interest provision for income taxes income before minority interest minority interest net income comparisons of the years ended december  and net sales 
net sales were million in compared to million in  representing an increase of 
this increase in net sales was primarily due to the addition of million in sales of traditional toys from our recent play along acquisition  as well as the addition of i million in sales of some of our other traditional toy products  including primarily tv games with titles in release in  as compared to titles in release in and wwe action figures and accessories  and ii million in international sales including million by play along 
the increase in net sales was offset in part by decreases in sales of 
table of contents our crafts and activities and writing instruments of million and our seasonal products  including water guns and junior sports toys  of million 
with the addition of play along  in addition to our other initiatives  we believe that the increased level of net sales should continue into see forward looking information 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million  or of net sales  in from million  or of net sales  in the overall increase in gross profit was attributable to the significant increase in net sales 
the decrease in gross profit margin of of net sales was primarily due to an increase in royalty expense as a percentage of net sales due to changes in the product mix to more products with higher royalty rates from products with lower royalty rates or proprietary products with no royalties 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in and million in  constituting and of net sales  respectively 
the overall increase of million in such costs was primarily due to the impact of stock based compensation million  an increase in legal fees and settlements million and bonus expense million  an increase in amortization expense related to intangible assets other than goodwill acquired in the play along acquisition and the addition of overhead related to the operations of play along million 
due to the increases in our grants of restricted stock awards and the price of our common stock in  compared to a moderate increase in the price of our common stock in  we had stock based compensation charges of million compared to million in the increase in direct selling expenses million is primarily due to an increase in advertising and promotional expenses in in support of the sell through of our various products at retail 
we produced and aired television commercials in support of several of our products  including world wrestling entertainment  dragon ball and mucha lucha action figures  tv games  care bears  cabbage patch kids and flying colors products in  and world wrestling entertainment and dragon ball action figures and flying colors products in from time to time  we may increase our advertising efforts  if we deem it appropriate for particular products 
product recall costs there were no product recall costs in in the second quarter of  we accrued a million charge for the recall of one of our products  and in the third quarter of  we recorded a credit of million for the recovery of recall costs from one of our third party factories 
the remaining component of the product recall costs is as follows in thousands accrued balance accrued balance december  accrual actual december  product recall costs profit from joint venture 
profit from joint venture increased by million in due to the joint venture having lower unit sales at lower wholesale prices of its two vehicle combat games of the five games released in compared to releasing all new titles with higher unit sales at higher wholesale prices in addition to having higher sales of carryover titles in new releases typically generate higher unit sales resulting in higher overall sales as compared to carryover titles 
profit from the joint venture contributed significantly to our pre tax profit  representing of pre tax income in and in we expect to continue to receive a preferred return over the remaining term of the license agreement ending december   although we cannot predict with certainty what levels of return will be achieved and  in any case  we anticipate substantial fluctuations in the amount of the preferred return distributed to us from year to year 

table of contents interest net 
interest income increased due to higher average cash balances during than in  but was offset by interest expense of million related to the convertible notes issued in june provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes included federal  state and foreign income taxes in and  at an effective tax rate of and  respectively  benefiting from a flat hong kong corporation tax on our income arising in  or derived from  hong kong for and for  the effective rate increased as a result of the recognition of us taxes on a greater proportion of foreign earnings deemed to be subject to us taxes 
as of december   we had net deferred tax assets of approximately million 
in making this determination  management believes it considered all available evidence  both positive and negative  as well as the weight and importance given to such evidence 
comparisons of the years ended december  and net sales 
net sales were million in compared to million in  representing an increase of 
the increase in net sales of million by our seasonal products  including trendmasters  go fly a kite  funnoodle and sports toys  and new product introductions  including dragon ball and nascar action toys  tv games and colorworkshop craft products  were offset by a decrease of million in sales of our other traditional products  and million in international sales  which included a reduction in sales of our karaoke machines and equalizer radio control vehicle in  both higher priced items 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased million  or  to million  or of net sales  in from million  or of net sales  in the overall decrease in gross profit was attributable to a decrease in gross profit margin 
the decrease in gross profit margin of of net sales was due to higher sales of seasonal products with lower margins and an increase in royalty expense as a percentage of net sales due to changes in the product mix resulting from the sale of more products with higher royalty rates  though offset in part by a decrease in amortization expense of molds and tools used in the manufacture of our products 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in and million in  constituting and of net sales  respectively 
the overall increase of million in such costs was primarily due to a charge for the grant of restricted stock of million  a charge of million to bad debt relating to the bankruptcy of several of our customers  including kay bee toys  and an increase in direct selling expenses  product development costs  option compensation expense resulting from the price reset of options in and operating expenses incurred in connection with the p m asset acquisition

there were no such costs in operations impacted by these shut downs were sales  design  distribution  and administration 
the integrations of toymax and kidz biz were completed in in  we accrued a net amount of million for the recall of one of our products  compared to having accrued million in for the recall of the same product

r interpretation r 
interpretations and r require companies with a variable interest in a variable interest entity to apply the guidance contained in such interpretations as of the beginning of the first reporting period after december  if applicable  the application of the guidance could result in the consolidation of a variable interest entity

 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
sfas establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the provisions of sfas were adopted effective june  the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we use the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options granted to employees 
as required by our existing stock plans  stock options are granted at  or above  the fair market value of our stock  and  accordingly  no compensation expense is recognized for these grants in the consolidated statement of operations 
we record compensation expense related to other stock based awards  such as restricted stock grants  over the period the award vests 
on december   the fasb issued sfas revised  share based payment sfas r  which amends sfas  accounting for stock based compensation and sfas statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires companies to measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in its consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the adoption of sfas r requires additional accounting and disclosure related to the income tax and cash flow effects resulting from share based payment arrangements 
sfas r is effective for us as of july  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have an impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position

we will pay cash interest on the notes at an annual rate of of the principal amount at issuance  from the issue date to june   payable on june and december of each year  commencing on december  after june   we will not pay cash interest on the notes 
at maturity  on june   we will redeem the notes at their accreted principal amount  which will be equal to  per  principal amount at issuance 
we may redeem the notes at our option in whole or in part beginning on june   at of their accreted principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest including contingent interest and additional amounts  if any  payable in cash 
holders of the notes may also require us to repurchase all or part of their notes on june   for cash  at a repurchase price of of the principal amount per note plus accrued and unpaid interest including contingent interest and additional amounts  if any 
holders of the notes may also require us to repurchase all or part of their notes on june  and june  at a repurchase price of of the accreted principal amount per note plus accrued and unpaid interest including contingent interest and additional amounts  if any 
any repurchases at june  and june  may be paid in cash  in shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock 
we believe that our cash flows from operations  cash and cash equivalents on hand and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements and provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our anticipated operating needs for at least the next months 
although operating activities are expected to provide cash  to the extent we grow significantly in the future  our operating and investing activities may use cash and  consequently  this growth may require us to obtain additional sources of financing 
there can be no assurance that any necessary additional financing will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
we intend to finance our long term liquidity requirements out of net cash provided by operations  marketable securities and cash on hand 
exchange rates sales from our united states and hong kong operations are denominated in us dollars and our manufacturing costs are denominated in either us or hong kong dollars 
domestic sales from our united kingdom operations and operating expenses of all of our operations are denominated in local currency  thereby creating exposure to changes in exchange rates 
changes in the hong kong dollar or british pound us dollar exchange rate may positively or negatively affect our gross margins  operating income and retained earnings 
the exchange rate of the hong kong dollar to the 
table of contents us dollar has been fixed by the hong kong government since at hk to us and  accordingly  has not represented a currency exchange risk to the us dollar 
we cannot assure you that the exchange rate between the united states and hong kong currencies will continue to be fixed or that exchange rate fluctuations between the united states and hong kong and united kingdom currencies will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states and international borrowing rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  we are exposed to market risk in certain geographic areas that have experienced or remain vulnerable to an economic downturn  such as china 
we purchase substantially all of our inventory from companies in china  and  therefore  we are subject to the risk that such suppliers will be unable to provide inventory at competitive prices 
while we believe that  if such an event were to occur we would be able to find alternative sources of inventory at competitive prices  we cannot assure you that we would be able to do so 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
historically and as of december   we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities to minimize our market risk 
interest rate risk in june  we issued convertible senior notes payable of million with a fixed interest rate of per annum 
these notes payable were outstanding as of december  accordingly  we are not generally subject to any direct risk of loss arising from changes in interest rates 
foreign currency risk we have wholly owned subsidiaries in hong kong and in the united kingdom 
sales by these operations made on a fob china or hong kong basis are denominated in us dollars 
however  purchases of inventory and hong kong operating expenses are typically denominated in hong kong dollars and domestic sales and operating expenses made in the united kingdom are typically denominated in british pounds  thereby creating exposure to changes in exchange rates 
changes in the british pound or hong kong dollar us dollar exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our gross margins  operating income and retained earnings 
the british pound gave rise to the other comprehensive loss in the balance sheet at december  the exchange rate of the hong kong dollar to the us dollar has been fixed by the hong kong government since at hk to us and  accordingly  has not represented a currency exchange risk to the us dollar 
we do not believe that near term changes in these exchange rates  if any  will result in a material effect on our future earnings  fair values or cash flows  and therefore  we have chosen not to enter into foreign currency hedging transactions 
we cannot assure you that this approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden change in the value of the hong kong dollar or british pound
