our operating income margin has grown from for the year ended april  to in fiscal on a stand alone basis excluding weightwatchers 
com  wwi s operating income margin was 
the increases are principally a result of increased naco classroom attendance 
as a result of our decision to re focus our meetings exclusively on our group education approach and to introduce into naco our points based program developed in the united kingdom and to opportunistically acquire our franchises  our naco classroom attendance  including the impact of our acquisitions  grew between april and fiscal at a compound annual rate of 
including acquisitions of our franchises that were made over this period ww group and weighco and those in fort worth  washington  dc  dallas  new mexico  north jersey  san diego and eastern north carolina  our attendance grew from million in april to million in accelerated growth in continental europe 
in continental europe  we have accelerated growth by adapting our business model to local conditions  implementing more aggressive marketing programs tailored to the local markets and increasing the number of meetings ahead of anticipated demand 
between april and fiscal  attendance in our continental european operations grew at a compound annual rate of increased product sales 
we have increased our product sales by from april to fiscal as a result of our growing attendance and introducing new products 
in our meetings  we have increased average product sales per attendance from to over the same period

accordingly  their results of operations have been included in our consolidated operating results since the dates of the completion of their respective acquisitions 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to inventories  the impairment analysis for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the bases for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most significant judgments 
revenue recognition we earn revenue by conducting meetings  selling products and aids in our meetings and to our franchisees  collecting commissions from franchisees operating under the weight watchers name  collecting royalties related to licensing agreements and selling advertising space in and copies of our magazine 
we charge non refundable registration fees in exchange for an introductory information session and materials we provide to new members 
revenue from these registration fees is recognized when the service and products are provided  which is generally at the same time payment is received from the customer 
revenue from meeting fees  product sales  commissions and royalties is recognized when services are rendered  products are shipped to customers and title and risk of loss pass to the customer  and commissions and royalties are earned 
advertising revenue is recognized when ads are published 
revenue from magazine sales is recognized when the magazine is sent to the customer 
deferred revenue  consisting of prepaid lecture and magazine subscription revenue  is amortized into income over the period earned 
discounts to customers  including free registration offers  are recorded as a deduction from gross revenue in the period such revenue was recognized 
weightwatchers 
com generates revenue from monthly subscriptions to its web site 
subscription fee revenues are recognized over the period that products are provided 
one time sign up fees are deferred and recognized over the expected customer relationship period 
subscription fee revenues that are paid in advance are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the subscription period 
we grant refunds under limited circumstances and at aggregate amounts that historically have not been material 
because the period of payment generally approximates the period revenue was originally recognized  refunds are recorded as a reduction of revenue when paid 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets finite lived intangible assets are being amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives of three to years 
effective december   we adopted sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result  we no longer amortize goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  but instead  review these assets for potential impairment on at least an annual basis 
we performed fair value impairment testing as of january  and january  on our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets and determined that the carrying amounts of these assets did not exceed their respective fair values and therefore  no impairment existed 
when determining fair value  we utilize various assumptions  including projections of future cash flows 
a change in these underlying assumptions will cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause fair value to be less than the carrying amounts 
upon such an event  we would be required to record a corresponding charge  which would impact earnings 
we continue to evaluate these estimates and assumptions and believe that these assumptions  which included an estimate of future cash flows based upon the anticipated performance of the underlying business units  were appropriate 
hedging instruments we enter into forward and swap contracts to hedge transactions denominated in foreign currencies in order to reduce currency risk associated with fluctuating exchange rates 
these contracts have been used primarily to hedge payments arising from some of our foreign currency denominated obligations 
in addition  we enter into interest rate swaps to hedge a substantial portion of our variable rate debt 
we account for our hedging instruments under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires that all derivative financial instruments be recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value as either assets or liabilities 
fair value adjustments for qualifying derivative instruments are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and will be included in earnings in the periods in which earnings are affected by the hedged item 
fair value adjustments for non qualifying derivative instruments are recorded in our results of operations 
consolidation under fin r on january   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  to clarify when an entity should consolidate another entity known as a variable interest entity vie 
the standard required that  under certain circumstances  separate businesses with some common ownership be consolidated for financial reporting purposes 
upon adoption of the original fin  we did not meet those circumstances  and we therefore did not consolidate weightwatchers 
com s financial statements into our and prior reported financial statements 
on december   the fasb issued fin r  which replaced fin fin r is applicable for financial statements issued for reporting periods after march  fin r requires that an entity consolidate a vie if that enterprise has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses  will receive a majority of the vie s expected residual returns  or both 
based on the revisions in fin r  we were required to reevaluate our relationship with our affiliate and licensee  weightwatchers 
com 
in the course of this reevaluation  we determined that weightwatchers 
com was a variable interest entity under fin r and that we were its primary beneficiary under this regulation 
effective april   we consolidated weightwatchers 
com 
in accordance with the provisions of fin r  we recorded a charge of million  including a tax charge of million  in the fiscal quarter ended april  for the cumulative effect of this accounting change 
this charge reflects the cumulative impact to our results of operations had weightwatchers 
com been consolidated since its inception in september beginning in our first fiscal quarter ended april   our consolidated balance sheet includes the balance sheet of weightwatchers 
com 
effective at the beginning of the second fiscal quarter of  our consolidated statement of operations and statement of cash flows include the results of weightwatchers 
com 
all intercompany balances have been eliminated in consolidation 
income taxes deferred income taxes result primarily from temporary differences between financial and tax reporting 
if it is more likely than not that some portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized  a valuation allowance is recognized 
we consider historic levels of income  estimates of future taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a tax valuation allowance 
we also establish an appropriate level of additional provisions for income taxes in the event that certain positions  which we believe are fully supportable  are challenged by the tax authorities 
we adjust these additional provisions in light of changing facts and circumstances 
if our filing positions are ultimately upheld under audits by respective taxing authorities  the provision for income taxes in future years will reflect favorable adjustments 
results of operations figures are rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand  percentage changes are based on rounded figures 
attendance percentage changes are based on rounded figures to the nearest thousand

accordingly  our reported results are not fully comparable for the two years 
net revenues were million for the fiscal year ended january   an increase of million  or  from million for the fiscal year ended january  the increase in net revenues was driven by international attendance growth and more favorable foreign currency rates  partially offset by a decline in north america attendance

the organic attendance comparison excludes the additional week in the fiscal year and any franchises that were acquired during either year 
we acquired four franchises since the beginning of the ww group at the beginning of the second quarter  dallas and new mexico during the fourth quarter  the washington dc area during the second quarter and fort worth during the third quarter the low carb diet fad  which escalated over the course of the fiscal year  and was extended during by food manufacturers heavily marketed introductions of related food products  has had an impact on our north america business 
we believe that the appeal of these low carb diets has peaked and the phenomenon is now in decline 
the introduction of our turnaround program has contributed to the improving attendance trends we are seeing 
the declines in organic attendances versus prior year periods improved from minus in the second quarter to minus in the third quarter and minus in the fourth quarter 
international company owned classroom meeting fees were million for the year ended january   an increase of million  or  from million for the year ended january  the growth in meeting fees was primarily driven by attendance increases in continental europe of coupled with the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates

cost of revenues was million for the year ended january   an increase of million  or  from million for the year ended january  for the year ended january   the gross profit margin of remained above the level  but was lower than the level of the prior year 
we made the strategic decision to keep the vast majority of our naco meetings open  despite the negative impact on our gross margin resulting from lower attendances per meeting  due to our expectation of the decline in the low carb phenomenon 
it is our belief that this expectation is proving to be correct 
marketing expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million in the year ended january   with the majority of the increase resulting from currency translation 
as a percentage of net revenue  marketing expenses were for the year  as compared to in the prior year period  driven by the softness in revenues

com  a million decrease in inventory resulting from our efforts to more efficiently manage inventory levels  the million decrease in cash  partially offset by the million reduction in the current portion of our long term debt resulting from the repurchase and retirement of our remaining senior subordinated notes 
capital spending has averaged approximately million annually over the last three years and has consisted primarily of leasehold improvements  furniture and equipment for meeting locations and information system expenditures 
long term debt our credit facility as defined in note to the consolidated financial statements  as amended  consists of term loans and a revolving line of credit the revolver 
our total debt outstanding was similar year over year at million and million at january  and january   respectively 
in january  we refinanced our credit facility  moving a large portion of our fixed term loans to the revolver 
this has provided us with a greater degree of flexibility and the ability to more efficiently manage cash 
under this refinancing  our term loans were reduced from million to million and our revolver capacity was increased from million to million 
to complete the refinancing  we drew down million of the revolver 
in october  we increased our net borrowing capacity by adding an additional term loan to our existing credit facility in the amount of million  coterminous with the previously existing credit facility 
these funds were initially used to reduce borrowings under our revolver  resulting in no increase to our net borrowing 
additionally  in october  we repurchased and retired the remaining balance of our senior subordinated notes 
in connection with the refinancing and retirement of debt described above  we incurred expenses of approximately million in the year ended january  at january   our debt consisted entirely of variable rate instruments

our credit facility contains customary covenants  including covenants that in certain circumstances restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends on and redeem capital stock  make other restricted payments  including investments  sell our assets and enter into consolidations  mergers and transfers of all or substantially all of our assets 
our credit facility also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests 
the credit facility contains customary events of default 
upon occurrence of an event of default under the credit facility  the lenders may cease making loans and declare amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
on january   standard poor s confirmed its bb rating for our corporate credit and our credit facility 
on march   moody s assigned a ba rating for our term loan b and additional term loan b and confirmed its ba rating for the credit facility 
contractual obligations we are obligated under non cancelable operating leases primarily for office and rent facilities 
consolidated rent expense charged to operations under all our leases for the fiscal year ended january  was approximately million 
the impact that our contractual obligations as of january  are expected to have on our consolidated liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows payment due by period total less than year years years more than years in millions long term debt operating leases total due to the fact that all of our debt is variable rate based and that a significant portion of our debt is under a revolving line of credit  the amount of future interest payments could not be reasonably estimated and is therefore not included in the amounts shown

recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
r  share based payment fas r  which replaces fas  accounting for stock based compensation and supercedes accounting principles board opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees 
fas r eliminates the option of using the intrinsic value method to record compensation expense related to stock based awards to employees and instead requires companies to recognize the cost of such awards based on their grant date fair value over the related service period of such awards 
we will adopt the provisions of this standard beginning in the third quarter of fiscal we have elected to apply the modified prospective transition method to all past awards outstanding and unvested as of the date of adoption and will recognize the associated expense over the remaining vesting period based on the fair values previously determined and disclosed as part of our pro forma disclosures 
we will not restate the results of prior periods 
prior to the effective date of fas r  we will continue to provide the pro forma disclosures for past award grants as required under fas we believe the pro forma disclosures in note to our consolidated financial statements provide an appropriate short term indicator of the level of expense that will be recognized in accordance with fas r 
however  the total expense recorded in future periods will depend on several variables  including the number of share based payment awards that are granted in future periods and the fair value of those awards 
the american jobs creation act of the ajca was enacted on october  and includes a special one time deduction of of certain foreign earnings repatriated to the us in december  the fasb issued fsp fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the ajca  allowing companies additional time to evaluate the effect of the ajca on plans for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings 
we are in the process of evaluating the effects of the repatriation provision  however  we do not expect to complete this evaluation until after congress or the us treasury department provides further clarification on key elements of the provision 
as such  we have not concluded our analysis to determine whether  and to what extent  we might repatriate foreign earnings 
we expect to be in a position to finalize the assessment within a reasonable amount of time after the issuance of clarifying us treasury or congressional guidance

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations and interest rate changes 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to interest expense of variable rate debt 
due to the repurchase and retirement of the remaining balance of our senior subordinated notes  we no longer have any fixed rate borrowings outstanding at january  therefore  market interest rates no longer affect the fair value of our long term debt balances 
since of our debt is now variable rate based  any changes in market interest rates will cause an equal change in our net interest expense 
other than inter company transactions between our domestic and foreign entities  we generally do not have significant transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency applicable to each entity 
we enter into forward and swap contracts to hedge transactions denominated in foreign currencies to reduce the currency risk associated with fluctuating exchange rates 
these contracts are used primarily to hedge payments arising from some of our foreign currency denominated obligations 
realized and unrealized gains and losses from these transactions are included in net income for the period 
in addition  we enter into interest rate swaps to hedge a substantial portion of our variable rate debt 
changes in the fair value of these derivatives will be recorded each period in earnings for non qualifying derivatives or accumulated other comprehensive income loss for qualifying derivatives 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates may also impact our shareholders equity 
the assets and liabilities of our non us subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated into us dollars at the weighted average exchange rate for the period 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
in addition  fluctuations in the value of the euro will cause the us dollar translated amounts to change in comparison to prior periods 
each of our subsidiaries derives revenues and incurs expenses primarily within a single country and  consequently  does not generally incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of normal business operations
