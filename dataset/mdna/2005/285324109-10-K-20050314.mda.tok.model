item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we are a supplier of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and software to the global semiconductor industry  which includes both chip manufacturers and contract test companies 
we are sensitive to a number of key indicators in managing our business 
these include industry and internal book to bill ratios  capital equipment utilization rates  capital spending plans of our customers and in the industry particularly in the mm segment  and competitive wins of our products and our competitor s products 
the demand for our products follows the semiconductor test markets  which have recently started showing signs of growth  yet remain highly cyclical and difficult to forecast 
in addition  our mm wafer probers have not yet achieved broad market acceptance  which has resulted in a significant loss in market share 
the initial product   served the small market for mm parametric and process development applications  but did not adequately meet customers requirements for high volume production test  which is the large majority of the mm prober market 
electroglas has recently introduced a new mm prober  the eg  to serve this much larger market 
to stay competitive  grow our business over the long term  improve our gross margins  and generate operating cash flows  we must continue to invest in new technologies and product enhancements and at the same time  as necessary  rapidly adjust up or down our expense structure during these hard to predict cyclical semiconductor equipment demand cycles 

table of contents in view of the recent prolonged downturn in the semiconductor industry and the resulting market pressures  we are focusing our major efforts in the following areas controlling and aligning our costs and revenues to move to break even and then profitable levels of operation  including positive operating cash flow  developing successful products and services to meet market windows in our target markets  preparing ourselves for increases in customer demand in the current year while at the same time maintaining expense control and limiting increases to our cost structure  and expanding our sales and service capabilities in asia 
critical accounting policies and estimates general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  warranties  and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments or estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee 
for more detail about these accounting policies  see note  significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on the sale of our equipment when we have received a customer purchase order or contract  when we have delivered the products or services  when we can be assured of the total purchase price without making significant concessions and when we are assured of our ability to collect from our customer 
in recognizing revenue we make certain assumptions and estimates  namely i we consider a new system routinely accepted in the marketplace when three to five successful installations based on our acceptance criteria have been put into customer production  ii we consider systems delivered separately from options to have value to our customers on a stand alone basis if the options have a unique price assigned and are not significant to the total amount of the order and the options are not fundamental to the functionality of the system  iii we consider systems delivered separately from installation and training to have value to our customers on a stand alone basis because the equipment can readily be sold by the customer  customers are capable of installing our systems without the support of our installers  installation and training are routine and not consequential to the total value of the transaction  and these services are routinely sold on a stand alone basis  and iv for most customers we assume that  based on past history  we will continue to collect our receivables from our customers without payment or product concessions  despite the fact that they have larger financial size relative to us and despite our dependence on them in a heavily concentrated industry 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at lower of cost or market estimated net realizable value using the first in  first out fifo method 
we may record charges to write down inventory due to excess  obsolete and slow moving inventory based on an analysis of the impact of changes in technology on our products including engineering design changes  the timing of these changes and estimates of future sales volumes 
the projections of changes in technology and forecasts of future sales are estimates 
we write down inventory to net realizable 
table of contents value based on anticipated product orders  product order history  forecasts and backlog to assess our inventory requirements 
if there is weak demand in the semiconductor equipment markets and orders fall below our forecasts  additional write downs of inventories may be required which may negatively impact gross margins in future periods 
we periodically review the carrying value of our inventories by evaluating material usage and requirements to determine obsolescence and excess quantities  and reduce the value when appropriate 
inventory impairment charges are considered to permanently establish a new cost basis for inventory and are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable  except when the associated inventory balances decline due to disposition or sale of associated product 
as a result of these analyses  we wrote down inventories by million  million and million in  and  respectively 
warranty we generally warrant our products for a period of twelve months and we accrue a current liability for the estimated cost of warranty upon shipment 
for our established products  this accrual is based on historical experience  and for our newer products  this accrual is based on estimates from similar products 
in addition  from time to time  specific warranty accruals are made for specific technical problems 
if we experience unforeseen technical problems with our products in future periods to meet our product warranty requirements  revisions to our estimated cost of warranty may be required  and our gross margins will be negatively impacted 
estimates have historically approximated actuals 
allowance for doubtful accounts we closely monitor the collection of our accounts receivables and record a general reserve for doubtful accounts against aged accounts and a specific reserve for identified amounts that we believe are not recoverable 
we sell primarily to large  well established semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor test companies and we have not experienced significant accounts receivable losses in the past 
we have  however  from time to time experienced slowdowns in receivable collections  especially during semiconductor equipment down cycles  as customers extend their payment schedules to conserve their cash balances 
if our customers continue to experience down cycles or their financial conditions were to deteriorate  we may be required to increase our reserve for doubtful accounts 
if a customer demonstrated a pattern of renegotiating terms or requesting concessions prior to payment  we would defer revenue until the price was considered fixed and determinable 
estimates have historically approximated actuals 
long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  the assets will be written down to their estimated fair value 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including long term forecasts of overall market conditions and our market share 
further  in the course of reviewing our business operations  we may consider divesting certain business operations 
changes in these estimates and business divestures could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of the long lived assets  thereby requiring us to record additional asset write downs in the future 
charges related to asset impairments are recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 

table of contents results of operations the components of our statements of operations  expressed as a percentage of net sales  are as follows years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit loss operating expenses engineering  research and development expenses sales  general and administrative expenses restructuring charges impairment charges gains on sales of product lines total operating expenses operating loss interest income interest expense gain on sale of long term investment gain on settlement of long term liability gain on revaluation of warrants other income expense  net loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net loss net sales net sales are comprised of prober systems  software  and aftermarket sales  consisting primarily of services  spare parts  upgrades and training 
service revenue was less than of annual net sales during the last three fiscal years 
net sales of our products are as follows years ended december  in thousands prober systems inspection products test floor management software products dfm  fab and cpm software products aftermarket sales net sales were up in from this increase was primarily due to higher prober system sales  largely in our mm prober product lines  and higher average selling prices  as customers resumed their capital spending in response to indications of a market recovery 
sales of our test floor management software products increased in due to the release of our newest platform in late these increases in prober systems sales and test floor management software in over was partially offset by the elimination of sales in other product lines in due to the sale of our design for manufacturing dfm and 
table of contents fab solutions software product lines in the third quarter of and our optical inspection product line in the fourth quarter of net sales were million in down from million in these decreases were due primarily to lower revenue on system sales of our core prober business as a result of lower sales prices in versus following the downturn in the semiconductor industry as our customers continued to curtail their capital spending in response to persisting excess production capacity conditions as well as a decrease in our market share for prober products 
despite the overall decline in prober revenue in  shipments of prober systems increased in versus net sales in were also down from  due to the sale of our dfm and fab solutions software and inspection product lines 
the demand for our products follows the semiconductor test markets  which remain highly cyclical and difficult to forecast 
as a result of uncertainties in this market environment  any rescheduling or cancellation of planned capital purchases by our customers will cause our sales to fluctuate on a quarterly basis 
sales to related parties are priced in the same manner as other customers 
net sales by region were as follows years ended december  in thousands of sales of sales of sales north america europe asia international sales as a percentage of total sales for the years  and were  and  respectively 
we expect international sales to represent a significant percentage of net sales and fluctuate as a percentage of total sales as individual manufacturers and semiconductor test companies address their capacity needs at differing stages of the semiconductor demand cycle 
during and  we experienced weakness across all of our major geographic regions 
sales to asia and europe were primarily denominated in united states dollars  except for france where the invoiced currency was a mix of the united states dollar and the euro 
gross profit loss gross profit loss  as a percentage of sales  was  and in  and  respectively 
the improvement in gross profit in compared to was due to higher unit sales volumes and higher average selling prices 
additionally  manufacturing overhead expenses as a percentage of sales were lower in than and lower than as a result of our relocation of manufacturing operations from the us to singapore and other restructuring efforts begun in late and completed in mid the improvement in gross profit in compared to due to lower manufacturing overhead expenses as a percentage of sales was offset somewhat by lower revenue per system due to lower average selling prices in as compared to in addition  we wrote down inventories by million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we periodically review the carrying value of our inventories by evaluating material usage and manufacturing requirements to determine inventory obsolescence and excess quantities  and we reduce the carrying value of inventory when appropriate 
the write down in fiscal resulted primarily from identified obsolescence of certain parts resulting from the planned transition to new products in the write down in fiscal resulted primarily from identified obsolescence of discontinued and sold product lines as we focused our business on our core prober products 
we generally warrant our products for a period of twelve months and accrue the estimated cost of warranty upon shipment 
in  due to the sale of the inspection product lines  the accrued liability for estimated cost of warranty was increased by million for additional costs to outsource support of customers through the end of their warranty term and for additional warranties associated with discontinuing and selling the product lines 
in  the accrued liability for estimated cost of inspection product line warranty support was reduced by 
table of contents million 
in due to the establishment of new manufacturing operations in singapore and the potential for higher defect rates from the new plant  the accrued liability for estimated cost of warranty was increased by million from the previous year 
we believe that our gross profit will continue to be affected by a number of factors  including changes in demand for semiconductors  competitive pressures on average selling prices  product mix  the level of software sales  our share of the available market  and excess manufacturing capacity costs 
continued weak demand and changes in market conditions may cause orders to be below forecasts  which may result in additional excess inventory  which would cause additional write downs of inventories and would negatively impact gross profit in future periods 
engineering  research and development expenses engineering  research and development  or er d expenses were  and  respectively as a percentage of sales  for   and  respectively 
in  er d expenses were million down from million in this decrease in spending year over year was primarily due to a reduction in employee headcount and related costs and a reduction associated with the product lines sold in the second half of  partially offset by increased spending on materials and services 
as a percentage of sales  er d expenses decreased in as a result of the effect of higher net sales  an additional as a result of the absence of spending for product lines sold in  and an additional as a result of reduced spending 
in  er d expenses were million  down from million in this decrease  as a percentage of sales and in spending year over year  was primarily due to reduced employee headcount and related costs  reductions in outside services and reduced costs due to the sale of software product lines to fei company in mid during these hard to predict cyclical semiconductor equipment demand cycles  we intend to control discretionary expenses and continue investing in our new product programs 
engineering  research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  project materials  consultant fees  and other costs associated with our ongoing efforts in hardware and software product development and enhancement 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative  or sg a expenses were  and  as a percentage of sales  in  and  respectively 
in  sg a expenses were million down from million in this decrease in absolute dollars was primarily due to the non recurrence of an additional rent charge of million recorded in the first quarter of related to the amortization of the deficiency between the fair value and the guaranteed residual value of our san jose campus 
in addition  savings in sg a expenses during included reduced salaries and other cost savings as a result of headcount reductions  spending restrictions and cost control measures 
these savings during were partially offset by a million increase in sarbanes oxley compliance costs 
as a percentage of sales  sg a expenses decreased in as a result of the effect of higher sales and an additional as a result of lower spending 
in  sg a expenses were million  down from million in this decrease was primarily due to headcount reductions and other cost savings as a result of spending restrictions and cost control measures 
these decreases were partially offset by increased commissions to outside sales representatives because of increased sales to asia and the additional rent charge of million recorded in the first quarter of sg a expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits  travel  advertising and other promotion expenses  facilities expenses  legal expenses and other infrastructure costs 
as a result of the sale of our san jose campus in january  we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease by approximately million in compared to consisting of savings on property taxes  utilities  insurance and depreciation offset by rental expense for our new corporate headquarters 

table of contents restructuring charges singapore relocation and us workforce reduction in january  we announced a restructuring plan to reduce our us workforce and exit certain facilities in connection with the relocation of our manufacturing operations to singapore 
as a result of the continued semiconductor equipment downturn  and to better align our cost structure with the market demand for our products  we announced further workforce reductions in october overall  employees were designated for termination and employees were terminated 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million in as of december   there were employees designated for termination 
during  an additional employees were designated for termination and were terminated 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million in  primarily for severance packages 
during  an additional employees were designated for termination in connection with a restructuring plan adopted for our engineering  research and development operations and were terminated 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million in related to office space reductions and severance packages 
international office closures during september and october of  we announced plans to close our sales office in japan and other offices in europe and asia 
during the fourth quarter of  employees were designated for termination and were terminated 
in  we recorded a restructuring charge of million for severance payments  legal and accounting fees related to the closures  and asset write downs 
in  nine employees designated to be terminated in were removed from the termination list  primarily due to the sale of certain product lines 
further  we recorded an additional restructuring charge of million in  primarily due to additional costs for office closures 
as a result of the restructuring efforts  we expect engineering  research and development payroll and benefit payments to decrease by million to million in compared to restructuring charges of million are included in accrued liabilities and are anticipated to be substantially paid in impairment charges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we performed impairment tests as of december  and  which compared currently utilized property and equipment and non current assets net book values with the expected undiscounted cash flows from these assets 
the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the assets currently in use were sufficient to recover the net book value of these assets 
on december   we entered into an agreement to sell our san jose campus to integrated device technology for approximately million and recorded a million impairment charge 
in addition  we recorded a million impairment charge on fixed assets 
due to continued declines in corporate real estate values in the san jose area  management concluded as of december  that there were indicators of impairment for the portion of the corporate campus that was currently not being utilized and undertook a review of the value of these assets for possible impairment 
based on management s evaluation and the results of an independent appraisal  we recorded an impairment charge of million for the unused portion of our corporate campus 
in addition  we recorded a million impairment charge for fixed assets that were no longer in use 
in  we performed a similar impairment test of property and equipment and non current assets 
based on the quoted market price of the estimated fair value of the assets  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write down the carrying value of certain fixed assets and non current assets held for use in the prober division to their estimated fair values 
we also recorded million related to the write down of our long term minority equity investment in nanonexus 
although we do not anticipate that we will be required to record additional impairment charges  the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and the severity of these cycles is difficult to predict 
during a down cycle  we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions  which could therefore affect our net sales and the sufficiency of estimated future cash flows to recover net book value of these assets and require us to record additional impairment charges 

table of contents gains on sales of product lines on july   we sold certain software product lines cadnav  merlin  yieldmanager  lcd ym and related assets to fei company fei for million in cash million escrowed and restricted for one year plus the assumption by fei of million of liabilities 
in  we recorded a gain on this sale of million  after deducting from the consideration the book value of sold assets  transaction and other related costs  and our obligation to fei under indemnification provisions of the agreement 
on november   we sold the inspection products line and related assets to ats systems oregon  inc ats for million in cash  net of selling expenses  plus the assumption by ats of million of warranty obligations 
in  we recorded a gain on this sale of million  after deducting from the consideration the book value of sold assets  transaction and other related costs  and our obligation to ats under indemnification provisions of the agreement 
interest income interest income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the year over year decreases were principally due to lower average yearly cash and short term investment balances  which declined each year 
cash and short term investment balances have declined as a result of the purchase of our corporate campus in q and cash in operations in  and interest expense interest expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
interest expense is primarily comprised of interest expense on our convertible subordinated notes issued in june the year over year increase from to and was principally due to a full year of interest paid on convertible notes in and compared to one half year paid in in addition  included a million non cash interest expense charge related to the beneficial conversion feature triggered during the first quarter related to our convertible subordinated notes see note  convertible subordinated notes and warrants 
gain on revaluation of warrants in june  we completed a million private placement of convertible subordinated notes due in and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
in september  upon registration of our notes  warrants  and the shares of common stock into which the notes and warrants are convertible  the warrants  which were initially valued at million and classified as a liability  were revalued using the black scholes option pricing model to million and reclassified to equity 
this revaluation resulted in a gain on revaluation of million 
upon registration of the notes  warrants  and shares of common stock into which the notes and warrants are convertible  the re measured value of the warrants was reclassified to permanent equity 
gain on sale of long term investment in the fourth quarter of  we sold our minority equity investment in cascade microtech  inc in connection with their initial public offering 
we received million in net proceeds from the sale  and we recorded a gain of million 
gain on settlement of long term liability in the third quarter of  we recognized an million gain on the settlement of a long term liability to our former parent company that reduced the amounts payable by us under a tax benefit sharing agreement from million to an aggregate of million to be paid over the next seven quarters starting in the fourth quarter of as of december   the accrued liability for this obligation was million 

table of contents provision benefit for income taxes the income tax provision benefit was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the income tax provision resulted from taxes assessed on the income of various foreign branches 
the income tax benefit resulted from a reversal of previously recorded income tax reserves based on changes in estimated exposures in tax jurisdictions 
the income tax benefit primarily resulted from a million additional refund due to a change in tax law arising from the enactment of the job creation and worker assistance act of and a million reversal of previously recorded income tax reserves for tax years up to and including relating principally to changes in estimates of these tax reserves 
realization of our deferred tax assets depends on us generating sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences and from net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of such realization  our management concluded that a full valuation allowance of million was required at december  in october of  the american jobs protection act was signed into law 
certain provisions of this act allow multinational companies to repatriate cash related foreign earnings at a favorable rate if used to create or maintain jobs in the united states 
at december   there are no plans in place to repatriate earnings from foreign subsidiaries as the only cash maintained in these entities is for working capital purposes 
any repatriation of foreign earnings will have an immaterial effect on income taxes 
corporate campus in march  we entered into a million  five year synthetic lease for approximately acres of land in san jose  california 
a synthetic lease is a lease that is treated as an operating lease for accounting purposes and a capital lease for tax purposes 
under our synthetic lease  third party lessors funded of the acquisition and construction costs relating to properties leased to us for our corporate campus 
in january  we provided the lessors with a notice to purchase the san jose  california property by march in december  we received a fair market appraisal of the property for million  million less than the guaranteed residual lease value of million 
under eitf  implementation issues in accounting for leasing transactions involving special purpose entities  beginning on the date the deficiency becomes probable  the expected deficiency is accrued by the lessee using the straight line method over the remaining term of the lease 
because we made a determination in december to purchase the leased assets by march  the gross lease payments were calculated over the remaining four months of the lease 
thus  we began amortizing the million deficiency at million per month effective december  and recorded million of additional rent expense in the first quarter of we completed the purchase of the property in march the long term lease receivable and cash collateral were used to fund the purchase price 
the land and buildings were recorded at fair value plus closing costs  approximately million and the accrued rent of million was paid 
as a result of the purchase  depreciation expense increased by approximately million per year  and rent expense and interest income decreased by approximately million and million  respectively  per year based on current interest rates  effective the second quarter of in december  we entered into an agreement to sell our san jose campus to integrated device technology on january  for million  and we continue to occupy certain portions of the buildings through june  under a rent free lease back 
we measured the fair value of the land and buildings as of december  based upon the sale price net of closing costs and recorded a million impairment charge 
the assets included in this agreement were classified as assets held for sale as of december  at their fair market value of million 
liquidity and capital resources our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million at december   a decrease of million from million at december  
table of contents cash used in operating activities in was million  an improvement of million over million in cash used in operating activities in was million  an improvement of million over million used in operating activities in our net operating loss before restructuring and impairment charges and gains on sales of product lines decreased by million in to million compared to million in this resulted in a million improvement in cash used in operating activities in compared to primarily reflecting our reduced net operating loss period over period due to increased sales volumes and a decrease in operating expenses 
additionally  the improvement in net cash used in operations resulted from a decrease of million in accounts receivable due to enhanced collection efforts 
these improvements were partially offset by an increase of million in inventory from increased material purchases to support higher sales volumes and decreases of million in accounts payable and million in accrued liabilities 
non cash charges included in our net operating loss before restructuring and impairment charges and gains on sales of product lines in consisted primarily of million depreciation and amortization and million of inventory charges 
these non cash charges in decreased by million from million in we expect cash used in operating activities to decrease further in compared to due to anticipated increased gross margins in on increased sales  anticipated savings from restructuring efforts  anticipated lower spending levels due to the sale of the san jose campus and ongoing efforts to maintain expense controls  continued efforts to ensure timely collections from our customers  and continued efforts to tightly control inventory purchases 
cash provided by investing activities was million in largely due to the sale of our long term minority investment in cascade microtech  inc for million in december our use of investments decreased by million in to million as compared to million in due to our decreased use of cash in operations 
cash used in financing activities in was million primarily due to million in interest payments on convertible subordinated notes partially offset by million proceeds of sales of common stock to employees 
cash used in financing activities in was million primarily due to million in interest payments on convertible subordinated notes partially offset by million proceeds of sales of common stock to employees 
in june  we completed a million private placement of fixed rate convertible subordinated notes due and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
the net proceeds from this placement were million 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually on the fifteenth of june and december each year 
annual interest payments are million 
the convertible notes initially enabled the holders to convert principal amounts owed under the notes into an aggregate of  shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the notes contain a beneficial conversion feature  which was triggered on february  as a result  the conversion price was lowered to per share and an additional  common shares will be issuable upon conversion of the notes 
this adjustment to the conversion price resulted in a million non cash charge to interest expense in our first quarter of in january  we entered into a three year operating lease for a  square foot manufacturing facility in singapore with annual lease payments of approximately million 
this lease was renewed at the same rate in december under a two year renewal option 
in february  we entered into a five year operating lease for a  square foot corporate headquarters building in san jose  california 
payments are due under this new lease as follows nil in less than year  million in years  and million in years 
in  we anticipate spending approximately million to million on tenant improvements and furniture and fixtures for the new corporate facility 
our principal source of liquidity as of december  consisted of million of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
in addition  we received million cash on january  from the sale of our san jose corporate campus 
during  we continued to emphasize reduction of our utilization of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  including improving gross margins on sales  maintaining 
table of contents spending controls and additional headcount reductions 
this reduced utilization of cash in operating activities resulted in the use of million in the first quarter  the providing of cash through operating activities of million in the second quarter  the use of million in the third quarter and the use of million in the fourth quarter a net use of cash in operating activities of million for the year ended december  we currently anticipate that our available cash and cash equivalents at december  combined with the proceeds from the sale of our san jose campus on january  should be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures to support planned activities through the demand for our products follows the semiconductor test markets which remain highly cyclical and difficult to forecast 
we are committed to the successful execution of our operating plan and will take further action as necessary to align our operations and reduce expenses 
external financing vehicles have been and are expected to continue to be available to us 
in the third quarter of  we established a revolving line of credit agreement with comerica bank under which we may borrow up to million based upon eligible accounts receivable balances 
this line of credit is secured by certain of our assets and requires that we maintain certain minimum financial covenants 
the company currently maintains cash deposits of million that will be considered restricted as compensating balances to the extent we borrow against the revolving line of credit 
as of december   cash obligations are as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating leases purchase commitments settlement agreements interest payments on convertible subordinated notes principal payment on convertible subordinated notes total cash obligations purchase commitments include million of purchase orders that are cancelable if business conditions indicate that further curtailment of spending is necessary 
we have indemnified idt for two years with respect to representations and warranties made by us related to the sale of our san jose campus 
the limit of electroglas liability for breach of the representations and warranties was million in the sale agreement  and a million reserve was recorded in january for the net present value of the company s guarantee obligations under the indemnification provisions

 statement of cash flows 
sfas r is effective at the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning after june  generally  the approach to accounting for share based payments in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values ie  pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we plan to adopt sfas r in the third quarter of while the effect of the adoption is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial position or cash flows  it is expected to have a material impact on our results of operations 
for the third and fourth quarters of  we expect to record stock based compensation charges of approximately million and million  respectively  using the black scholes 
table of contents model to value options issued and outstanding as of december  we are currently evaluating the available option pricing models  which will be utilized in implementing sfas r 
the amount of stock based compensation charges related to grants cannot be estimated at this time

sfas amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
paragraph of arb  chapter  previously stated that under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges sfas requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  sfas requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
we plan to adopt sfas in fiscal and the effect of the adoption is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
factors that may affect results and financial condition semiconductor industry downturns adversely affect our revenues and operating results 
our business largely depends on capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor test companies  which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products that use integrated circuits 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has historically experienced periods of oversupply resulting in significantly reduced demand for capital equipment 
the most recent downturn  which began in  was severe and prolonged 
as a result  our ability to accurately forecast future revenues and expense levels is limited 
during a down cycle  we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions 
our ability to reduce expenses may be limited by the need to invest in the engineering  research and development and marketing required to penetrate targeted markets and maintain extensive customer service and support 
during periods of rapid growth  we must be able to rapidly increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand 
we cannot assure our investors that these objectives can be met  which would likely have a material and adverse effect on our business and operating results 
our historical financial results have been  and our future financial results are anticipated to be  subject to substantial fluctuations 
total revenues for were million compared to million in and million in the increase in was due primarily to increased unit volume sales combined with higher average selling prices on our prober systems 
the decline in was due primarily to lower revenue on system sales of our core prober business as a result of the recent semiconductor industry downturn  excess capacity and the global economic slowdown combined with lower software and inspection products revenues due to the sale of our software and inspection product lines during we incurred an operating loss of million in compared to an operating loss of million in and million in in  customers resumed their capital spending in response to recent indications of a possible market recovery  however the demand for our products follows the semiconductor test markets  which remain highly cyclical and difficult to forecast 
recent announcements in the semiconductor test markets indicate a slowing trend affecting our customers capital purchases 
another economic slowdown and or changes in demand for our products and services and other factors could continue to adversely affect our business in the near term  and we may experience additional declines in revenue and increases in operating losses 
we cannot assure our investors that we will be able to return to operating profitability or that  if we do  we will be able to sustain it 
we currently anticipate that our future cash from operations  available cash and cash equivalents and available credit facilities at december  combined with proceeds from the sale of our san jose campus should be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures through the next twelve months 
however  we 
table of contents may require additional capital to fund our future operations 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on terms favorable to us  we may not be able to continue to operate our business pursuant to our current business plan and our ability to run our business would be impacted 
our operating results are subject to variability and uncertainty  which could negatively impact our stock price 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in our results 
our backlog at the beginning of each period does not necessarily determine actual sales for any succeeding period 
our sales have often reflected orders shipped in the same period that they were received 
however  customers may cancel or reschedule shipments  and production difficulties could delay shipments 
for the years ended december   and  five of our customers accounted for  and  respectively  of our net sales 
if one or more of our major customers delayed  ceased or significantly curtailed its purchases  it could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate and would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
other factors that may influence our operating results in a particular quarter include the timing of the receipt of orders from major customers  product mix  competitive pricing pressures  the relative proportions of domestic and international sales  our ability to design  manufacture and introduce new products on a cost effective and timely basis  the delay between expenses to further develop marketing and service capabilities and the realization of benefits from those improved capabilities  and the introduction of new products by our competitors 
accordingly  our results of operations are subject to significant variability and uncertainty from quarter to quarter  which could adversely affect our stock price 
if we do not continue to develop and successfully market new products  our business will be negatively affected 
we believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to continue to enhance existing products and to develop and manufacture new products  particularly those related to the implementation of our strategy to become a process management tool provider 
as a result  we expect to continue investing in selective new wafer prober product development programs  although we expect engineering  research and development expenses to decrease in due to the completion of several product development programs 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in the introduction  marketing and cost effective manufacture of any of our new products  that we will be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner  enhance our existing products and processes to satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance  or that the new markets for which we are developing new products or expect to sell current products  such as the market for mm wafer probers  markets related to the growth of the strip test market for final test will develop sufficiently 
to develop new products successfully  we depend on close relationships with our customers and the willingness of those customers to share information with us 
the failure to develop products and introduce them successfully and in a timely manner could adversely affect our competitive position and results of operations 
for example  our mm wafer probers have not yet achieved broad market acceptance  which has resulted in a significant loss in market share 
if we do not successfully compete in the markets in which we do business  our business and results of operations will be negatively affected 
our major competitors in the prober market are tokyo electron limited and tokyo seimitsu  both of which are based in japan 
in this market  these competitors have greater financial  engineering and manufacturing resources than we do as well as larger service organizations and long standing customer relationships 
our competitors can be expected to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive price performance characteristics 
competitive pressures may force price reductions that could adversely affect our results of operations 
although we believe we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors  maintaining and capitalizing on these advantages will require us to continue a high level of investment in engineering  research and development  marketing  and customer service and support 
we can not assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages 
our outstanding convertible notes may be required to be repaid if not converted prior to their maturity  and may  if converted  result in additional dilution to holders of our common stock  all of which may adversely affect the value of our common stock 
in june  we issued million in convertible notes and related warrants 

table of contents the notes entitle the holders to convert the notes into an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  significantly in excess of recent trading prices of our common stock 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  we also issued warrants for the purchase of  shares of our common stock that are exercisable at a price of per share  also significantly in excess of recent trading prices of our common stock 
in certain circumstances  we may force the conversion of all or a portion of the notes and may also redeem the notes 
however  unless prior to june the price of our common stock exceeds at least per share  we cannot force the automatic conversion of the notes and we will be obligated to pay the notes in full at maturity 
we may voluntarily redeem the notes between june and june for an aggregate redemption price of as high as approximately million plus accrued interest 
in addition  unless waived or renegotiated  we are obligated to pay the holders of the notes an amount equal to million plus accrued interest in the event of a sale  merger or other change in control of the company 
if we do not successfully protect our intellectual property  our business could be negatively impacted 
our success depends in significant part on our intellectual property 
while we attempt to protect our intellectual property through patents  copyrights and trade secrets  we believe that our success will depend more upon innovation  technological expertise and distribution strength 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully protect our technology or that competitors will not be able to develop similar technology independently 
no assurance can be given that the claims allowed on any patents we hold will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  we cannot assure you that any patents issued to us will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with competitive advantages 
some customers using certain of our products have received letters from technivison corporation and the lemelson medical education research foundation  or lemelson  alleging that the manufacture of semiconductor products infringes certain patents currently held by lemelson 
we believe that our products do not infringe the lemelson patents and to our knowledge  lemelson has not asserted that we may be liable for infringing its patents 
in january  the trial court held that the patent claims at issue were invalid  unenforceable and not infringed by the suppliers 
lemelson has appealed this decision 
given the pending appeal  and the inherent uncertain in litigation  we cannot assure you that the ultimate outcome will be favorable to us nor can we predict the effect of such litigation on our business 
for a further discussion  see part ii 
other information item legal proceedings 
disruptions or termination of some of our key sources of supplies could damage our customer relations and harm our business 
we use numerous suppliers to supply components and subassemblies for the manufacture and support of our products and systems 
while we make reasonable efforts to ensure that such components and subassemblies are available from multiple suppliers  this is not always possible 
although we seek to reduce our dependence on these limited source suppliers  disruption or termination of certain of these sources could occur and such disruptions could have at least a temporary adverse effect on our results of operations and damage customer relationships 
moreover  a prolonged inability to obtain certain components  or a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we do not successfully address the challenges inherent in conducting international sales and operations  our business and results of operations will be negatively impacted 
we have experienced fluctuations in our international sales and operations 
international sales accounted for  and of our net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect international sales to continue to represent a significant percentage of net sales 
we are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets  one or more of which could adversely affect our international sales and operations  including the imposition of government controls on our business and or business partners  fluctuations in the us dollar  which could increase our foreign sales prices in local currencies  export license requirements  restrictions on the export of technology  
table of contents changes in tariffs  legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  strikes  longer payment cycles  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable in foreign countries  withholding taxes that limit the repatriation of earnings  trade barriers and restrictions  immigration regulations that limit our ability to deploy employees  political instability  war and acts of terrorism  natural disasters  and variations in effective income tax rates among countries where we conduct business 
although these and similar regulatory  geopolitical and global economic factors have not yet had a material adverse effect on our operations  there can be no assurance that such factors will not adversely impact our operations in the future or require us to modify our current business practices 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries where we do business may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
further  we have found it difficult to penetrate the large japanese market  which represents a significant percentage of the worldwide wafer prober market 
our past sales in japan have not been significant 
our business will be harmed if we cannot hire and retain key employees 
our future success partly depends on our ability to hire and retain key personnel 
we also need to attract additional skilled personnel in all areas to grow our business 
while many of our current employees have many years of service with us  there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our existing personnel or attract additional qualified employees in the future 
approximately half of our outstanding common stock options have an exercise price above the current market price of our common stock 
our charter documents and shareholders rights plan  as well as delaware law  could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us 
our shareholders rights plan and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and delaware law could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in our control 
such provisions could diminish the opportunities for a stockholder to participate in tender offers  including tender offers at a price above the then current market value of our common stock 
such provisions may also inhibit fluctuations in the market price of our common stock that could result from takeover attempts 
in addition  the board of directors  without further stockholder approval  may issue additional series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in our control 
the issuance of additional series of preferred stock could also adversely affect the voting power of the holders of common stock  including the loss of voting control to others 
we have no current plans to issue any preferred stock 
while we believe that we currently have adequate internal controls over financial reporting  we are exposed to risks from recent legislation requiring companies to evaluate those internal controls 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires our management to report on  and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  the effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting 
we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements 
this legislation is relatively new and neither companies nor accounting firms have significant experience in complying with its requirements 
as a result  we have incurred increased expense and devoted additional management resources to section compliance 
further  the costs and management time relating to compliance with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of in the future may also be substantial 
in the 
table of contents event that our chief executive officer  chief financial officer or independent registered public accounting firm determine that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective as defined under section  investor perceptions of the company may be adversely affected and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock 
changes in stock option accounting rules may adversely affect our reported operating results  our stock price  and our ability to attract and retain employees 
in december  the financial accounting standards board published new rules that will require companies in to record all stock based employee compensation as an expense 
the new rules apply to stock options grants  as well as a wide range of other share based compensation arrangements including restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans 
we will begin to apply the new financial accounting rules in the quarter ending september  in the past  we have depended upon compensating our officers  directors  employees and consultants in part with such stock based compensation awards to attract and retain officers  directors  employees and consultants 
accordingly  if we continue to grant stock options or other stock based compensation awards to our officers  directors  employees  and consultants after the new rules apply to us  our future earnings  if any  will be reduced or our future losses will be increased by the expenses recorded for those grants 
these compensation expenses may be larger than the compensation expense that we would be required to record were we able to compensate these persons with cash in lieu of securities 
since we are a small company  the expenses we may have to record as a result of future options grants may be significant and may materially negatively affect our reported financial results 
the adverse effects that the new accounting rules may have on our future financial statements should we continue to rely on stock based compensation may reduce our stock price and make it more difficult for us to attract new investors 
in addition  reducing our use of stock plans to reward and incent our officers  directors and employees  could result in a competitive disadvantage to us in the employee marketplace and make it difficult to attract and retain key personnel 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk at december   our cash equivalents and short term investments consisted primarily of fixed income securities 
we maintain an investment policy  which ensures the safety and the preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and may decline in value when interest rates change 
if a basis point change occurred in the value of our portfolio  the impact on our financial statements would be approximately million 
the table below presents notional amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment and debt portfolios in thousands  except percentages maturity in maturity in maturity in total fair value at december  investments cash equivalents average rate short term investments average rate debt convertible subordinated notes fixed rate foreign currency exchange rate risk we believe that our current foreign exchange exposure in all international operations is not material to our consolidated financial statements because we primarily transact in us dollars 
accordingly  we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge our current foreign exchange exposure 
we believe the impact of a change in exchange rates would not be material to our financial condition and results of operations 
for further discussion regarding the effect of foreign currency accounting on our business  see note to our consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies  foreign currency accounting 
there have been no significant changes in our market risk from the prior year
