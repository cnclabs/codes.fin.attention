item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
lime produced at the company s adams  massachusetts facility is used as a raw material for the manufacture of pcc at that site and at some satellite pcc plants  and is sold commercially to various chemical and other industries 
the company mines  beneficiates and processes talc at its barretts site  located near dillon  montana and processes purchased talc in mt 
vernon and wellsville  ohio 
the talc is sold worldwide in finely ground form for paint and coatings  ceramic and polymer applications 
because of the exceptional chemical purity of the barretts ore  a majority of automotive catalytic converter ceramic substrates manufactured in the united states  japan and western europe contain the company s barretts talc 
the company s natural mineral products are supported by the company s limestone reserves located in the western and eastern parts of the united states  and talc reserves located in montana 
the company estimates these reserves  at current usage levels  to be in excess of years at its limestone production facilities and in excess of years at its talc production facility 
the company also has two mineral processing plants in the midwest united states  which process high quality mineral ores imported from foreign sources into performance minerals for the plastics  paint  adhesive and sealants  rubber and cosmetic industries 
this capability was obtained through the acquisition of the business and assets of polar minerals inc in the third quarter of refractories segment refractory products and markets refractories products the company offers a broad range of monolithic and pre cast refractory products  systems and services 
the company s refractory segment net sales were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
refractory product sales are often supported by company supplied proprietary application equipment and on site technical service support 
the company s proprietary application equipment is used to apply refractory materials to the walls of steel making furnaces and other high temperature vessels to maintain and extend their lives 
net sales of refractory products  including those for non ferrous applications  were million  million and million for the years ended december   and robotic type shooters  including the company s proprietary scantrol application system  sequad sprayer and its minscan system  allow for remote controlled application in steel making furnaces  as well as in steel ladles and blast furnaces 
since the steel making industry is characterized by intense price competition  which results in a continuing emphasis on increased productivity  the scantrol application system  sequad sprayer  the minscan system  and the related technologically advanced refractory materials developed in the company s research laboratories have been well accepted by the company s customers 
these products allow steel makers to improve their performance through  among other things  the application of monolithic refractories to furnace linings while the furnace is at operating temperature  thereby eliminating the need for furnace cool down periods and steel production interruption 
the result is a lower overall refractory cost per ton of steel produced to steel makers 
the company s experienced technical service staff and advanced application equipment provide customers assurance that they will achieve their desired productivity objectives 
the company s technicians are also able to conduct laser measurement of refractory wear  usually in conjunction with robotic application tools  to improve maintenance performance at many locations 
the company believes that these services  together with its refractory product offerings  provide it with a strategic marketing advantage 
over the past several years a significant amount of the company s refractory product sales have come from new products 
some of the new products the company has introduced in the past few years included the mag o star and mag o star alm spray coatings  an advanced refractory material for application to the slag line at the top of hot steel ladles increasing availability  balancing wear and extending lining life  innovations to the optishot family of refractory products  the minscan application system  a fully automated application system for applying refractory materials to electric arc furnaces  lacam and visiontech laser based refractory measurement systems  and scantrol  a fully integrated application system combining the lacam and minscan technologies 
the company has also expanded its refractories business through selective acquisitions over the past several years 
in  the company acquired ferrotron elektronik gmbh  a manufacturer of advanced laser scanning devices  sensors and other instruments designed for the steel industry 
in  the company acquired the refractories business of martin marietta magnesia specialties inc and purchased rijnstaal bv  a netherlands based producer of cored metal wires used mainly in the steel and foundry industries 
these acquisitions have increased the breadth of the product lines and markets served by the refractories segment 
in  the company acquired visiontech  a finland based company that develops and manufactures a refractory lining measuring system 
in  the company acquired the assets of isa manufacturing  inc  a us based company that develops and manufactures pre cast refractory shapes 
refractories markets the principal market for the company s refractory products is the steel industry 
management believes that certain trends in the steel industry will continue to provide growth opportunities for the company 
these trends included rapid growth in select geographic regions eg  china  the development of improved manufacturing processes such as thin slab casting  the trend in north america to shift production from integrated mills to mini mills electric arc furnaces and the ever increasing need for improved productivity and longer lasting refractories 
the company believes that the trend toward electric steel making mini mills and away from integrated steel mills has facilitated the acceptance of its new refractory products and technologies 
the company sells its refractory products in the following markets steel furnace 
the company sells gunnable monolithic refractory products and application systems to users of basic oxygen furnaces and electric furnaces for application on furnace walls to prolong the life of furnace linings 
other iron and steel 
the company sells monolithic refractory materials and pre cast refractory shapes for iron and steel ladles  vacuum degassers  continuous casting tundishes  blast furnaces and reheating furnaces 
the company offers a full line of materials to satisfy all continuous casting refractory applications 
this full line consists of gunnable materials  refractory shapes and permanent linings 
industrial refractory systems 
the company sells refractory shapes and linings to non steel refractories consuming industries including glass  cement  aluminum and petrochemicals and other non steel industries  as well as pyroid pyrolitic graphite sold primarily to the aerospace and electronics industries 
metallurgical products and markets the company produces a number of other technologically enhanced products for the steel industry 
these include calcium metal  metallurgical wires and a number of metal treatment specialties 
net sales of metallurgical products were million  million and million for the years ended december   and the company manufactures calcium metal at its canaan  connecticut  facility and purchases calcium in international markets 
calcium metal is used in the manufacture of the company s pferrocal solid core calcium wire  and is sold for use in the manufacture of batteries and magnets 
the company sells metallurgical wires and associated wire injection equipment for use in the production of high quality steels 
the company s metallurgical wires are injected into molten steel to reduce imperfections 
the steel produced is used for high pressure pipeline and other premium grade steel applications 
marketing and sales the company relies principally on its worldwide direct sales force to market its products 
the direct sales force is augmented by technical service teams that are familiar with the industries to which the company markets its products  and by several regional distributors 
the company s sales force works closely with the company s technical service staff to solve technical and other issues faced by the company s customers 
the company s technical service staff assists paper producers in ongoing evaluations of the use of pcc for paper coating and filling applications 
in the refractory segment  the company s technical service personnel advise with respect to the use of refractory materials and  in many cases  apply the refractory materials to the customers furnaces and other vessels pursuant to service agreements 
continued use of skilled technical service teams is an important component of the company s business strategy 
the company works closely with its customers to ensure that their requirements are satisfied and often trains and supports customer personnel in the use of the company s products 
the company conducts domestic marketing and sales from bethlehem  pennsylvania  and from regional sales offices in the eastern and western united states 
the company s international marketing effort is directed from brussels  belgium  tokyo  japan  sao paulo  brazil  singapore  and shanghai  china 
the company believes its refractory manufacturing facilities are strategically located to satisfy the stringent delivery requirements of the steel industry 
the company also believes that its worldwide network of sales personnel and manufacturing sites facilitates the international expansion of its satellite pcc operations 
raw materials the company s ability to achieve anticipated results depends in part on having an adequate supply of raw materials for its manufacturing operations  particularly lime and carbon dioxide for the pcc product line  magnesia for its refractory operations and talc ore for its processed minerals product line  and on having adequate access to the ore reserves at its mining operations 
the company uses lime in the production of pcc and is a significant purchaser of lime worldwide 
generally  lime is purchased under long term supply contracts from unaffiliated suppliers located in close geographic proximity to the company s pcc plants 
the principal raw materials used in the company s monolithic refractory products are refractory grade magnesia and various forms of aluminosilicates 
the company also purchases calcium metal  calcium silicide  graphite  calcium carbide and various alloys for use in the production of metallurgical wires and uses lime and aluminum in the production of calcium metal 
the company purchases a significant portion of its magnesite requirements from sources in the people s republic of china 
high demand for bulk raw materials from the people s republic of china is causing shortages and price increases of some key raw materials  such as coke  that are critical to the steel making process which could lead to some steel production curtailment  which ultimately could affect the company s sales to these customers 
the company also purchases a portion of its talc ore for its processed minerals product line from the people s republic of china  which are also affected by some of these higher costs 
in addition  higher shipping costs are also increasing the delivered cost of raw materials imported from china to north america and europe 
the company believes that in the event of supply interruptions of its refractory raw material requirements it could obtain adequate supplies from alternate sources at reasonable costs 
competition the company is continually engaged in efforts to develop new products and technologies and refine existing products and technologies in order to remain competitive and to position itself as a market leader 
with respect to its pcc products  the company competes for sales to the paper industry with other fillers  such as ground limestone and clay  based in large part upon technological know how  patents and processes that allow the company to deliver pcc that it believes imparts superior brightness  opacity and other properties to paper on an economical basis 
the company is the leading manufacturer and supplier of pcc to the north american paper industry 
it competes with certain companies both in north america and abroad that sell pcc or offer alternative products  principally ground calcium carbonate  for use in paper filling and coating applications 
competition with respect to the company s pcc sales is based upon performance characteristics of the product such as brightness and opacity  price  the availability of technical support and availability of raw materials 
with respect to the company s refractory products  competitive conditions vary by geographic region 
competition is based upon the performance characteristics of the product including strength  consistency and ease of application  price  and the availability of technical support 
the company competes with different companies in different geographic areas and in separate aspects of its product line 
the company competes in sales of its limestone and talc based primarily upon quality  price  and geographic location 
research and development many of the company s product lines are technology based 
the company s expertise in inorganic chemistry  crystallography and structural analysis  fine particle technology and other aspects of materials science apply to and support all of its product lines 
the company s business strategy for continued growth in sales and profitability depends to a large extent on the continued success of its research and development activities 
among the significant achievements of the company s research and development effort have been the satellite pcc plant concept  at pcc  advanced opacarb pcc crystal morphologies for paper coating  the mag o star family of refractory spray coatings  optishot shotcrete refractory products  sequad sprayer  minscan and scantrol application systems 
the company s research and development efforts have also resulted in the invention of synsil products  a family of composite mineral products for the glass industry 
for the years ended december   and  the company expended approximately million  million and million  respectively  on research and development 
the company s research and development spending for was approximately of net sales 
the company maintains its primary research facilities in bethlehem and easton  pennsylvania 
it also has research and development facilities in finland  ireland  germany and japan 
approximately employees worldwide are engaged in research and development 
in addition  the company has access to some of the world s most advanced papermaking and paper coating pilot facilities 
patents and trademarks the company owns or has the right to use approximately patents and approximately trademarks related to its business 
the company believes that its rights under its existing patents  patent applications and trademarks are of value to its operations  but no one patent  application or trademark is material to the conduct of the company s business as a whole 
insurance the company maintains liability and property insurance and insurance for business interruption in the event of damage to its production facilities and certain other insurance covering risks associated with its business 
the company believes such insurance is adequate for the operation of its business 
there is no assurance that in the future the company will be able to maintain the coverage currently in place or that the premiums therefore will not increase substantially

cautionary factors that may affect future results the disclosure and analysis set forth in this report contains certain forward looking statements  particularly statements relating to future actions  future performance or result of current and anticipated products  sales efforts  expenditures  and financial results 
from time to time  the company also provides forward looking statements in other publicly released materials  both written and oral 
forward looking statements provide current expectations and forecasts of future events such as new products  revenues and financial performance  and are not limited to describing historical or current facts 
they can be identified by the use of words such as expects  plans  anticipates  and other words and phrases of similar meaning 
forward looking statements are necessarily based on assumptions  estimates and limited information available at the time they are made 
a broad variety of risks and uncertainties  both known and unknown  as well as the inaccuracy of assumptions and estimates  can affect the realization of the expectations or forecasts in these statements 
consequently  no forward looking statement can be guaranteed 
actual future results may vary materially 
the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statements 
investors should refer to the company s subsequent filings under the securities exchange act of for further disclosures 
as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of  the company is providing the following cautionary statements which identify factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from historical and expected results 
it is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors 
investors should not consider this list an exhaustive statement of all risks  uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions 
historical growth rate continuance of the historical growth rate of the company depends upon a number of uncertain events  including the outcome of the company s strategies of increasing its penetration into geographic markets such as asia and europe  increasing its penetration into product markets such as the market for paper coating pigments and the market for groundwood paper pigments  increasing sales to existing pcc customers by increasing the amount of pcc used per ton of paper produced  and developing  introducing and selling new products and acquisitions 
difficulties  delays or failure of any of these strategies could cause the future growth rate of the company to differ materially from its historical growth rate 
contract renewals the company s sales of pcc are predominantly pursuant to long term agreements  generally ten years in length  with paper mills at which the company operates satellite pcc plants 
the terms of many of these agreements have been extended  often in connection with an expansion of the satellite plant 
failure of a number of the company s customers to renew existing agreements on terms as favorable to the company as those currently in effect could cause the future growth rate of the company to differ materially from its historical growth rate  could have a substantial adverse effect on the company s results of operations  and could also result in impairment of the assets associated with the pcc plant 
consolidation in customer industries  principally paper and steel several consolidations in the paper industry have taken place in recent years 
these consolidations could result in partial or total closure of some paper mills at which the company operates pcc satellites 
such closures would reduce the company s sales of pcc  except to the extent that they resulted in shifting paper production and associated purchases of pcc to another location served by the company 
there can be no assurance  however  that this will occur 
in addition  such consolidations concentrate purchasing power in the hands of a smaller number of papermakers  enabling them to increase pressure on suppliers  such as the company 
this increased pressure could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations in the future 
litigation  environmental exposures the company s operations are subject to international  federal  state and local governmental  tax and other laws and regulations  and potentially to claims for various legal  environmental and tax matters 
the company is currently a party to various litigation matters 
while the company carries liability insurance which it believes to be appropriate to its businesses  and has provided reserves for such matters which it believes to be adequate  an unanticipated liability arising out of such a litigation matter or a tax or environmental proceeding could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  future events  such as changes in or modifications or interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement polices or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of certain products may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on the company 
new products the company is engaged in a continuous effort to develop new products and processes in all of its product lines 
difficulties  delays or failures in the development  testing  production  marketing or sale of such new products could cause actual results of operations to differ materially from our expected results 
competition  protection of intellectual property particularly in its pcc and refractory product lines  the company s ability to compete is based in part upon proprietary knowledge  both patented and unpatented 
the company s ability to achieve anticipated results depends in part on its ability to defend its intellectual property against inappropriate disclosure as well as against infringement 
in addition  development by the company s competitors of new products or technologies that are more effective or less expensive than those the company offers could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
risks of doing business abroad as the company expands its operations overseas  it faces the increased risks of doing business abroad  including inflation  fluctuation in interest rates and currency exchange rates  changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements  export and import restrictions  tariffs  nationalization  expropriation  limits on repatriation of funds  civil unrest  terrorism  unstable governments and legal systems  and other factors 
adverse developments in any of these areas could cause actual results to differ materially from historical and expected results 
availability of raw materials the company s ability to achieve anticipated results depends in part on having an adequate supply of raw materials for its manufacturing operations  particularly lime and carbon dioxide for the pcc product line  magnesia for refractory operations and talc ore for the processed minerals product line  and on having adequate access to the ore reserves at its mining operations 
unanticipated changes in the costs or availability of such raw materials  or in the company s ability to have access to its ore reserves  could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
cyclical nature of customers businesses the majority of the company s sales are to customers in two industries  paper manufacturing and steel manufacturing  which have historically been cyclical 
the company s exposure to variations in its customers businesses has been reduced in recent years by the growth in the number of plants its operates  by the diversification of its portfolio of products and services  and by its geographic expansion 
also  the company has structured some of its long term satellite pcc contracts to provide a degree of protection against declines in the quantity of product purchased  since the price per ton of pcc generally rises as the number of tons purchased declines 
in addition  many of the company s product lines lower its customers costs of production or increases their productivity  which should encourage them to use its products 
however  a sustained economic downturn in one or more of the industries or geographic regions that the company serves  or in the worldwide economy  could cause actual results of operations to differ materially from historical and expected results

item legal proceedings on june   the company filed suit against switzerland based omya ag for patent infringement seeking injunctive relief and damages in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
the suit alleges that omya and its subsidiaries have infringed  are inducing the infringement of  or are contributing to the infringement of two patents held by the company covering the use of calcium carbonate in the manufacture of acidic paper 
the company s technology is commonly referred to as acid tolerant technology and is commercialized by its wholly owned subsidiary  specialty minerals inc  through its at precipitated calcium carbonate 
minerals technologies argues that its business has been  and continues to be  damaged by this alleged infringement 
on december  and january   two subsidiaries of omya ag filed a lawsuit against the company in the specialized section for industrial law of the court of turin in turin  italy  seeking a declaratory judgment that they have not committed acts of unfair competition against the company and that two of the company s european patents are invalid and not infringed by certain omya calcium carbonate products 
one of the two european patents in this case is the counterpart of the two united states patents at issue in the company s june  suit described above 
this matter currently is in a preliminary stage 
as previously reported  certain of the company s subsidiaries are among numerous defendants in a number of cases seeking damages for exposure to silica or to asbestos containing materials 
most of these claims do not provide adequate information to assess their merits  the likelihood that the company will be found liable  or the magnitude of such liability if any 
additional claims of this nature may be made against the company or its subsidiaries 
at this time management anticipates that the amount of the company s liability  if any  and the cost of defending such claims  will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
environmental matters as previously reported  on april   the connecticut department of environmental protection dep issued an administrative consent order relating to our canaan  connecticut plant where both our refractories segment and specialty minerals segment have operations 
we agreed to the order which includes provisions requiring investigation and remediation of contamination associated with historic use of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs at a portion of the site 
the following is the present status of the remediation efforts building decontamination 
we have completed the investigation of building contamination and submitted a report characterizing the contamination 
we are awaiting review and approval of this report by the regulators 
based on the results of this investigation  we believe that the contamination may be adequately addressed by means of encapsulation through painting of exposed surfaces  pursuant to epa s regulations and have accrued such liabilities as discussed below 
however  this conclusion remains uncertain pending completion of the phased remediation decision process required by the regulations 
groundwater 
we are still conducting investigations of potential groundwater contamination 
to date  the results of investigation indicate that there is some oil contamination of the groundwater 
we are conducting further investigations of the groundwater 
soil 
we have completed the investigation of soil contamination and submitted a report characterizing contamination to the regulators 
based on the results of this investigation  we believe that the contamination may be left in place and monitored  pursuant to a site specific risk assessment  which is underway 
however  this conclusion is subject to completion of a phased remediation decision process required by applicable regulations 
we believe that the most likely form of remediation will be to leave existing contamination in place  encapsulate it  and monitor the effectiveness of the encapsulation 
we estimate that the cost of the likely remediation above would approximate  and that amount has been recorded as a liability on our books and records 
the company is evaluating options for upgrading the wastewater treatment facilities at its adams  massachusetts  plant 
this work is being undertaken pursuant to an administrative consent order issued by the massachusetts department of environmental protection on june  the order required payment of a civil fine in the amount of eighteen thousand five hundred dollars  the investigation of options for ensuring that the facility s wastewater treatment ponds will not result in discharge to groundwater  and closure of a historic lime solids disposal area 
the company is committed to identifying appropriate improvements to the wastewater treatment system by  and to implementing the improvements by june  preliminary engineering reviews indicate that the estimated cost of these upgrades to operate this facility beyond may be between million to million 
the company estimates that remediation costs would approximate  which has been accrued as of december  the company and its subsidiaries are not party to any other material pending legal proceedings  other than routine litigation incidental to their businesses

the adverse economic environment of the past several years has had severe effects on the paper industry  by far our largest customer group  as paper mills have closed or taken significant downtime and the industry has consolidated 
the effect on the steel industry has been even more dramatic  with several large steel makers declaring bankruptcy 
although the overall economy began to improve in late and early  the paper and steel industries had been slow to participate in the recovery  while maintaining pricing pressure on their suppliers 
for most of  we experienced improved conditions  particularly in the steel industry and construction industry in north america

net income grew to million from million in the comparison of our operating income and net income in the past three years has been affected by a number of factors in  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to a satellite pcc plant at a paper mill which was permanently shut down  we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  in the first quarter of  which resulted in a charge to earnings of about million  net of tax and annual ongoing costs of approximately per share  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded charges relating to reduction of approximately in our worldwide workforce  the planned closure of the facility at river rouge  michigan  which we acquired in as part of the refractory business of martin marietta materials  and the retirement of some synsil products manufacturing assets  which had been made obsolete by improvements in the production process 
the total effect was to reduce pretax income by about million 
we recorded additional restructuring costs of million in in relation to the workforce reduction program that began in the fourth quarter of we recognized a million pre tax corporate charge in the fourth quarter of related to due diligence for a terminated acquisition effort 
we face some significant risks and challenges in the future our success depends in part on the performance of the industries we serve  particularly papermaking and steelmaking 
some of our customers may continue to face a difficult business environment  and may experience further shutdowns 
the recent wave of consolidations in the paper and steel industries concentrates purchasing power in the hands of fewer customers  increasing pricing pressure on suppliers such as mti  most of our pcc sales are under long term contracts with paper companies at whose mills we operate satellite pcc plants  when they reach their expiration dates these contracts may not be renewed  or may be renewed on terms less favorable to us  the cost of employee benefits  particularly health insurance  has risen significantly in recent years and continues to do so  we are experiencing increased cost of magnesia and talc imported from china  including higher shipping costs and higher other raw material costs in both segments  we are also experiencing increased energy costs in both our business segments  although the synsil products family has received favorable reactions from potential customers and we have signed two supply contracts  this product line is not yet profitable and its commercial viability cannot be assured  and as we expand our operations abroad we face the inherent risks of doing business in many foreign countries  including foreign exchange risk  import and export restrictions  and security concerns 
despite these difficulties  we are optimistic about the opportunities for continued growth that are open to us  including increasing our sales pcc for paper by further penetration of the markets for paper filling at both free sheet and groundwood mills  increasing our sales of pcc for paper coating  particularly from the coating pcc facility in walsum  germany  continuing research and development activities for new products  in particular our joint project with international paper to develop and implement a filler fiber composite technology  achieving market acceptance of the synsil products family of composite minerals for the glass industry  continuing our penetration in both business segments into china  including the start up of two four unit satellite pcc plants through our joint venture with asia pulp paper china pte 
ltd 
app china  and our new facility for the refractories segment  increase market penetration in the refractories segment through higher value specialty products and application systems 
however  there can be no assurance that we will achieve success in implementing any one or more of these opportunities

foreign exchange had a favorable impact on sales of approximately million or percentage points of growth 
sales in the specialty minerals segment  which includes the pcc and processed minerals product lines  increased to million compared with million for the same period in sales in the refractories segment grew over the previous year to million 
in  worldwide net sales increased to million from million in the prior year 
specialty minerals segment sales increased approximately and refractories segment sales increased approximately in worldwide net sales of pcc  which is primarily used in the manufacturing process of the paper industry  increased to million from million in the prior year 
worldwide net sales of paper pcc increased to million from million in the prior year 
paper pcc volumes grew for the full year with volumes in excess of million tons 
in  worldwide printing and writing paper production increased over  and demand for uncoated freesheet  our largest market for pcc  increased slightly in sales growth was achieved in all regions 
excluding the effect of foreign currency  european sales grew 
this was due to an overall increase in production of printing and writing papers in that region 
asia reported growth  excluding the effect of foreign currency  primarily due to our new satellite facility in malaysia 
north america also performed strongly with growth aided by the restart of our millinocket  maine  satellite facility which has been idle since december sales of specialty pcc grew to million from million in this growth was primarily attributable to improved volumes  especially in automotive and consumer applications 
pcc sales in increased to million from million in the prior year 
in  united states printing and writing paper shipments were down percent  and demand for uncoated freesheet  our largest market for pcc was down percent  compared with sales of pcc for paper were adversely affected by these decreases in production 
the implementation of the international paper agreements also had a negative impact on sales 
however  the favorable effect of foreign exchange more than offset these factors 
net sales of processed minerals products in increased to million from million in the growth in this product line was attributed to the continued strength of the residential construction market and the company s increased penetration in the building products and plastics industries 
processed minerals net sales in increased to million from million in this increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of polar minerals inc full year sales in  excluding polar minerals increased approximately due to strong demand from the residential construction related industries and from new polymer and health care applications for our talc products 
net sales in the refractories segment in increased to million from million in the prior year 
the favorable impact of foreign exchange was approximately percentage points of the sales growth 
this underlying growth was primarily attributable to both improved performance and better steel industry conditions in north america  our largest market  where sales grew over the prior year 
steel production in the united states increased in net sales in the refractories segment in increased to million from million in the prior year 
the increase in sales for the refractories segment in was primarily attributable to increased sales of equipment and application systems in europe  and the favorable impact of foreign exchange 
net sales in the united states was million in  approximately higher than in the prior year 
international sales in increased 
foreign exchange had a impact on sales growth 
in  domestic net sales were higher than the prior year and international sales were greater than in the prior year primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange 
operating costs and expenses dollars in millions growth growth cost of goods sold marketing and administrative research and development bad debt expenses acquisition termination costs restructuring charges write down of impaired assets percentage not meaningful cost of goods sold in was of sales compared with in the prior year 
our cost of goods sold grew which had an unfavorable leveraging impact on our sales growth resulting in an increase in production margin 
this unfavorable leveraging occurred in both reporting segments 
in the specialty minerals segment  production margins were affected by higher raw material costs  energy costs and start up costs for our new plant in walsum  germany 
in the refractories segment  the production margin was impacted by the higher cost of magnesia and other raw materials and increased energy costs 
in  cost of goods sold was of sales compared with in our production margin increased at approximately the same rate as sales 
in the specialty minerals segment  production margins increased despite a sales growth 
margins in this segment were affected by the shutdown of the millinocket satellite pcc plant  continuing development costs in the coating pcc program  the effect of the revisions to the ip contracts  and weakness in the specialty pcc product line 
in the refractories segment  production margins increased  almost double the sales growth 
this was due to an improved product mix  increased product and equipment system sales  and improved manufacturing operations 
marketing and administrative costs increased in to million and represented of net sales from of net sales in both segments increased marketing expenses to support worldwide business development efforts 
the company also experienced higher litigation costs to protect our intellectual property as well as higher corporate expenses associated with the sarbanes oxley section implementation 
in  marketing and administrative costs increased to million and increased to of net sales from of net sales in research and development expenses increased to million and represented of net sales due to increased product development activities in both segments  but particularly in the pcc product line as we continue our commitment to the filler fibre composite mineral program and coating trial activities 
in  research and development expenses increased and represented of sales 
we recorded bad debt expenses of million and million in and  respectively 
in  the provision for bad debt was net of recoveries of approximately million related to steel company bankruptcies  in which we had previously written off the related accounts receivable 
in  these charges were primarily related to additional provisions and associated with potential risks to our customers in the steel  paper and other industries and several customer bankruptcy filings 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recognized million in pre tax corporate charges related to due diligence costs from a terminated acquisition effort 
during the fourth quarter of  we restructured our operations to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency 
this resulted in a restructuring charge of million 
as part of this restructuring program  we recorded million in additional charges in the restructuring charges relate to workforce reductions from all business units throughout our worldwide operations and the termination of certain leases 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a write down of impaired assets of million 
the impairment charges were related to the closure of our operations in river rouge  michigan  in and the retirement of certain synsil products assets that have been made obsolete 
income from operations dollars in millions growth growth income from operations income from operations in increased to million from million in income from operations was of sales as compared with of sales in income from operations in decreased to million from million in income from operations decreased to of sales as compared with of sales in this decrease was primarily due to the aforementioned restructuring and impairment costs 
income from operations for the specialty minerals segment increased to million and was of its net sales 
unfavorable leveraging to operating income for this segment was primarily due to the impact of higher raw material and energy costs  new plant start up costs  and higher litigation and other expenses 
operating income for the refractories segment increased to million and was of its net sales 
the improvement in operating income was due to an improved product mix  increased equipment sales  and more efficient manufacturing operations 
in  income from operations for the specialty minerals segment decreased to million and was of its net sales 
the margins of this segment were affected by the ip agreement and the millinocket temporary shutdown 
operating income for the refractories segment increased to million and was of its net sales 
non operating deductions dollars in millions growth growth non operating deductions  net non operating deductions decreased from the prior year 
this decrease was primarily due to lower interest expense 
provision for taxes on income dollars in millions growth growth provision for taxes on income the effective tax rate increased to in compared with in the effective tax rate for was lower than primarily do to a contribution of intellectual property 
minority interests dollars in millions growth growth minority interests the consolidated joint ventures continue to operate profitably and at approximately the same level as prior years 
net income dollars in millions growth growth net income income before the cumulative effect of an accounting change increased to million from million in diluted earnings per common share before the cumulative effect of the accounting change increased to compared with in effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
establishes the financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we recorded a non cash  after tax charge to earnings of approximately million for the cumulative effect of this accounting change related to retirement obligations associated with our pcc satellite facilities and mining properties  both within the specialty minerals segment 
net income increased in to million 
earnings per common share  on a diluted basis  increased to in as compared with in the prior year 
outlook in  after some years of difficulty  mti experienced a favorable economic environment 
consumer confidence  retail spending and housing starts strengthened in and we saw an upward trend in the two major industries we serve papermaking and steel 
the global demand for printing and writing paper increased as did worldwide steel production 
as a result  during we were able to significantly increase our sales growth 
however  we continue to be affected by significantly higher raw material and energy costs 
in  we plan to continue our focus on the following growth strategies expand regionally with the markets we serve 
increase market penetration of pcc in paper filling at both free sheet and groundwood mills 
increase penetration of pcc into the paper coating market 
emphasize higher value specialty products and application systems to increase market penetration in the refractories segment 
continue research and development and marketing efforts for new and existing products  including market acceptance for the synsil products family of composite minerals 
continue to improve our cost competitiveness 
continue selective acquisitions to complement our existing businesses 
however  there can be no assurances that we will achieve success in implementing any one or more of these strategies 
the following are notable events that may impact our performance in  we began the construction of two new pcc plants at two app china paper mills in the republic of china 
they will be located at app paper mills in dagang and suzhou 
they are expected to be operational in the first half of and will add a total capacity of units  or  approximately  tons of coating and filling pcc pigments 
in  we completed construction and began commissioning of our merchant paper coating pcc facility in walsum  germany 
in  we expect sales volumes to increase  particularly in the second half of in we had agreements to expand four of our existing satellite facilities 
the ramp up of these facilities is expected to add approximately units of additional capacity  with a unit of capacity representing between  to  tons 
also  we accelerated our efforts under the cooperative development and licensing agreement with ip to develop and commercialize filler fiber composite materials which are capable of raising pcc filler levels 
after several years of synsil development  the company sees the potential of this innovation to become a growing business for mti 
in  the refractories segment began construction of a  ton capacity refractory manufacturing facility in china 
we expect this plant to come on line in the fourth quarter of it will allow this segment to effectively serve china  which has become one of the largest and fastest growing steel markets in the world 
as we continue to expand our operations overseas  we face the inherent risks of doing business abroad  including inflation  fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates  changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements  export and import restrictions  tariffs  nationalization  expropriation  limits on repatriation of funds  civil unrest  terrorism  unstable governments and legal systems and other factors 
some of our operations are located in areas that have experienced political or economic instability  including indonesia  israel  brazil  thailand  china and south africa 
in addition  our performance depends to some extent on that of the industries we serve  particularly the paper manufacturing  steel manufacturing  and construction industries 
our sales of pcc are predominately pursuant to long term contracts  initially ten years in length  with paper companies at whose mills we operate satellite pcc plants 
the terms of many of these agreements have been extended  often in connection with an expansion of the satellite pcc plant 
failure of a number of our customers to renew existing agreements on terms as favorable to us as those currently in effect could cause our future growth rate to differ materially from our historical growth rate  and could also result in impairment of the assets associated with the pcc plant 
there are presently three satellite locations at which the initial term of the contract with the host mills have expired 
we continue to supply pcc at both of these locations 
we hope to reach agreement on a long term extension of the contract  however  there can be no assurance that these negotiations will be successful 
we have a consolidated interest in four joint venture companies at paper mills owned by subsidiaries of asia pulp paper company ltd 
app and app china 
app is a multinational pulp and paper company whose current financial difficulties have been widely publicized 
while app is negotiating with its creditors  the facilities have remained in operation at levels consistent with the prior year 
the mills are continuing to use our pcc and to satisfy their obligations to the joint ventures 
however  there can be no assurance that our operations at these paper mills will not be adversely affected by app s financial difficulties in the future 
our net investment in these satellite plants was approximately million at december  liquidity and capital resources cash flows in were provided from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises 
the cash was applied principally to fund million of capital expenditures and million for purchases of common shares for treasury 
cash provided from operating activities amounted to million in as compared with million in included in cash flow from operations was pension plan funding of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect to utilize our cash reserves to support the aforementioned growth strategies 
on february   the board authorized our management committee to repurchase  at its discretion  up to million in additional shares per year over the following three years 
as of december   we had repurchased approximately  shares under this program at an average price of approximately per share 
on october   our board of directors authorized our management committee  at its discretion  to repurchase up to million in additional shares over the next three year period 
as of december   the company had purchased  shares under this program at an average price of per share 
on january   our board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend on our common stock of per share 
no dividend will be payable unless declared by the board and unless funds are legally available for payment thereof 
we have million in uncommitted short term bank credit lines  of which million was in use in december  we anticipate that capital expenditures for should approximate million  principally related to the construction of pcc plants and other opportunities that meet our strategic growth objectives 
we expect to meet our long term financing requirements from internally generated funds  uncommitted bank credit lines and  where appropriate  project financing of certain satellite plants 
the aggregate maturities of long term debt are as follows million  million  million  million  million  thereafter million 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of inventories  valuation of long term assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  pension plan assumptions  income taxes  income tax valuation allowances and litigation and environmental liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that can not readily be determined from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenue from sale of products is recognized at the time the goods are shipped and title passes to the customer 
in most of our pcc contracts  the price per ton is based upon the total number of tons sold to the customer during the year 
under those contracts  the price billed to the customer for shipments during the year is based on periodic estimates of the total annual volume that will be sold to the customer 
revenues are adjusted at the end of each year to reflect the actual volume sold 
revenues from sales of equipment are recorded upon completion of installation and receipt of customer acceptance 
revenues from services are recorded when the services are performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts substantially all of our accounts receivable are due from companies in the paper  construction and steel industries 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
such allowance is established through a charge to the provision for bad debt expenses 
we recorded bad debt expenses of million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the million provision in was net of million of bad debt recoveries related to steel customer bankruptcies for previously written off accounts receivable 
the charges in and were much higher than historical levels and were primarily related to bankruptcy filings by some of our customers in the paper and steel industries and to additional provisions associated with risks in the paper  steel and other industries 
in addition to specific allowances established for bankrupt customers  we also analyze the collection history and financial condition of our other customers considering current industry conditions and determine whether an allowance needs to be established or adjusted 
property  plant and equipment  goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets property  plant and equipment are depreciated over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets can generate revenue  which does not necessarily coincide with the remaining term of a customer s contractual obligation to purchase products made using those assets 
our sales of pcc are predominately pursuant to long term contracts  initially ten years in length  with paper mills at which we operate satellite pcc plants 
the terms of many of these agreements have been extended  often in connection with an expansion of the satellite pcc plant 
we also continue to supply pcc at three locations at which the pcc contract has expired 
failure of a pcc customer to renew an agreement or continue to purchase pcc from our facility could result in an impairment of assets or accelerated depreciation at such facility 
in the third quarter of  we reduced the useful lives of satellite pcc plants at international paper company s ip mills due to an increased risk that some or all of these pcc contracts would not be renewed 
as a result of this change  we also reviewed the useful lives of the assets at our remaining satellite pcc facilities and other plants 
during the first quarter of  we revised the estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment pertaining to our natural stone mining and processing plants and chemical processing plants from years to years 
we also reduced the estimated useful lives of certain software related assets due to implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning system 
during the second quarter of  we reached an agreement with ip that extended eight pcc supply contracts and therefore extended the useful lives of the satellite pcc plants at those ip mills 
the net effect of the changes in estimated useful lives  including the deceleration of depreciation at the ip plants  was an increase to diluted earnings per share of approximately in valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets we assess the possible impairment of long lived assets and identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment by our ability to recover the carrying amount of the assets from expected future operating cash flow on a discounted basis 
net intangible assets  long lived assets  and goodwill amounted to million as of december  accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of income 
pension benefits we sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering the majority of its employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors which attempt to estimate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by us  within certain guidelines 
our assumptions reflect our historical experience and management s best judgment regarding future expectations 
in addition  our actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these factors 
the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants  among other things 
differences from these assumptions may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense liability recorded by us 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k  beginning on page f this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
prospective information and factors that may affect future results the securities and exchange commission encourages companies to disclose forward looking information so that investors can better understand companies future prospects and make informed investment decisions 
this report may contain forward looking statements that set our anticipated results based on management s plans and assumptions 
words such as expects  plans  anticipates  and words and terms of similar substance  used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify these forward looking statements 
we cannot guarantee that the outcomes suggested in any forward looking statement will be realized  although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions 
achievement of future results is subject to risks  uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions 
should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate  actual results could vary materially from those anticipated  estimated or projected 
investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward looking statements and should refer to the discussion of certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions under the heading cautionary factors that may affect future results in item inflation historically  inflation has not had a material adverse effect on us 
the contracts pursuant to which we construct and operate our satellite pcc plants generally adjust pricing to reflect increases in costs resulting from inflation 
cyclical nature of customers businesses the bulk of our sales are to customers in the paper manufacturing  steel manufacturing and construction industries  which have historically been cyclical 
the pricing structure of some of our long term pcc contracts makes our pcc business less sensitive to declines in the quantity of product purchased 
however  we cannot predict the economic outlook in the countries in which we do business  nor in the key industries we serve 
there can be no assurance that a recession  in some markets or worldwide  would not have a significant negative effect on our financial position or results of operations 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this statement is a revision to sfas no 
and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
this statement requires a public entity to expense the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments 
this statement also provides guidance on valuing and expensing these awards  as well as disclosure requirements of these equity arrangements 
this statement is effective for the first interim reporting period that begins after june  as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  we generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  valuation of employee stock options under sfas no 
r is similar to sfas no 
 with minor exceptions 
for information about what our reported results of operations and earnings per share would have been had we adopted sfas no 
 please see the discussion under the heading  stock based compensation in note to our consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
due to timing of the release of sfas no 
r  we have not yet completed the analysis of the ultimate impact that this new pronouncement will have on the results of operations  nor the method of adoption for this new standard 
in december  fasb issued statement no 
 exchanges of non monetary assets an amendment to apb opinion no 
this statement amends the guidance in opinion no 
to eliminate the exception for non monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of non monetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a non monetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the company had no such exchanges in in november  fasb issued statement no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this statement amends the guidance in arb no  chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
this statement requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement will be effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of  which provides relief concerning the timing of the sfas no 
requirement to accrue deferred taxes for unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
the fasb determined that the provisions of the act were sufficiently complex and ambiguous that companies may not be in a position to determine the impact of the act on their plans for repatriation or reinvestment of foreign earnings or the corresponding deferred tax liability 
accrual of any deferred tax liability is not required until companies have the information necessary to determine the amount of earnings to be repatriated and a reasonable estimate can be made of the deferred tax liability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar 
we do not anticipate that near term changes in exchange rates will have a material impact on our future earnings or cash flows 
however  there can be no assurance that a sudden and significant decline in the value of foreign currencies would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
approximately of our bank debt bear interest at variable rates  therefore our results of operations would only be affected by interest rate changes to such bank debt outstanding 
an immediate percent change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our results of operations over the next fiscal year 
we are exposed to various market risks  including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
when appropriate  we enter into derivative financial instruments  such as forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps  to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on our operating results 
the counterparties are major financial institutions 
such forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps would not subject us to additional risk from exchange rate or interest rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts would offset losses and gains on the assets  liabilities  and transactions being hedged 
we have open forward exchange contracts to purchase approximately million and million of foreign currencies as of december  and  respectively 
these contracts mature between january and june of the fair value of these instruments at december  was a liability of million and an asset of million at december  we entered into three year interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of million which expired in january these agreements effectively converted a portion of our floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis 
the fair value of these instruments was a liability of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively
