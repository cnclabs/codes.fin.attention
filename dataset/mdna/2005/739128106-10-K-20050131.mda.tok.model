item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
in the course of operations  we are subject to certain risk factors  including but not limited to competition and competitive pressures  sensitivity to general economic and industry conditions  international political and economic risks  availability and price of raw materials and execution of business strategy 
any forward looking statements made by or on our behalf are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of readers are cautioned that such forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties in that the actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the effects of the restatement discussed in note o of the notes to consolidated financial statements have been reflected in the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we have continued to experience a significant reduction in market demand for our products 
the difficult market conditions that existed in fiscal have continued through fiscal additionally  market price levels have deteriorated as competition for available business volume intensified 
however  we have been able to expand revenues related to system modification and equipment replacement as customers look for ways to extend the lives of their existing systems 
although we currently face reduced demand and prices  there are indications of improvement in our principal markets 
historically  business expansion within our principal markets public and private utilities  heavy industry and public agencies have lagged general economic trends by six to twelve months as our revenues are principally driven by new capital investments 
one of the positive trends we have experienced is an increase in new order activity 
orders received during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal totaled million and million  respectively  versus million and million in the same periods a year ago 
we are optimistic that we will see further improvement in fiscal in anticipation of improving business opportunities  we are taking advantage of lower production volumes to make necessary capital improvements to our manufacturing facility in houston  texas 
we have committed to capital improvement projects totaling million 
these projects include a new metal finishing and paint system and replacement of some older metal fabricating equipment with a laser cut fabricating center and material handling system 
consistent with other lean initiatives  these investments will improve our quality and efficiency as well as lead to lower working capital requirements 
these projects are scheduled to be completed in march we also expect international business opportunities to strengthen 
to enhance our ability to serve the oil and gas and petrochemical industries  we increased our interest in powell industries asia private limited pia from to on august  since that time  these operations have been fully consolidated in our financial statements 
pia was formed in as a joint venture between powell and rotary engineering limited  singapore rotary 
we anticipate the business opportunities to increase and  with increased support from our domestic operations  we should be able to improve our ability to support the development of oil and gas production in southeast asia 
to reduce overhead costs and improve efficiency  we initiated a consolidation plan that will reduce the number of facilities within our electrical power products segment 
during  we consolidated our greenville  texas and north canton  ohio operations  closing the greenville facility as of june  we consolidated our elyria  ohio and northlake  illinois operations  closing the elyria facility as of october  and in september  we announced plans to consolidate our watsonville  california and houston  texas operations  exiting the leased watsonville facility by december  total pre tax expenses associated with these plant closings are estimated to be approximately million 
in fiscal  we incurred pre tax expenses associated with the plant closings of million 
for additional information related to consolidation costs  see note m of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations year ended october  compared with year ended october  revenue and gross profit consolidated revenues decreased to million in fiscal compared to fiscal year revenues of million 
domestic revenues decreased million to million in compared to revenues outside of the united states accounted for of consolidated revenues in fiscal compared to in electrical power products our electrical power products segment recorded revenues of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal customers have been reluctant to commit to new capital construction projects throughout fiscal due to economic uncertainty 
however  we have been able to expand revenues related to system modification and equipment replacement as customers look for ways to extend the lives of their existing systems 
overall  we have experienced a decline in revenues in each of our major markets 
revenues from industrial customers were million in compared to million in utility revenues were million in compared to million in municipal and transit projects generated revenues of million compared to million a year ago 
gross profit  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal fiscal costs of goods sold included one time expenses of million to consolidate our operations 
consolidation expenses include employee severance  training and equipment relocation costs 
inflationary pressures  primarily due to higher commodity prices in copper  aluminum and steel increased direct material expenses by approximately  or million  compared to fiscal both revenue and gross profit have been adversely impacted by competitive pricing in a depressed marketplace 
partially offsetting adverse market conditions have been the results of our efforts to reduce our production overhead costs by improving operating efficiencies through the implementation of lean initiatives 
process control systems revenues in our process control systems segment increased to million compared to million in fiscal the increase in revenue is primarily attributed to our contract to design and build intelligent transportation systems its for the holland and lincoln tunnels for the port authority of new york and new jersey 
this contract accounted for million of segment revenues in fiscal and million in fiscal as of october   the remaining value associated with this project in our backlog was million  or of segment backlog  which is expected to be recognized as revenue in export revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal segment gross profit  as a percentage of revenues  was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal year gross profits as a percentage of revenues were reduced in due to the large amount of subcontract work and material pass through purchases on the holland and lincoln tunnels contract which typically will generate significantly lower profits compared to our other professional services 
for additional information related to our business segments  see note l of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
consolidated operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of revenues  in fiscal compared to million  or of revenues  in fiscal in fiscal  accounting and auditing fees increased million compared to  primarily attributable to sarbanes oxley compliance efforts 
one time consolidation expenses of million were incurred in fiscal these expenses were costs associated with actions to consolidate our operations and close certain facilities which represented excess capacity 
the benefit of lower operating overheads should be realized beginning in excluding the impact of these increases  selling  general and administrative expenses would have decreased consistent with revenues 
research and development expenditures were million in compared to million in fiscal our research efforts are directed toward the discovery and development of new products and processes as well as improvements in existing products and processes 
research and development costs are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
interest income and expense we incurred million in interest expense in fiscal compared to million in fiscal interest expense has been reduced by favorable interest rates and decreasing balances on our industrial revenue bond debt 
our industrial revenue bonds have scheduled payments of million that become due each year in october 
additionally  in fiscal  we incurred million in interest expense on our term loan and the associated interest rate swap 
in september  we paid the remaining principal balance on our term loan  which has reduced our interest expense 
we earned million in interest income in fiscal compared to million in the previous year 
interest income increased primarily due to higher levels of invested funds 
provision for income taxes our income tax provision benefit for fiscal and was million and million  and our effective tax rate was and  respectively 
during  we recorded several non recurring tax adjustments related to the following items a a million benefit was recorded primarily for the benefit of revised extraterritorial income exclusion amounts for the years ended and this benefit was derived by calculating the extraterritorial income exclusion amount on a transaction by transaction basis in  as opposed to an aggregate basis as originally estimated  b a million valuation allowance related to capital losses was released in we entered into an agreement in to sell a capital asset that will trigger enough capital gain to utilize the capital loss carryforward  and c we released million of state income tax reserve in due to acceptance by certain state taxing authorities of voluntary disclosure agreements in without these adjustments  our effective tax rate would have been 
net income net income was million  or per diluted share  in fiscal year compared to million  or per diluted share  in fiscal year the decrease in net income primarily relates to lower business volume and decreased gross profits in fiscal gross profits declined as a result of one time consolidation costs  inflationary pressures on materials costs  and depressed market price levels 
partially offsetting lower gross profits were higher interest income and a net income tax benefit 
in fiscal  net income was negatively impacted as a result of our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded a goodwill impairment loss of million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the goodwill impairment charge accounted for a loss of per diluted share a year ago 
year ended october  compared with year ended october  revenue and gross profit consolidated revenues decreased to million in fiscal as compared to fiscal year revenues of million 
domestic revenues decreased million to million in compared to despite weaknesses in domestic markets  new investments in oil and gas production facilities contributed to increased international revenues in fiscal revenues outside of the united states accounted for of consolidated revenues in compared to in electrical power products our electrical power products segment recorded revenues in fiscal of million compared to million in fiscal revenues from public and private utilities fell by in fiscal in particular  there was a significant decline in new investments in electrical power generation facilities 
utility revenues were million in compared to a record million in our municipal customers faced a reduced tax base with which to fund infrastructure projects in municipal and transit projects generated revenues of million compared to million in however  revenues from industrial customers totaled million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  over this increase in revenue from industrial customers resulted primarily from revenues related to the manufacture and delivery of power control modules for new oil and gas production facilities 
these long term projects to construct new oil and gas production facilities were initiated by our customers during and gross profit  as a percentage of revenues  was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal year gross profit has been adversely impacted by lower production volumes and competitive pricing pressures 
partially offsetting adverse market conditions were the results of our efforts to reduce our costs of production by improving operating efficiencies through the implementation of lean initiatives 
in addition  we incurred an impairment loss of million to decrease the carrying value of machinery and equipment to their estimated market value 
this impairment loss resulted from our decision to discontinue certain product lines 
these product lines generated aggregate revenues of less than million in fiscal process control systems revenues in our process control systems segment increased to million compared to million in fiscal our most significant award during was a contract to design and build intelligent transportation systems its for the holland and lincoln tunnels from the port authority of new york and new jersey valued at million as of october  revenue attributable to this project totaled million during fiscal gross profit  as a percentage of revenues  was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal year for additional information related to our business segments  see note l of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
consolidated operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to of revenues in fiscal compared to of revenues in fiscal year our commitment to continue to develop our customer markets and products resulted in an increase in operating expenses relative to our revenues 
research and development expenditures were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal year our research efforts are directed toward the discovery and development of new products and processes as well as improvements in existing products and processes 
interest income and expense we incurred million in interest expense on our term debt and outstanding industrial development revenue bonds during fiscal compared to million in as a result of lower levels of debt and decreased interest rates  our interest expense has declined 
interest income increased by million to million in compared to the same period of the previous year 
an increase in invested funds during has been partially offset by the lower interest rate environment 
provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes of in fiscal compared to in fiscal included in our provision is million for state taxes net of federal tax benefit of which million reflects revised estimates in state tax exposures related to prior years 
over the past several years  our business has expanded and we are now conducting activities in more states 
we have accordingly increased our estimates for such state tax exposures 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we recorded a goodwill impairment loss of million  net of million taxes  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle during the first quarter of we recorded an impairment charge of million  net of million taxes  to write off the full value of goodwill in our process control systems segment 
in our electrical power products segment  we recorded an impairment charge of million  net of approximately  taxes 
the goodwill impairment charge accounted for a loss of per diluted share 
net income net income was million  or per diluted share  in fiscal year compared to million  or per diluted share  in fiscal year the decrease in net income primarily relates to lower business volume and decreased gross profits in fiscal additionally  net income was negatively impacted as a result of an impairment loss of million  net of taxes  recorded to decrease the carrying value of machinery and equipment  an increase in estimates for state tax exposures related to prior years of million  net of federal tax benefits  and the net effect of a change in accounting principle related to goodwill accounted for million 
each of these adjustments to net income is discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources year ended october  compared with year ended october  we have continued to improve our liquidity position 
working capital was million at october  compared to million at october  as of october   current assets exceeded current liabilities by times and our debt to capitalization ratio was less than to at october   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  compared to million at october  long term debt  including current maturities  totaled million at october  compared to million at october  in addition to our long term debt  we maintain a revolving credit agreement which at year end provided for a borrowing capacity of million through february as of october  and  there were no outstanding borrowings under this line of credit 
for further information regarding our debt  see note g of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal a net reduction in operating assets and liabilities provided million with the remainder of the increase related to net earnings adjusted for depreciation  amortization and other non cash expenses 
of the million provided by the net reduction in operating assets and liabilities  million was provided due to a reduction of investments in contract costs and inventories as projects in our backlog reached contractual billing milestones 
in addition  lower sales volumes have resulted in less cash being reinvested in operating assets 
during fiscal  operating activities provided net cash of million of which million resulted from a reduction in operating assets and liabilities with the remainder of the increase related to net earnings adjusted for depreciation  amortization and other non cash expenses 
investing activities investments in property  plant and equipment during fiscal totaled million compared to million in fiscal the majority of our capital investments will be used to improve our capabilities to manufacture switchgear and electrical power control rooms 
we have committed to capital projects totaling million to acquire a new metal finishing and paint system  a laser cut fabricating center  and material handling system 
as of the end of fiscal  we have incurred costs of million for these projects 
we expect to incur the balance during the first half of consistent with other lean initiatives  these investments will improve our quality and efficiency as well as lead to lower working capital requirements 
proceeds from the sale of fixed assets provided cash of million in fiscal  primarily from the sale of our franklin park  illinois manufacturing facility which was idled in net trades in marketable securities provided cash of million in fiscal during  we purchased million of these investment grade corporate bonds and classified them as available for sale 
the maturity dates of these bonds vary from one to nine years 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal primarily from the exercise of stock options 
net cash used in financing activities in fiscal was million 
in september  we paid the remaining principal balance on our term loan 
the repayment of this loan was the primary use of cash for financing activities in fiscal year contractual obligations at october   our long term contractual obligations were limited to debt and leases 
the table below details our commitments by type of obligation and the period that the payment will become due in thousands 
as of october  payments due by period long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total less than year   to years   to years   more than years   total long term contractual obligations   we are contingently liable for secured and unsecured letters of credit of million as of october  we also had performance bonds totaling approximately million that were outstanding at october  performance bonds are used to guarantee contract performance to our customers 
year ended october  compared with year ended october  working capital was million at october  compared to million at october  as of october   current assets exceeded current liabilities by times and our debt to capitalization ratio was less than to at october   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  compared to million at october  long term debt  including current maturities  totaled million at october  compared to million at october  in addition to our long term debt  we maintain a revolving credit agreement which at year end provided for a credit facility of million through february as of october   there were no borrowings under this line of credit

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal a net reduction in operating assets and liabilities provided million with the remainder of the increase related to net earnings adjusted for depreciation  amortization and other non cash expenses 
during fiscal  operating activities provided net cash of million of which million resulted from a reduction in operating assets and liabilities 
investing activities investments in property  plant and equipment during fiscal totaled million compared to million in fiscal the majority of these expenditures were used to complete a project initiated during to increase our manufacturing capacity available for the manufacture of electrical power control modules 
these modules are provided to the oil and gas industry for use on offshore platforms 
during  we purchased million of investment grade corporate bonds 
as of october   the maturity dates of these bonds vary from five to nine years 
financing activities financing activities used million in fiscal approximately million was used for repayments on our long term debt 
other financing activities were limited primarily to the exercise of stock options 
during fiscal  net cash used by financing activities was million  primarily from payments on long term debt 
outlook for fiscal we expect our principal markets to strengthen throughout customer inquiries  or requests for proposals  have steadily strengthened during the second half of fiscal one of the positive trends we have experienced is an increase in new order activity 
orders received during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal totaled million and million  respectively  versus million and million in the same periods a year ago 
we are optimistic that we will see further improvement in fiscal in our electrical power products segment  third and fourth quarter orders increased both sequentially and year over year 
in addition  we expect to realize lower overhead expenses and increased efficiencies as a result of our consolidation efforts and capital improvements  both of which should improve our competitive position 
although our process controls systems segment continues to experience soft market conditions  we anticipate increased funding for municipal projects will be available as general economic conditions strengthen 
we believe we will be well positioned to take advantage of improving economic conditions 
we anticipate that we will begin reinvesting a portion of our cash in operating working capital in fiscal working capital needs are anticipated to increase with growing levels of business activity 
we believe that working capital  borrowing capabilities  and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to finance anticipated operational activities  capital improvements  debt repayment and possible future acquisitions for the foreseeable future 
effects of inflation and recession in  we experienced a significant deterioration in business volume due to the effects of the us economy on our markets and customers 
new investments in infrastructure projects were curtailed in both our utility and industrial market segments 
our municipal clients faced a reduced tax base with which to fund infrastructure projects 
along with indications of an improving u 
s economy  new business inquiry levels strengthened throughout the pace of orders grew stronger as progressed and we ended the year with an order rate that we have not experienced since we anticipate these conditions will continue into as the us economy began to show signs of improvement  we experienced significant price pressures with our key raw materials  primarily copper  aluminum and steel 
competitive market pressures limited our ability to pass these cost increases to our customers 
these competing pressures eroded our earnings in we anticipate these inflationary pressures will continue to adversely impact our operations in critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments with respect to the selection and application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies and estimates to be critical in the preparation and reporting of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues are generated from the engineering and manufacturing of custom products 
we recognize revenues under both the completed contract method and the percentage of completion method  depending upon the duration and the scope of the project 
at the onset of each project  the size  scope and duration of the contract is reviewed to determine the appropriate revenue recognition method based upon company policy and applicable accounting standards 
due to the long term and fixed price nature of the projects in the process control systems segment  all revenues are recorded using percentage of completion 
however  projects in the electrical power products segment vary widely  thus  both the completed contract and percentage of completion methods are used 
during the last three years  approximately to of revenues in our electrical power product s segment were recognized using the percentage of completion method 
under the completed contract method  revenues are recognized upon the transfer of title  which is generally at the time of shipment or delivery depending upon the terms of the contract  when all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we use shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  to verify the transfer of title to the customer 
we assess whether the price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
collectibility is assessed based on the creditworthiness of the customer assessed through credit verification  the customer s payment history and other relevant factors 
under the percentage of completion method  revenues are recognized as work is performed based on the estimated completion to date calculated by multiplying the total contract price by percentage of performance to date  based on total labor dollars or hours incurred to date to the total estimated labor dollars or hours estimated at completion 
application of the percentage of completion method of accounting requires the use of estimates of costs to be incurred for the performance of the contract 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  tools  repairs and all costs associated with operation of equipment excluding depreciation 
the cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of the company s engineers  project managers  and financial professionals 
factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability and productivity of labor  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the effect of change orders  the availability of materials  the effect of any delays in performance and the recoverability of any claims 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated profitability and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and their effects are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
whenever revisions of estimated contract costs and contract values indicate that the contract costs will exceed estimated revenues  thus creating a loss  a provision for the total estimated loss is recorded in that period 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain and continually assess the adequacy of an allowance for doubtful accounts representing our estimate for losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay amounts due to us 
this estimated allowance is based on historical experience of uncollected accounts  the level of past due accounts  the overall level of outstanding accounts receivable  information about specific customers with respect to their inability to make payments and expectations of future conditions that could impact the collectibility of accounts receivable 
however  future changes in our customers operating performance and cash flows or in general economic conditions could have an impact on their ability to fully pay these amounts which could have a material impact on our operating results 
impairment of long lived assets we have significant investments in long lived assets  including property and equipment and goodwill 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
the review for impairment of long lived assets and goodwill takes into account estimates of future cash flows 
our estimates of future cash flows are based upon budgets and longer range plans 
these budgets and plans are used for internal purposes and are also the basis for communication with outside parties about future business trends 
while we believe the assumptions we use to estimate future cash flows are reasonable  there can be no assurance that the expected future cash flows will be realized 
as a result  impairment charges that possibly should have been recognized in earlier periods may not be recognized until later periods if actual cash flows deviate unfavorably from earlier estimates 
for assets held for sale or disposal  the fair value of the asset is measured using quoted market prices or an estimation of net realizable value 
based on general economic conditions and conditions specific to our industry  the ultimate amounts realized on assets held for sale may differ materially from their currently estimated realizable values 
accruals for contingent liabilities from time to time  contingencies  such as insurance and legal claims  arise in the normal course of business 
pursuant to current accounting standards  we must evaluate such contingencies to subjectively determine the likelihood that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements as well as evaluating whether the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
if the likelihood is determined to be probable and it can be reasonably estimated  the estimated loss is recorded 
the amounts we record for insurance claims  warranties  legal and other contingent liabilities require judgments regarding the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred 
we use past experience and history  as well as the specific circumstances surrounding each contingent liability in evaluating the amount of liability that should be recorded 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
developing our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  if necessary  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
we recorded a state tax valuation allowance of approximately  during the year ended october  we have not recorded any other valuation allowances as of october  because we believe that future taxable income will  more likely than not  be sufficient to realize the benefits of those assets as the temporary differences in basis reverse over time 
our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
while we believe we have provided adequately for our income tax liabilities in the consolidated financial statements  adverse determinations by taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
new accounting standards in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus opinion on eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf provides guidance on the new requirements for other than temporary impairment and its application to debt and marketable equity investments that are accounted for under sfas no 
the new requirements are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of eitf during the quarter ended january  had no impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in march  the eitf reached a consensus opinion on eitf  participating securities and the two class method under fasb statement no 
 earnings per share 
eitf provides guidance in applying the two class method of calculating earnings per share for companies that have issued securities other than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to participate in any dividends declared and earnings of the company 
the opinion defines what constitutes a participating security and how to apply the two class method of calculating earnings per share to those securities 
eitf became effective during the quarter ended july   and the adoption did not have an impact on our calculation of earnings per share 
in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of to provide accounting and disclosure guidance for employers that sponsor postretirement health care plans that provide prescription drug benefits 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of the act was signed into law on december  the act introduces a prescription drug benefit under medicare as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
the new requirements are effective for interim periods beginning after june  we provide postretirement health benefits that include prescription drug benefits  but this benefit ends when the employee reaches the age of the adoption of fsp during the quarter ended october  had no impact on our postretirement benefit cost 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter the amendments made by sfas no 
clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and require the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the guidance is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after november  we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
sfas no 
r will require that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
sfas no 
r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans 
sfas no 
r replaces fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
 as originally issued in  established as preferable a fair value based method of accounting for share based payment transactions with employees 
however  that statement permitted entities the option of continuing to apply the guidance in apb opinion no 
 as long as the footnotes to financial statements disclosed what net income would have been had the preferable fair value based method been used 
public entities will be required to apply sfas no 
r as of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  we are in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of sfas no 
r will have on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions we have entered into in the normal course of business 
these risks primarily relate to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
we are subject to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates related to our outstanding debt and investments in marketable debt securities 
regarding our various debt instruments outstanding at october  and  a basis point increase in interest rates would result in a total annual increase in interest expense of less than  our investments in marketable debt securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet  with unrealized gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income 
changes in interest rates will affect the fair value of the marketable securities as reported 
while we do not currently have any derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk  we have in the past and may in the future enter into such contracts 
overall  we believe that changes in interest rates will not have a material near term impact on our future earnings or cash flows 
during each of the past three years  we have not experienced a significant effect on our business due to changes in interest rates 
our market risk associated with foreign currency rates is not considered to be material  since we primarily arrange compensation in us dollars 
during each of the past three years  we have not experienced a significant effect on our business due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
we are subject to market risk from fluctuating market prices of certain raw materials 
while such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers  commodity raw materials are subject to price fluctuations 
we attempt to pass along such commodity price increases to our customers on a contract by contract basis to avoid profit margin erosion 
while we may do so in the future  we have not entered into any derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to commodity risk in fiscal years  or during  we experienced significant price pressures with some of our key raw materials 
competitive market pressures limited our ability to pass these cost increases to our customers  thus eroding our earnings in we did not experience a significant effect on our business due to fluctuations in commodity prices in or fluctuations in commodity prices may have a material near term effect on our future earnings and cash flows
